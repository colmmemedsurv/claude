      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rischin D, Hansen AR, Cohen EEW, Tahara M, Harrington KJ, Haddad RI, Licitra L, Mehanna H, Ferris RL, Koralewski P, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41427951/'&gt;41427951&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Feladilimab, an inducible T-cell co‑stimulatory receptor agonist, demonstrated clinical activity in combination with pembrolizumab in a Phase I head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) expansion cohort, prompting further evaluation in patients in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li H, Ding Y, Wu Y, Fang Y, Li X, Shi W, Chen S, Yang A, Zhang J, Shi R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70145'&gt;10.1002/hed.70145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424359/'&gt;41424359&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The gingiva and floor of the mouth are distinct subsites, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) originating in these locations warrants further indepth understanding. METHODS: This study enrolled patients with OSCC from 2000 to 2020, and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model examined the risk factors on survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 885 OSCC patients were included, with the most common tumor subsites: oral tongue (41.9%), gingiva (31.8%), and floor of mouth (16.0%). Gingival and floor of mouth showed a higher proportion of advanced stage (65.8%, 66.9%) and significantly poorer OS (3-year: 63.0%, 57.0%; 5-year: 49.8%, 37.3%) and RFS (3-year: 59.1%, 61.3%; 5-year: 55.5%, 57.0%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly reduced mortality in gingival cancer (HR = 0.598), while tobacco exposure (HR = 1.952) was associated with a significant increase in mortality in floor of mouth cancer. CONCLUSION: Gingival cancer and floor of mouth cancer have a worse prognosis, and thus require greater attention throughout the entire management process.</description>

However, their functional contribution to tumor progression remains unclear. METHODS: We identified and characterized a subset of mitotically active (MA)-PGCCs in human oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens and cell lines. Mitotic activity and cell cycle was assessed using immunofluorescence, time-lapse microscopy and FUCCI. We evaluated the interactions between MA-PGCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), focusing on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed using cell viability assays. RESULTS: MA-PGCCs exhibited both bipolar and multipolar mitosis, generating heterogeneous progeny that contributed to genomic instability. These cells increased the number of CAFs with elevated TGF-β expression, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing resistance to 5-FU. Mechanistically, enhanced reactive oxygen species in MA-PGCCs upregulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR, promoting plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β secreted from adjacent CAFs. Upregulation of TGF-β receptors in MA-PGCCs further amplified TGF-β signaling, accelerating EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify MA-PGCCs as a proliferative subpopulation that promotes EMT and chemoresistance through a TGF-β-uPA/uPAR feedback loop. Targeting this pathway may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive tumors enriched in MA-PGCCs.</description>

While increasingly used, evidence in oncologic populations remains limited. Our objective was to review JIAD in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and its outcomes. METHODS: Our systematic review was conducted following a predefined protocol (PROSPERO CRD420251043510). Our search strategy was executed on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from January 2013 to October 2025. Studies with HNC patients of all ages who underwent JIAD were included. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies were included with 57 patients. Common tumour characteristics included mandibular location (n = 31; 54.4 %) and squamous cell carcinoma pathology (n = 37; 64.9 %). A fibular free flap was used in all cases (n = 57; 100 %). Majority underwent adjuvant therapy (n = 36; 63.2 %). Prosthesis survival was reported in 6 studies (n = 25/32; 78.1 %) with follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 52 months. Prosthesis removal was commonly due to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (n = 6; 10.5 %). All irradiated implants had successful early osseointegration (n = 99; 100 %). Delayed implant failure was reported in 4 patients (n = 4/36; 11.1 %) with 11 implants in radiotherapy field (n = 11/99; 11.1 %). CONCLUSION: JIAD for HNC patients can have high success in majority of select patients/defects. Although early osseointegration rates were high, oncologic patients receiving adjuvant radiation may remain at elevated risk for ORN-associated prosthesis failure. As such, the risks and benefits of JIAD should be carefully reviewed with the patient, and cancer staging should also be considered.</description>

METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD. Proactive adherence-supporting factors facilitate high adherence in this population. Both real and sham HD-tDCS proved safe, feasible, and well tolerated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials Number (ISRCTN) registry ID ISRCTN57028065.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zou W, Dong L, Pin A, Nilsson R, Kim M, Apinorasethkul O, Pakela J, Friberg A, Koger B, Labarbe R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111349'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111349&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41423134/'&gt;41423134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Clinical translation of ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) delivery to harness potential FLASH effect requires a treatment planning system (TPS) to optimize and calculate dose and dose rate in patients. Proton conformal FLASH treatment aims to deliver pencil beam scanning (PBS) Bragg Peaks to the tumor region with UHDR. In this work, we conducted a treatment planning study for head and neck (H&amp;N) re-irradiation patients using a research-version of a commercial TPS paired with conformal FLASH hardware integrated into a nozzle of a clinical cyclotron-based system. METHODS: Fifteen H&amp;N patients were planned for re-irradiation of 40 GyRBE in 5 fractions to the area of intact tumor. The TPS was configured with validated UHDR beam measurement to generate optimized patient FLASH plans with one or two beams, delivered as single-beam-per-fraction (SBPF). Each beam consists of a deliverable mono-energetic PBS map, a 3D-printable conformal energy modulator design, a selection of aluminum range shifter plates, and a brass aperture. Python scripts with machine-specific delivery timing parameters were used for Monte Carlo dose and dose rate calculations. Clinical VMAT and IMPT plans were also generated for dosimetric comparison. RESULTS: All plans met the tumor target and OAR planning objectives. Conformal FLASH plans showed very similar dose distributions to the clinical IMPT plans. Compared to VMAT plans, both IMPT and FLASH plans have reduced low dose region, maximum cord dose D0.03 cc (8.37 ± 0.94 vs. 3.19 ± 3.81 and 4.32 ± 3.12 GyRBE, respectively), contra-lateral parotid mean dose (1.88 ± 0.99 vs. 0.00 ± 0.01 and 0.00 ± 0.00 GyRBE, respectively) and contra-lateral submandibular gland mean dose (2.49 ± 1.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.13 and 0.19 ± 0.19 GyRBE, respectively). With 500nA quasi-continuous nozzle beam current, the mean dose-averaged dose rate in CTVs of these 15 patients achieved 95.75 ± 22.78 Gy/s. CONCLUSIONS: - We report the deliverable proton conformal FLASH treatment plans for H&amp;N re-irradiation patients using the innovative hardware configuration and measured beam data in our institution. The FLASH plans have very similar plan qualities to clinical IMPT proton plans and were deliverable with our proton machine. The machine specific 3D dose rate distribution can be calculated and displayed in the TPS.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS &gt; 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P &lt; 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P &lt; 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P &lt; 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P &lt; 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P&lt; .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mohamed Mimun M, Jovell-Fernández E, Aveiro-Róbalo TR, Cherepanova Yarolaeva M, Oblitas Bejar F, Pozzi MB, Collado López Y, Gonzalez Anglarill J, Campayo M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15213-6'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15213-6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41420200/'&gt;41420200&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cancer significantly contributes to morbidity and mortality among incarcerated populations globally, yet research on cancer characteristics and outcomes in this vulnerable group remains limited. The purpose of this study is to compare sociodemographic factors, main tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival rates between cancer patients managed within a prison hospitalization unit (PHU) and those treated in a community hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing 63 cancer patients from the PHU with 129 matched controls from the general population, matched by tumor type and age. Sociodemographic variables, risk factors, tumor types, treatment and survival were analyzed. Chi-square tests and Student's t tests were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were applied for survival analysis. The statistical significance level considered was 5% (SPSS v29). RESULTS: The prison population had a higher prevalence of smoking (74.6% vs. 60.5%), alcohol consumption (50.8% vs. 36.4%), and other substance use (25.4% vs. 14.7%) (p &lt; 0.001). The most common types of tumors were gastrointestinal (12%), prostate (9%), and head and neck (9%). Survival was lower for head/neck cancer patients in the PHU and higher in lung cancer patients (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated cancer patients presented a higher prevalence of risk factors but received similar oncological treatments compared to community controls. Survival was poorer for head and neck cancers and unexpectedly better for lung cancer, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. The integrated prison-hospital model may reduce treatment disparities, but barriers to early diagnosis and follow-up remain.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ren X, Wang H, Liu J, Yuan Y, Wu T, Zhang H, Yang D, Yan Y, Xu Y, Wei F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15465-2'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15465-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41420160/'&gt;41420160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Mepitel film on the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and SinoMed Database, from their inception until August 6, 2024. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of Mepitel film on radiodermatitis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Traditional meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies involving 2,313 cancer patients were included. The pooled analysis indicated that Mepitel significantly reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.50, I2 = 67%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to the control groups. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, Mepitel reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.46, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.0001), breast cancer (OR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.68, I2 = 24%, P = 0.0004), and various malignancies (OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.16, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.00001). Mepitel use was also associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe skin injury in radiotherapy patients (RTOG grade II OR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.42, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade III OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.30, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade IV OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, P = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the severity of radiation-induced skin damage (combined RISRAS score, MD= -0.74 95% CI -1.02 to -0.46, I2 = 95%, P &lt; 0.00001; researcher RISRAS score MD= -0.47 95% CI -0.67 to -0.27, I2 = 90%, P &lt; 0.00001; and patient RISRAS score MD= -1.19 95% CI -1.33 to -1.05, I2 = 39%, P &lt; 0.00001). Additionally, patients treated with Mepitel experienced fewer cases of moist desquamation (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.83, I2 = 58%, P = 0.010), and shorter healing times (MD= -4.73, 95%CI -7.16 to -2.30, I2 = 98%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Mepitel interventions significantly reduced RTOG grades and RISRAS scores, decreased the risk of moist desquamation, and shortened healing times for radiation-induced dermatitis in cancer patients. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the relationship between Mepitel and radiation dermatitis in this patient population.</description>

This study investigates the recurrence and MT rates in an Iranian patient cohort with OED, evaluating associations with demographic factors, lifestyle habits, and histopathologic grading systems, with the aim of providing population-specific prognostic insights and enhancing disease prediction and patient outcomes. METHODS: This mixed cohort study included 89 surgically treated patients with OED, followed for 24-168 months. Demographic data, smoking and alcohol consumption history, recurrence, and MT status were collected from medical records. Histopathological grading was performed using both the WHO 2017 classification and a binary grading system. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and statistical tests were applied to identify prognostic factors. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During follow-up, 22.5% (20/89) of patients experienced recurrence, and 30.3% (27/89) underwent MT. The tongue was the most common site for OED (48.3%), recurrence (55%), and MT (44.4%). Males were more frequently affected than females (60.7% vs. 39.3%,), but females tended to remain cancer-free more often. Smoking and alcohol consumption did not significantly influence cancer development. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 50% of MT cases occurred after about 108 months (mean: 114.8 months). The combined mean survival for recurrence and MT was 92.8 months. Cox regression identified WHO grading as the only statistically significant predictor of MT and recurrence/MT (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO grading system plays a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of OED recurrence and malignant transformation. Lesion location showed only a non-significant trend, suggesting that its effect may be mediated by grade. These findings highlight the importance of using grading-based risk assessments and ensuring close follow-up care to better manage OED and improve patient outcomes.</description>

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are emerging as promising biomarkers for predicting ICB response. Early characterization of ctDNA and TCR dynamics may enable timely treatment adjustments before clinical or radiological progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IO-KIN study (NCT04606940) is a single-center, prospective trial involving 15 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Blood samples (n=104) were collected across seven timepoints from baseline to day 29. ctDNA was analyzed using a personalized assay (Signatera), and peripheral TCR repertoires were profiled using CapTCR-seq in eight patients. RESULTS: A decline in ctDNA after day 8 was associated with radiological response, longer progression-free survival, and a trend toward improved overall survival. TCR repertoires transiently diversified between days 8-22, with longer diversification windows in patients showing sustained ctDNA decline. Using the GLIPHII algorithm, an EBV-specific TCR signature was identified and persisted in patients with clinical benefit. Additional TCR signatures, potentially recognizing tumor-associated antigens, emerged as early as day 3 and were linked to positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous early monitoring of ctDNA and TCR dynamics reveals key determinants of ICB outcomes in R/M HNSCC. The transient nature of TCR diversification emphasizes the importance of precise sample timing to guide early therapeutic decisions and improve patient outcomes.</description>

This study evaluated BM management strategies and patients' outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DTC and BM at Tel Aviv Sourasky and Rabin Medical Centers between 1985 and 2024. Clinical features, histopathology, treatments, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified: 11 (55%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma, 8 (40%) had follicular carcinoma and 1 had Hurtle cell carcinoma. BM treatments included neurosurgical resection (n = 9), stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 14), and whole-brain radiotherapy (n = 6). Median survival following BM diagnosis was 16.2 months. Patients who did not undergo surgical resection had significantly shorter survival than those whose BM were resected (13 vs. 80 months, p = 0.03). Survival was also worse among patients receiving systemic therapy at the time BM developed (8.9 vs. 80 months, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Unresected BM of DTC and those arising during systemic therapy portend high mortality.</description>

But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.</description>

The specific characteristics and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in these post-transplant patients are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the risk, characteristics, and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in post-transplant patients. METHODS: This study analyzed the clinical baseline characteristics of OSCC patients with pathological confirmation who had undergone organ transplantation (study group) and non-transplant OSCC patients (control group), all of whom were monitored with comprehensive follow-up. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate whether organ transplantation status was an independent risk factor affecting survival. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were enrolled (study group, n = 17; control group, n = 86). The median age at OSCC diagnosis for study group was 53 years, with tumors primarily located on the tongue (35.3 %), buccal (17.6 %), and gingiva (11.8 %). Control group had a similar median age, with tumors mostly located on the tongue (64.0 %), buccal (16.3 %), and gingiva (8.1 %). Except for one transplant recipient who received conservative management, all patients underwent surgical resection. Cox multivariate analysis identified tumor recurrence (p = 0.002), tumor size (p = 0.016), and vascular invasion (p = 0.006) as significant adverse factors affecting survival. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the importance of organ transplantation history in managing OSCC. Regular screening is essential for early detection and improved survival, particularly under immunosuppressive conditions, in this high-risk group.</description>

Our previous studies demonstrated that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC-PINT enhances the radiosensitivity of NPC cells. However, the clinical relevance of functional polymorphisms in LINC-PINT remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 199 Chinese NPC patients who received concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. The association between the LINC-PINT rs1059698 polymorphism and short-term treatment efficacy (assessed 3 months post-treatment) was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. LINC-PINT expression in NPC tissues was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the effect of rs1059698 on miR-646 binding. Eight machines were further employed learning algorithms to construct predictive models for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: NPC patients with a complete response (CR) showed significantly higher LINC-PINT expression than those with partial response (PR) or progressive disease (PD) (P &lt; 0.05). The rs1059698 CC genotype was significantly associated with an improved treatment response (CR vs. PR + PD, OR = 0.189, 95% CI: 0.042-0.860, P = 0.031). Individuals carrying the CC genotype also exhibited approximately 1.5-fold higher LINC-PINT expression compared to AA genotype carriers (P &lt; 0.001). Functional analysis showed that the A-to-C substitution at rs1059698 disrupted miR-646 binding to LINC-PINT. Additionally, the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model incorporating rs1059698 and clinical variables achieved moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.765 in training and 0.641 in validation). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the rs1059698 polymorphism were associated with NPC treatment response possibly by influencing the expression of LINC-PINT or altering miRNA-lncRNA interaction. LINC-PINT rs1059698 may serve as a predictive biomarker for chemoradiotherapy efficacy in NPC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Scholfield DW, Boe LA, Eagan A, Levyn H, Kavanagh F, Tuttle RM, Shaha AR, Cracchiolo JR, Shah JP, Wong RJ, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4653'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41411004/'&gt;41411004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with lateral neck metastases (N1b) are usually treated with total thyroidectomy (TT), neck dissection, and adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI). This philosophy comes with higher risks of complications and sequela than thyroid lobectomy (TL) and neck dissection alone. There are no prior studies on patients from the Western hemisphere that compare survival and recurrence outcomes between these groups. OBJECTIVE: To compare recurrence and survival outcomes in propensity-matched TL vs TT + RAI patients who presented with ipsilateral N1b PTC at a tertiary cancer center in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort propensity-matched study was conducted at a single US tertiary cancer center included 37 TL patients and 37 of 561 TT + RAI patients (after excluding patients with M1 disease), with a median (IQR) follow-up of 113 (58-241) and 90 (48-185) months, respectively. Adult patients with PTC with lateral neck node metastases (N1b) were identified from a thyroid cancer database. The study included patients undergoing surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1986 to 2020, inclusive, and the study was conducted from 2024 to 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Of 598 total individuals, the median (IQR) age was 41 (33-55) years, and 341 (57%) were female. The 5-year OS was 96.9% in the TL group and 96.8% in the TT + RAI group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03-1.58). The 5-year DSS was 96.7% in the TL group and 100% in the TT +RAI group. The 5-year RFS was 89.8% in the TL group and 88.9% in the TT + RAI group (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.39-5.58). The survival rates did not change between 5 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that a select group of patients with N1b PTC treated with TL had no important difference in survival and recurrence outcomes compared with patients treated with TT + RAI. Therefore, TL is an effective and safe treatment option in carefully selected and appropriately counselled patients with N1b PTC with unilateral tumors and low-volume regional lymph node metastases without clinical extranodal extension.</description>

However, whether pathologic treatment response is a meaningful surrogate end point for survival has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the association between pathologic treatment response and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after neoadjuvant ICI. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed from January 1, 2000, through May 31, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed studies investigating neoadjuvant ICI for the treatment of mucosal HNSCC in patients 18 years and older were identified. Full-length English-language articles that presented pathologic treatment response and survival data (OS and/or DFS) and any association between the 2 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three blinded reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, pathologic treatment response data, and survival data, including hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs when available, according to PRISMA guideline. Data were compiled for statistical analysis to calculate DFS, OS, and HRs using a random-effects model. The I2 index was used to report data heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: HRs for the association of pathologic treatment response with DFS and OS. RESULTS: Eleven trials involving 451 patients met inclusion criteria, with 368 patients included in this meta-analysis. Nine nonrandomized and 2 randomized studies were included, including 7 cohort studies, 2 randomized clinical trials, and 2 retrospective cohort studies, each with a different neoadjuvant ICI regimen. Pooled analysis demonstrated that overall (primary tumor plus lymph node) partial pathologic response (PPR; ≤50% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; I2 = 2.1%) and major pathologic response (MPR; ≤10% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.93; I2 = 0.0%) were both associated with improved DFS up to 2 years. PPR and MPR were not associated with improved OS. Nine of 11 studies were at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study findings suggest that overall PPR and MPR are associated with improved DFS. These data provide additional support for the potential use of pathologic treatment response as a surrogate for DFS after neoadjuvant ICI in resectable mucosal HNSCC.</description>

Malignancies of the sinonasal cavity are particularly rare with an overall incidence of approximately 0.56 cases per 100,000 population per year. Additionally, clinical behavior varies with a reported 5-year overall survival rate ranging from 22% - 67%. Here we describe our initial efforts including formation of an international network dedicated to sinonasal cancer research and highlight keys for successful study of rare tumors. This network first began with large multi-institutional retrospective collaborations of rare sinonasal tumors leading to improvements in staging for olfactory neuroblastoma and sinonasal melanoma. These efforts have been followed by a new emphasis on development of collaborative interventional trials as well as the development of position statements and recommendations to guide use of emerging molecularly targeted therapies. In order to be successful in studying rare malignancies, collaboration and teamwork is key along with an unrelenting drive for development of evidence to help guide treatment for rare cancers. This manuscript serves as an outline that may be applied by other interested groups to improve the study of other tumors in the human body.</description>

However, the relative advantages of mechanical stapling compared to hand-sewn techniques for cervical esophagojejunal anastomosis remain unclear. This study aimed to compare postoperative outcomes between these two approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review on 28 patients undergoing free jejunal transfer after total pharyngolaryngectomy between 2014 and 2020. Patients were divided into a mechanical stapler group (n = 12) and a hand-sewn group (n = 16). Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications within 30 days and functional outcomes at or beyond 6 months postoperatively (mechanical stapler: n = 8; hand-sewn: n = 10). We conducted statistical analysis using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was similar between groups. Median operative time was significantly shorter with mechanical stapling (437 vs 540 minutes; P = .002). Functional outcomes, including oral intake and dysphagia symptoms, showed no significant differences. Nasal regurgitation was less frequent with stapling (37.5% vs 90%; P = .043). One anastomotic stricture occurred in the stapler group and we successfully treated it with two sessions of endoscopic balloon dilatation. CONCLUSION: Mechanical stapling provides comparable functional outcomes to hand-sewn anastomosis while offering the advantage of shorter operative time. These findings support its use as a practical and efficient alternative for cervical esophagojejunal reconstruction following total pharyngolaryngectomy, particularly in settings seeking to optimize both efficiency and safety.

The survival equivalence of surgery versus chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for cT4a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cT4a LSCC patients treated with curative-intent surgery or CRT using the National Cancer Database (2010-2021). Those receiving neoadjuvant or palliative therapy, or with distant metastases were excluded. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models after 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among 3569 patients (mean age 61.0, 708 female), 2437 (68.3%) underwent surgery while 1132 (31.7%) received CRT. In the matched cohort (n = 452 per arm), median survival was 52.8 (95% CI: 45.6-62.4) versus 37.6 (95% CI: 29.2-45.4) months for surgery versus CRT. Adjusted HR for CRT relative to surgery was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.02-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with definitive CRT in patients with T4a LSCC.</description>

Studies have shown that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) are potential prognostic markers in p16-negative LASCCL. This study analyzes the predictive value of NLR and LMR. METHODS: Samples from 193 LASCCL patients treated with chemotherapy were reviewed. Response to induction chemotherapy was tested with logistic regression. Optimal cut-points were determined by Youden's index. Survival was tested with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: LMR had a positive association, NLR had a negative association with response to chemotherapy (p = 0.004;0.07). Response was higher in patients with LMR ≥ 2.8 (p = 0.0007) and NLR ≤ 2.8 (p = 0.04). Overall and disease-specific survival improved with LMR ≥ 2.8 (p = 0.0002;0.004) and NLR ≤ 2.8 (p = 0.10;0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low NLR and high LMR were associated with favorable responses to chemotherapy and survival in LASCCL.</description>

However, whether these programs are safe and effective for older patients who have undergone free-flap reconstruction for locally advanced oral cancers remains unclear. This study retrospectively evaluated the risk factors associated with delayed postoperative recovery and prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) in older patients with locally advanced oral cancer who underwent resection and free-flap reconstruction from an ERAS perspective. METHODS: Sixty-one patients who underwent resection and free-flap reconstruction for locally advanced oral cancer were included. LOS, complications, nutritional intake, and mobilization were evaluated. RESULTS: The older group exhibited a longer LOS, delayed oral feeding, and more aspiration pneumonia than the non-older group. Analysis of older adults only revealed delayed oral feeding, not chronological age, as a risk factor for prolonged LOS. CONCLUSIONS: Older patients were safely managed using ERAS; however, dysphagia may have interfered with the enhanced recovery.</description>

This study aimed to identify perioperative and postoperative factors linked to LOI in geriatric HNC patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2021-2023 ACS-NSQIP data. Patients aged ≥ 75 years who underwent HNC surgery with preoperative and discharge functional status data were included. The primary outcome was LOI, defined as a decline in functional status at discharge compared to baseline. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of LOI. RESULTS: Among 4290 patients, 471 (10.9%) experienced LOI. LOI was associated with diabetes (p = 0.001), metastatic disease (p = 0.037), smoking (p = 0.001), dementia (p &lt; 0.0001), and falling within 6 months (p &lt; 0.0001). Longer operative times (mean 320.89 vs. 63.68 min, p &lt; 0.0001) and hospital stays ≥ 2 days (p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with LOI. Overweight and obese patients had lower odds of LOI (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: [0.57, 0.98]; OR: 0.70, 95% CI: [0.52, 0.95]). Operative time &gt; 5 h (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: [1.1-2.35]) and length of stay ≥ 2 days (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: [1.48-3.07]) were associated with LOI. Surgical procedures linked to higher odds included free flap (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: [1.70-8.39]), laryngeal resection (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: [1.40-11.34]), neck dissection (OR: 2.78, 95% CI: [1.29-5.99]), regional flap (OR: 3.85, 95% CI: [1.80-8.27]), and total glossectomy (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: [1.02-6.86]). CONCLUSION: Identifying patients at risk for LOI may guide surgical decision-making in older adults undergoing HNC surgery.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bajaj K, Ramadoss R, Sundar S, Selvam SP, Shree K H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107816'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107816&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41401591/'&gt;41401591&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a large source of cancer-related morbidity in India especially when it involves the tongue and the buccal mucosa. Despite the fact that TNM staging provides a global framework, regional patterns of metastasis, comorbidity interaction and concordance between imaging and pathology are not uniformly represented. This study will investigate nodal disease patterns in a group of people in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) and will suggest more specific treatments. The research aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention pathways and to reduce inequality in healthcare service provision. METHODS: Twenty patients with OSCC who had been diagnosed between 2023 and 2025 were the subjects of a retrospective study conducted on tertiary oncology centres in Delhi NCR. Inclusion criteria were confirmation of primary OSCC of the tongue or buccal mucosa, availability of PET -CT or MRI images, full TNM staging, and comorbidity information. Data visualization included heatmaps, scatter plot, cluster diagram and radar charts. Along with the imaging concordance, tumour site, the size of the lesion, nodal involvement, and the burden of comorbidity were evaluated. RESULTS: Bilateral nodal involvement was higher in the Tongue OSCC, mostly at Level II and III, but the tumours of the buccal mucosa were mostly limited to Level Ib unilateral. Nodal burden was much higher in lesions of around 3.5 cm. Comorbidities (diabetes and chronic kidney disease) were also related to higher FDG uptake and necrosis, but the relationships were not statistically significant. PET-CT had 85 percent agreement with the pathology of the surgery. The decision of treatment was based on the staging with surgery being the preferred treatment option in early disease and chemoradiation in advanced ones. CONCLUSION: The site and size of tumour have a significant impact on nodal dissemination in OSCC. Bilateral neck dissection can be a wise option in case of early tongue lesions involving the midline but selective unilateral dissection is adequate in selecting cases involving the buccal lesions. It is necessary to couple comorbidity profiling with imaging results when planning pre-treatment. In this study, health systems, health equity, and collaborative oncology care are strengthened.</description>

METHOD: Patients who were followed up in the oncology clinic between January 2014 and December 2024 and who could not undergo an organ-sparing approach or surgery were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, biochemical and inflammatory parameters of the patients were examined. Binary-logistic regression analysis was used for patients who could not complete the treatment due to toxicity, Cox-regression analysis was used to investigate the factors affecting overall survival (OS), and Roc-curve analysis was used to determine the ideal-cut-off values ​​for blood markers. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients with HNSCC were included in the study. In univariate logistic regression analysis, age ≥ 60 (p = 0.006), presence of comorbidity (p = 0.029), body mass index (BMI) &lt; 23.25 (p = 0.005), poor ECOG performance score (2-3) (p &lt; 0.001) and low prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (p = 0.011) were found to be significant risk factors for not completing treatment. Multivariate logistic regression of age, BMI, ECOG, and PNI together formed a predictive model for treatment incompletion. In Cox regression analysis, BMI &lt;23.25 (p=0.016), poor ECOG performance score (2-3) (p=0.002), advanced disease stage (p=0.002), and low PNI (&lt;51.1) (p=0.006) were the main risk factors for unfavorable overall survival. Gender, smoking, tumor location, treatment regimen, and hematological parameters had no significant effect on survival and treatment completion. CONCLUSION: In HNSCC patients who underwent post-induction CRT, nutritional parameters such as BMI and PNI and performance status play a determining role on treatment tolerance and survival. Detailed assessment of nutritional status before treatment may have an impact on treatment success and survival.</description>

Extracellular vesicles (EVs), especially those derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have emerged as promising targeted drug carriers for cancer cells. Additionally, reprogramming MSC-derived EVs represents a novel strategy for cancer gene therapy, offering potential solutions to clinical challenges and new treatment directions. Increasing evidence suggests that MSC-derived EVs play a crucial role in tumor progression by delivering circular RNAs (circRNAs), which function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms and their clinical applications remain to be fully explored and validated. METHODS AND RESULTS: Through in-depth mining using high-throughput bioinformatics analyses, we conducted a comprehensive differential gene analysis between PTC tissues and normal thyroid tissues, successfully identifying circ-0000258 as a key regulatory molecule. Following multi-dimensional validation in PTC cell lines and clinical specimens, the consistent low expression of circ-0000258 was confirmed, strongly suggesting its latent potential as a tumor suppressor. Functional mechanistic investigations have revealed that overexpression of circ-0000258 potently curbs the malignant biological behaviors of PTC cells, notably inhibiting cell proliferation and invasion. More significantly, circ-0000258 acts as a molecular sponge, specifically sequestering miR-146b. This action relieves the post-transcriptional repression of p53 by miR-146b, thereby activating the p53-mediated apoptotic signaling cascade. By intervening at the genetic regulatory level, circ-0000258 effectively reprograms the fate of thyroid tumor cells. Furthermore, in the context of translational medicine research, we innovatively constructed an engineered delivery platform based on extracellular vesicles derived from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSC-EVs). By exogenously loading circ-0000258 into these vesicles, we successfully endowed these natural nanocarriers with targeted anti-cancer properties. Both in vitro and in vivo functional assays demonstrated that the engineered hUCMSC-EVs loaded with circ-0000258 could effectively act on PTC cells, significantly reducing the volume of xenograft tumors and inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Notably, when combined with cisplatin, these engineered extracellular vesicles exhibited a synergistic anti-cancer effect, suggesting their potential to overcome chemoresistance in thyroid tumors. CONCLUSION: This study has established the circ-0000258/miR-146b/p53 regulatory axis as a crucial mechanism underlying tumor suppression in PTC. It has also demonstrated the translational potential of hUCMSC-EVs as a safe and efficient delivery vehicle. By integrating the functional role of circ-0000258 with the targeted delivery advantages of engineered EVs, this research not only provides a novel strategy for the targeted treatment of thyroid cancer but also offers a theoretical basis and technical paradigm for the development of novel anti-tumor biological agents. It is anticipated to advance the field of precision oncology to a new level.</description>

This study explores how artificial intelligence (AI) can support early detection by analyzing intraoral photographs. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was performed using 518 intraoral clinical images collected from the Department of Oral Medicine, Kerman Faculty of Dentistry, between 2009 and 2023. The dataset comprised 104 images of malignant lesions and 414 of benign or normal tissue, all confirmed by a specialist in oral pathology. Three pretrained deep learning models, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, and ResNet-50, were evaluated for their ability to classify lesions as malignant or benign. The data were split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets, with preprocessing completed before analysis. RESULTS: Among the models, DenseNet-121 demonstrated superior performance, achieving 91% accuracy, 75% sensitivity, 98% specificity, 75% positive predictive value, 96% negative predictive value, an F1 score of 84%, and an area under the curve of 90%. These results exceeded the diagnostic accuracy of an experienced oral specialist. CONCLUSION: AI-based analysis of clinical images can significantly improve early oral cancer detection and should be integrated into clinical workflows to enhance diagnostic precision.</description>

This has prompted extensive research into biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes beyond conventional staging systems. This mini review summarizes findings from the existing literature to provide a comprehensive examination of the prognostic significance of malignancy and progression factors in OSCC, offering insights into future perspectives. There is clear evidence that molecular and protein-based biomarkers, in addition to established clinical and histopathological features, such as lymph node involvement, extranodal spread, and depth of invasion, strongly correlate with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Integrating different gene expression signatures, microRNA (miRNA) profiles, and changes in intracellular signaling pathways enables more differentiated risk stratification. Protein biomarkers such as cyclin D1, trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and E-cadherin have been shown to provide clinically useful prognostic information. These results underscore the importance of incorporating biomarkers into individualized risk stratification to enhance personalized treatment regimens and outcomes for OSCC patients. Currently, however, established clinical and histopathological parameters, as well as a limited number of validated molecular profiles, remain the most reliable prognostic indicators. While identifying new biomarkers is promising, establishing standardized protocols and implementing careful prospective validation are essential to ensuring their seamless integration into standard clinical practice.</description>

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer promise for nodal assessment, but clinical utility and reporting quality remain variable. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2020-2025. Eleven eligible studies (4 core, 7 supportive) addressed ENE (n=2) or LNM prediction (n=2), with additional supportive studies on segmentation, lymphatic spread modeling, MRI radiomics, and outcomes modeling. Extracted variables included study characteristics, performance metrics, validation, calibration, and unit of analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST; reporting quality was evaluated with TRIPOD. Due to heterogeneity and limited study numbers, no meta-analysis was performed; results were narratively synthesized. For ENE, we report study-level accuracy, decision-curve analysis (DCA), and per-1,000 management impact. RESULTS: All core studies were CT-based. The task-specific deep-learning ENE model achieved AUC 0.86 with balanced operating points, while the generalist LVLM (Large Vision-Language Model) reached sensitivity 1.00 with specificity 0.34. DCA favored the DL model across thresholds 0.10-0.40, showing fewer unnecessary dissections per 1,000 patients than Treat-all or L(V)LM. For LNM, discrimination was high (AUC 0.865-0.919), calibration was reported, and one study included external validation, though threshold-level sensitivity/specificity were missing. External validation was reported in 25% of core studies, calibration in 50%; TRIPOD adherence was 74.5% overall, with frequent under-reporting of blinding and missing-data handling. CONCLUSIONS: AI and radiomics show promising potential for preoperative prediction of ENE and LNM in oropharyngeal cancer. Task-specific deep-learning models achieve balanced discrimination, while generalist LVLMs provide high recall at lower specificity. For LNM, encouraging performance is reported, but limited external validation and absent standardized thresholds still preclude clinical use. Broader validation and harmonized reporting are essential before translation into practice. REGISTRATION/PROTOCOL: Not registered; methods followed PRISMA/TRIPOD/PROBAST guidance.</description>

Despite advances in treatment, reliable biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of HNC remain lacking. The α-Gal carbohydrate epitope, absent in humans but present in other mammals, has garnered interest due to the natural presence of anti-α-Gal antibodies in the human immune repertoire, comprising approximately 1% of total circulating IgG. We investigated the role of anti-α-Gal IgG as a potential biomarker by performing ELISA on serum samples from a cohort of 11 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Eight were older male patients, most of whom lived in rural areas and engaged in manual occupations. High rates of tobacco (81.8%) and alcohol consumption (63.6%) were observed, in line with established risk factors for HNC. These individuals showed significantly elevated anti-α-Gal antibody titers compared to non-cancer controls. Chemotherapy with cisplatin did not markedly affect antibody levels, suggesting consistent immune reactivity across treatment status. These results suggest that anti-α-Gal antibodies may serve as promising biomarker candidates in HNC and warrant further investigation to clarify their potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic applications.</description>

METHODS: The research subjects were patients with head and neck tumors who underwent free flap reconstruction in our hospital, The clinical-relevant data of all patients were collected. Patients were randomly divided into training set and validation set at the ratio of 7:3. Univariate and multivariate analyses using Logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative complications. The random forest algorithm was further used to construct the prediction model, and the performance of the model was verified by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve evaluation, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A total of 341 patients were included in the study, and 82 cases (24.05%) had postoperative complications. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, operation time, bleeding volume, flap type and flap area were the independent risk factors for complications after free flap reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer (P &lt; 0.05). The contribution magnitudes of each variable obtained from the random forest model was flap resection area, intraoperative bleeding volume, age, operation time, flap type and concomitant hypertension. The calibration curve of the constructed Nomogram model showed that the predicted value was in good agreement with the actual value, and the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.793 (95% CI: 0.711-0.874) and 0.788 (95% CI: 0.665-0.912), respectively, showing good prediction performance. The DCA analysis indicated that the model had good clinical application value. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression and random forest algorithm can effectively analyze the influencing factors of complications after free flap reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer and construct accurate prediction model. This model can provide a scientific theoretical reference for the prevention of postoperative complications and facilitate the precise optimization of individualized prevention plans based on risk prediction.</description>

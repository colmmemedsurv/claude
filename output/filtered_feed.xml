      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sousa-Neto SS, Nakamura TCR, Dos Santos GC, Giraldo-Roldan D, Gonçalves MWA, de Cáceres CVBL, Fonseca FP, Moreira VHLO, Mendonça EF, Martins MD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.09.018'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.09.018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Mar-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41591939/'&gt;41591939&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Although artificial intelligence tools show promise for enhancing the diagnosis of head and neck lesions, few studies have tested these resources for the microscopic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. Specifically, the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinoma and secretory carcinoma has never been addressed in this context. Therefore, this exploratory study aimed to comparatively evaluate the feasibility of applying convolutional neural networks for the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinomas and secretory carcinomas. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using whole-slide images from 46 patients with acinic cell carcinoma (n = 26) or secretory carcinoma (n = 20) was conducted. Eight CNNs (ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetV2B0) were trained and evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and AUC. Performance was measured in training, validation, and test subsets. Accuracy and loss curves were also presented. RESULTS: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best overall performance, with the lowest loss (1.39), highest accuracy (0.81), sensitivity (0.90), and F1-score (0.81). VGG16 achieved the highest AUC (0.86) and precision (0.77). DenseNet121 showed the lowest performance in terms of accuracy (0.65) and F1-Score (0.52), but the highest specificity (0.85). CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study suggests that convolutional neural networks may be feasible tools to support the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinoma and secretory carcinoma. The performance of these models critically depends on the size of the dataset and the quality of annotations. The findings should be interpreted cautiously given the limited dataset and potential sources of bias. Further validation with larger, multicenter datasets is needed before any clinical application can be considered.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Anbari F, Heydari SM, Bakhtiari S, Younesi Pour Masouleh S, Azghandi S, Bakhtiyari H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-026-15571-9'&gt;10.1186/s12885-026-15571-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41618210/'&gt;41618210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced hyposalivation is a common and debilitating side effect of head and neck radiotherapy, significantly impairing patients' quality of life. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant, is hypothesized to enhance salivary secretion and promote the regeneration of acinar cells. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of ALA on unstimulated salivary flow rate in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 20 patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (receiving 1200 mg/day ALA) or to the control group (receiving placebo) for three months. Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (mL/min) was measured using the spitting method at baseline (pre-radiotherapy) and at weeks 2, 6, 8, and 12 post-radiotherapy. Xerostomia severity was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), alongside clinical signs of hyposalivation (e.g., frothy saliva, mucosal adherence). Data were analyzed using t-tests and Fisher's exact test in SPSS version 25.00, with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Although both groups indicated a decline in salivary flow over time, no significant intergroup differences were observed at any follow-up point (P &gt; 0.05). Within the ALA group, pairwise comparisons revealed a significant reduction in salivary flow from baseline to weeks 6, 8, and 12 (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, and P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, a significant reduction was observed between weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.011). No significant differences between groups were found in NRS scores or clinical indicators of hyposalivation during any follow-up session (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 1200 mg/day ALA may temporarily delay the onset of salivary gland dysfunction in the early phases of radiotherapy. However, this effect was not statistically significant and may not have a sustained clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (IR.SBMU.DRC.REC.1401.062) and registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20221219056864N1, registered on December 19, 2022).</description>

A subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Data regarding HPV-driven HNSCC from low- and middle-income countries is lacking. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentre study of adult patients diagnosed with primary HNSCC between 2016 and 2020 was carried out. HPV status was determined through detection of high-risk HPV mRNA via in situ hybridization (RNAISH). Tumours were classified as being HPV-driven when there was positivity for RNAISH. p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV DNA detection and genotyping (HPVDNA) via a PCR-based method were also carried out. The prognostic utility of RNAISH, p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) alone and combined p16INK4a &amp; HPVDNA were assessed using survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 356 cases of HNSCC were assessed for HPV status. Median age was 64 years (IQR: 15), and 69.9% of patients were males. The prevalence of HPV-driven HNSCC was approximately 11.0% (95% CI: 7.9-14.7%). The vast majority of HPV-driven HNSCC were from the oropharynx (94.9%). None of the tumours originating from the oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx were HPV-driven. Seven different genotypes were found in HPV-driven HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, HPV-driven HNSCC was primarily encountered in tumours originating from the oropharynx. HPV16 was the most frequently encountered genotype in our cohort. It is recommended that determination of HPV status be based on single testing with RNAISH or dual testing of p16INK4a IHC in conjunction with HPVDNA as an acceptable alternative in resource limited settings to improve patient stratification for treatment as well as clinical outcomes.</description>

METHODS: This prospective, single-center, and randomized controlled trial included 196 patients with PTC who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ETGUA group (n = 98) or the open thyroidectomy group (n = 98). Complications within 30 days, parathyroid function [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium], and short-term oncological outcomes were observed. Secondary outcomes included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative recovery, pain score, cosmetic satisfaction, and hospitalization cost. RESULTS: The ETGUA group had a significantly longer operative time than the open thyroidectomy group, less intraoperative blood loss, more postoperative drainage at postoperative day 1, as well as a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all p &lt; 0.05). At 1 year postoperatively, surgical efficacy and oncological indicators such as the number of lymph nodes dissected, number of positive lymph nodes, stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) level, and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy were comparable between groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ETGUA group reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and higher cosmetic satisfaction, though the total hospitalization cost was slightly higher (all p &lt; 0.05). The learning curve analysis indicated that operative time and intraoperative blood loss stabilized after approximately 30-40 cases. CONCLUSION: ETGUA demonstrates comparable safety and oncological efficacy to conventional open thyroidectomy in PTC patients.</description>

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients who underwent a salvage oropharyngectomy in an irradiated neck for recurrent or metachronous oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) between 2014 and 2023. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included. Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were 31.7%, 58.5%, and 55.2%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, pN+ status (HR 2.32; p = 0.031), pT status ≥ 3 (HR 2.03; p = 0.020), and age (HR 1.05; p = 0.014) were associated with OS. DSS was associated with pT status ≥ 3 (HR 5.24; p &lt; 0.001), metachronous (vs. recurrent) OPSCC (HR 0.32; p = 0.006), and cN+ status (HR 2.31; p = 0.053). LRFS was associated with metachronous OPSCC (HR 0.30; p = 0.002) and pT status ≥ 3 (HR 3.60; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This last-resort procedure is associated with poor survival outcomes. In this series, patients with p16-positive OPSCC did not fare better than their p16-negative counterparts.</description>

Evidence suggests that LN colonization induces systemic immunosuppression, facilitating distant metastasis. We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-γ signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of NBTXR3 followed by RT in patients with locally advanced HNSCC ineligible to receive concurrent systemic therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-arm, phase 1 dose-expansion nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 centers in Europe between March 4, 2019, and January 10, 2022. Patients were ineligible for cisplatin and cetuximab per investigator's judgement and had unresectable T3-4 or overall stage III/IVA HNSCC (per the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition) of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Data were analyzed from July to August 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received a single intratumoral administration of NBTXR3 in the primary tumor at the recommended dose of 22% of estimated tumor volume (ETV) followed by RT (70 Gy over 35 fractions). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were safety and efficacy assessed by the objective response rate (ORR) of the NBTXR3-injected primary tumor. Other outcomes included ORR of all lesions (injected primary tumor and noninjected involved lymph nodes), progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 56 patients treated, the median (range) age was 72 (44-89) years, 40 (71%) were men, 34 (61%) were 70 years and older, and 36 (64%) had a substantial burden of comorbidities (age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 4 or greater). Median (range) follow-up was 33.0 (0.7-44.6) months. NBTXR3-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 9 patients (16%), of which 6 (11%) were grade 3 or higher, the most frequent being stomatitis (2 [4%]). Objective tumor response was assessed in 44 patients, as 12 patients were unable to complete RT or did not have posttreatment tumor assessment. In this evaluable patient population, the ORR of the injected primary tumor and ORR of all lesions were 82% (95% CI, 67-92) and 80% (95% CI, 65-90), respectively. Among all 56 treated patients, the median progression-free survival was 11.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 to not reached), and the median overall survival was 18.1 months (95% CI, 9.7 to not reached). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This dose-expansion phase 1 nonrandomized clinical trial demonstrated that intratumoral NBTXR3 followed by RT in a high-risk patient population unable to receive cisplatin or cetuximab was feasible and had a preliminary efficacy signal that supports a benefit-risk profile being evaluated in an ongoing randomized phase III trial.

However, the long-term survival benefits at the 5-year benchmark remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding camrelizumab to chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS) as first-line treatment for RM-NPC, compared with chemotherapy alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CAPTAIN-1st trial was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial conducted at 28 hospitals in China. Between November 13, 2018, and November 29, 2019, patients with treatment-naive RM-NPC were enrolled. This secondary analysis of the CAPTAIN-1st trial was prespecified. Data analysis was conducted on June 1, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive camrelizumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or completion of 2 years of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary end point, progression-free survival per independent review committee, has been reported previously. Herein, the secondary end point of OS is reported as prespecified in the protocol. RESULTS: Among 263 randomized patients (134 in randomized to camrelizumab, 129 to placebo), baseline characteristics were generally balanced between groups, except for age. The mean (SD) age was 49 (11.25) years, and 218 patients (82.9%) were male individuals, 45 (17.1%) were female individuals. With a median survival follow-up of 63.5 (95% CI, 61.2-64.6) months for the camrelizumab group and 63.0 (95% CI, 60.8-64.6) months for the placebo group, 85 (63.4%) and 95 (73.6%) deaths occurred, respectively. Median OS was 34.5 months (95% CI, 29.4-45.7) with camrelizumab vs 26.6 months (95% CI, 19.8-33.5) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; 2-sided P = .047). After adjusting for age imbalance, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P = .01). The 5-year OS rates were 37.8% vs 24.2%, reflecting an absolute difference of 13.6% (95% CI, 2.4%-24.8%; P = .02) in favor of camrelizumab. The OS benefits were generally consistent across subgroups. In the camrelizumab group, patients who achieved rapid clearance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA had significantly longer OS compared with those without EBV DNA clearance (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful 5-year OS benefits compared with chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of RM-NPC. These findings provided the first 5-year evidence supporting the benefit of PD-1-based chemoimmunotherapy in this setting.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang SY, Turner G, Valdes-Morales KL, Hunter ER, Kim M, Tran VA, Polen K, Haynes D, Miller CJ, Etzkorn JR, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5211'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609724/'&gt;41609724&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine malignant neoplasm often affecting the head and neck. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely performed; however, the accuracy and reliability of SLNB for head and neck MCC remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of SLNB in head and neck MCC and inform pre- and post-SLNB risk stratification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center cohort study of patients with clinically node-negative head and neck MCC who underwent SLNB from January 2006 to January 2025; median (IQR) follow-up was 1.9 (0.8-4.6) years. Data analysis was conducted from April to November 2025. INTERVENTIONS: SLNB outcome and nodal disease status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SLNB accuracy measured by sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and false negative (FN) rate. FN SLNB was defined as regional nodal recurrence at the first site of recurrence after a negative SLNB without concurrent local or in-transit recurrence. Factors associated with failed SLNB (defined as nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy, inability to identify the sentinel lymph node intraoperatively, or absence of nodal tissue in the pathology specimen) were evaluated using effect-size measures. Cox proportional hazards model identified factors associated with nodal disease, comparing patients who developed nodal disease (identified by SLNB or subsequent clinical and/or imaging evaluation) with those who did not develop nodal disease during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 86 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.6 [9.6] years; 36 female [41.9%] and 50 male [58.1%] individuals) with clinically node-negative head and neck MCC, 69 (80.2%) underwent SLNB. Occult nodal disease was identified in 19 participants (27.5%). SLNB sensitivity was 52.6% (10 of 19 patients), NPV was 88.6% (31 of 35 patients), and FN rate was 26.7% (4 of 15 patients). SLNB failed in 29.0% (20 of 69 patients), with tumor location, female sex, and older age having medium to large effect on SLNB failure. Lymphovascular invasion, infiltrative growth pattern, and tumor size had the largest effect size on nodal disease with Cox analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large single-site cohort study, SLNB remained a useful tool in head and neck MCC, identifying more than half of occult nodal disease. Given reduced performance in this region, patients with failed SLNB or negative SLNB plus high-risk features may benefit from tailored management, including intensified therapy and surveillance.</description>

We aim to analyze OPHL in terms of oncologic and functional results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary care center. METHODS: All patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent open horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy (OHSL) and supracricoid partial laryngectomy (SCPL) between 2000 and 2020 at our institution were included. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were identified. 89% were male, with a mean age of 58 years old. Seventy had supraglottic tumors, while 42 had glottic tumors. OHSL was performed in 61 patients, while SCPL was in 51, of whom an arytenoid was resected in 9 patients and the epiglottis in 7. The series includes 30.4% T3-T4 classified tumors. Postoperative pneumonia appeared in 13.4% of patients. Decannulation was achieved in 93% of patients at a median of 14 days. The feeding tube was discontinued in 95% of patients at a median of 20 days. The mean follow-up was 91 months. The 5-year-LC rate was 90.2% in T1-T2 classified tumors and 80.9% in T3-T4 classified tumors. The 5-years-LEDFS was 72.1%. Total laryngectomy was performed in 14 patients: 11 following locoregional recurrence and the remaining 3 for functional reasons. Eleven patients maintained a tracheostomy or feeding tube for over 2 years. CONCLUSION: OPHL in selected patients with early and locally-advanced laryngeal tumors allows oncological results comparable to total laryngectomy while obtaining excellent stable functional results.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Online electronic survey. METHODS: An online survey was distributed via AHNS survey system. Participation was voluntary, and data were anonymously collected. RESULTS: 108 members (7.7% of AHNS members) responded. Most (65.7%) had ≥5 years of experience in the field. Few practitioners (23.2% always and 10.2% frequently) confirmed HPV-negative status with DNA/RNA in situ hybridization or PCR testing for p16-negative tumors. Most surgeons (60.2%) reported recommending TORS for identification of an unknown primary in a patient with p16-/HPV-negative neck mass. Similarly, at least half (56.5%) of surgeons indicated always or frequently treating resectable T1-T3 with TORS. The majority (73.2%) of surgeons indicated infrequently (59.3%) or never (13.9%) treating T3/T4 with traditional open surgery as first line. More than half of the surgeons (57.4%) believed survival is better with surgery compared to definitive nonsurgical therapy for HPV-negative OPSCC. There was wide variation in the use of treatment intensification (dual modality adjuvant treatment for T1-2N0, or tri-modality treatment for T1-T2N1), with 19.4% reporting never, 36.1% infrequently, 34.3% frequently, and 10.2% always doing so. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of AHNS surgeons (57.4%) believe survival for HPV-negative OPSCC is better with surgery. Most (56.5%) would treat resectable T1-T3 tumors with TORS, while the minority (26.8%) would frequently or always operate on T3-T4 tumors. There was wide variation in practice with respect to treatment intensifiication owing to remaining knowledge gaps in the field.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted in a high-volume, NCI-designated tertiary care setting. METHODS: Patients with HPV-negative OPSCC who underwent primary definitive TOS with risk-adapted adjuvant therapy (1998-2020) were identified. The primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative gastrostomy tube (G-tube) rates, tracheostomy rates, and functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) scores. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were treated with TOS for HPV-negative OPSCC. The majority of patients presented with late-stage disease (stage III/IV, 73%); 79% with early tumor stage (T1/T2) and 71% with positive nodal disease. Three-year estimates for OS and RFS for the entire cohort were 67.2% and 63.3% respectively. Advanced tumor stage predicted worsened OS [HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.75-5.95] and RFS [HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.13-5.01] on univariable analysis. Stage III/IV disease was associated with worsened OS [HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.01-4.63], but not RFS. Thirty-two patients (36%) recurred during the follow-up period; 19 (21%) failed locoregionally, and 13 (15%) failed distantly. Five patients (6%) were G-tube dependent and 3 patients (3%) were tracheostomy dependent at 1-year. CONCLUSION: Transoral surgery may be considered as a primary treatment in HPV-negative OPSCC with acceptable oncologic outcomes and the potential for improved functional outcomes.</description>

Diagnostic transoral robotic surgery (TORS) now routinely identifies occult primary tumors previously undetected by conventional methods. Here we analyze the histopathology of these tumors, demonstrating novel patterns of submucosal spread in predominantly microscopic tumors. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eighty patients with HPV-mediated hnSCCUP who underwent diagnostic TORS from 2013 to 2022, analyzing tumor histopathology and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Primary tumors were identified in 66 (83%) patients averaging 6 × 3 mm in diameter. These microscopic primaries produced cervical metastases over 6 times larger, with many exhibiting ribbon-like submucosal spread through lymphoepithelial crypts that evaded conventional detection. Almost all (98%) were T1 tumors; 71% measured &lt; 1 cm. At 38-month follow-up, 96% of patients remained alive without locoregional recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic TORS reveals that most HPV+ hnSCCUP are actually T1-microscopic oropharyngeal carcinomas, which might constitute a distinct clinical entity requiring new tailored treatment approaches.</description>

A subset is associated with high-risk HPV, but risk factors for HPV-associated sinonasal carcinoma (HPV-SNC) and HPV-independent disease remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate behavioral and clinical risk factors, including sexual history and substance use, and HPV antibody seropositivity in patients with HPV-SNC and HPV-independent SNC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multi-institutional case-case-control study was conducted from 2021 to 2024 at two NCI-designated cancer centers. Fifty-two patients with sinonasal carcinoma were enrolled; 37 completed a survey of demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors (24 HPV-SNC, 13 HPV-independent SNC) and serology was obtained for 36 (24 HPV-SNC, 12 HPV-independent SNC). Control noncancer otolaryngology patients (n = 148) from a recent prior study were matched 4:1. EXPOSURE: Self-reported history of sexual behaviors, substance use, and medical history via electronic survey; serum testing for antibodies to low- and high-risk HPV E6, E7, E1, E2, and L1 oncoproteins using a multiplex bead-based assay. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Odds of HPV-SNC or HPV-independent SNC diagnosis in relation to risk factors; differences in HPV seropositivity between groups. RESULTS: Among the 37 cancer patients who completed the survey, a history of tonsillectomy was significantly associated with reduced odds of HPV-SNC (OR 0.28, CI 0.09-0.86). No other factors explored (sexual behavior, substance use, or other clinical factors) were associated with HPV-associated SNC and HPV-independent SNC. Seroprevalence of anti-HPV16 E6 was significantly higher among HPV-associated SNC cases than either controls or HPV-independent SNC (45.8% vs. 0% and 13.1%), HPV-16 E6 (18.2% vs. 0% and 4.0%), and HPV-16 early proteins (16.7% vs. 0% and 0%) than HPV-independent SNC patients or controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: HPV-SNC exhibits distinct serologic features without clear behavioral risk factors. The protective association of tonsillectomy suggests lymphoid tissue may play a role in HPV-associated sinonasal oncogenesis. In contrast, the absence of identifiable risk factors for HPV-independent SNC highlights the need for further etiologic studies.</description>

This study uncovers the pivotal role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in driving ATC aggressiveness through mechanotransduction mediated by the Integrin α6β4/Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) axis. By engineering collagen-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable rigidity, we demonstrated that high ECM stiffness (60 kPa) markedly enhanced ATC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, stiff matrices induced cytoskeletal reorganization, activated RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, and upregulated Integrin α6β4-FAK pathway components, as validated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional assays. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK reversed stiffness-dependent tumor-promoting effects in vitro. In vivo, mice injected with tumor cells pre-cultured on high-stiffness ECM-mimicking hydrogels exhibited accelerated subcutaneous tumor growth and increased lung metastatic burden, which were significantly attenuated by FAK-targeted therapy. These findings establish ECM stiffness as a biomechanical determinant of ATC progression and metastasis, offering novel insights into microenvironment-driven malignancy and highlighting FAK as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt mechanosignaling in ATC.</description>

As immunotherapy has become the first-line treatment for HNSCC, resistance to anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents has emerged as a pivotal challenge. This prospective, single arm, phase II study (NCT05721443) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, combined with cetuximab in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Patients diagnosed with p16-negative R/M HNSCC resistant to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy without prior cetuximab treatment were enroled. Patients received oral dalpiciclib (150 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) and intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly in each cycle). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. Between March 2023 and November 2024, a total of 28 patients were enroled. The ORR was 67.9% (19/28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49.0%-82.0%), which met our primary endpoint. With a median follow-up of 9.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.98-14.12), the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.13- not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 10.75-23.25). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in all patients, predominantly grade 1-2. Grade 3 TRAEs included neutrophil count decreased (9/28, 32.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (9/28, 32.1%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. Dalpiciclib combined with cetuximab was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.</description>

We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

Whether the same prognostic significance holds with surgical treatment such as transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is less well studied. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary care academic center. METHODS: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC treated with TORS from January 2016 to December 2023 were included. Demographics, smoking history, disease characteristics, treatment, and oncologic outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 156 patients were included. 87.2% were male with median age 60.0 years. Seventy-seven were never smokers, 63 former smokers, and 16 current smokers, with a median 20 pack-years among ever smokers. Three local, 6 regional, and ten distant metastases were identified, with 6 deaths, over a median 2.2 years of follow up. When comparing never, former, and current smokers, ever smokers demonstrated more advanced pathologic nodal staging (P = .03) and extranodal extension (P = .05). When comparing never and ever smokers, never smokers were younger (P = .04), and primary site differed with borderline significance (P = .05). Ever smokers again had more advanced nodal stage (P = .01) and extranodal extension (P = .02). There were no significant differences in adjuvant treatment, disease recurrence, or death by smoking history. There were no significant differences apart from age when analyzed using a 10 or 20-pack-year smoking history cutoff (P = .01, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Smoking history is associated with more advanced nodal stage and extranodal extension. However, smoking does not appear to influence recurrence or death in the setting of HPV-associated OPSCC definitively treated with TORS.</description>

Despite curative-intent therapy, 10% to 50% of patients experience recurrence. Prognosis for recurrent or metastatic disease is poor, with limited treatment options, underscoring the need for accurate prognostic models to guide treatment escalation or de-escalation and avoid over-treatment. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prognostic study of patients undergoing curative-intent surgery at Samsung Medical Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary/Massachusetts General Hospital from 2008 to 2024. Baseline clinicopathologic variables were integrated with longitudinal laboratory measurements from surveillance. A random 80/20 split defined development and internal-validation cohorts. Using XGBoost, we trained two models to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from each visit. RESULTS: A total of 975 patients with HNSCC (oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal subsites) were included. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year RFS from the surveillance time point were 0.785 (sensitivity, 72.8%; specificity, 71.5%), 0.831 (79.7%; 73.7%), 0.788 (74.0%; 73.3%), 0.769 (72.6%; 70.5%), and 0.795 (72.1%; 74.7%), respectively. For OS prediction, AUCs were 0.788 (72.1%; 73.6%), 0.797 (75.7%; 71.8%), 0.796 (81.0%; 68.4%), 0.820 (77.5%; 76.5%), and 0.815 (75.8%; 75.8%), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the model showed strong OS prediction in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, with AUCs of 0.943, 0.736, 0.699, 0.835, and 0.765 at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years, respectively. In non-HPV-positive HNSCC, OS AUCs ranged from 0.780 to 0.813 and RFS AUCs from 0.774 to 0.830 across the same time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model using multimodal and longitudinal data accurately predicted RFS and OS at multiple time points following curative-intent surgery for HNSCC.</description>

This prospective cohort study aimed to describe the longitudinal changes in swallowing and oral intake and assess the influence of adjuvant treatment modalities. We included 89 patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Swallowing was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery using Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), Swallowing Ability and Safety Scale (SASS), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Patients were stratified by adjuvant treatment: none, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy. Swallowing recovery was dynamic. EAT-10 scores increased from 8.8 at 1 month to peak at 13.5 at 3 months (p &lt; 0.001), before decreasing to 8.3 at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). Penetration/aspiration for thin liquids significantly increased from 32.6% at 1 month to 44.9% at 3 months (p = 0.034), then decreased to 31.5% at 6 months (p = 0.014). FOIS and SASS scores showed overall improvement from 1 to 6 months (p &lt; 0.001 for both), despite a transient dip in FOIS and a rise in poor SASS scores at 3 months. Patients receiving chemoradiotherapy demonstrated greater perceived dysphagia, lower functional oral intake, and higher rates of thin liquid penetration/aspiration compared to other groups across all time points. In conclusion, chemoradiotherapy is associated with more severe and prolonged dysphagia. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted rehabilitation and comprehensive multidisciplinary care.</description>

Previous work revealed reduced proportions and cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in ATC tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we investigated the role of super-enhancers (SEs), clusters of adjacent enhancers and drive high expression of genes, in reshaping the TME in ATC. Comprehensive profiling of the SE landscapes in ATC revealed activation of oncogenic SEs as a mechanism underlying the dedifferentiation and anaplastic transformation of thyroid cancer. An SE signature based on recurrent SEs in ATC was associated with significantly shortened overall patient survival. FOSL1 was identified as an SE-driven transcriptional factor that was crucial for epigenetic remodeling of ATC cells. Interestingly, FOSL1 bound to its own SE, promoted chromatin looping and spatial proximity of the distal SE with its promoter, and maintained its high expression, forming a positive feedback self-regulation circuit. During ATC progression, FOSL1 boosted expression of metalloproteinases ADAM9 and MMP14 via binding to their SEs, which promoted MICA shedding from the cell surface and led to subsequent immune escape from NK cell killing. Silencing FOSL1, ADAM9, or MMP9 sensitized ATC cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and suppressed ATC growth in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the role of FOSL1 in chromatin remodeling of ATC and in dampening cytotoxic functions of NK cells, thereby providing insights into the development of potential cancer therapeutics.</description>

To gain insight into biological mechanisms that cause DNA damage resistance and to inform strategies for achieving synergy with therapeutic radiation, we performed parallel pooled genetic CRISPR-Cas9 screening for survival in high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subtypes. Surprisingly, in addition to known mediators of radiotherapy response, including ATM, DNAPK, and NF-κB signaling, loss of JAK1 was identified as a driver of tumor cell radioresistance. Knockout of JAK1 in HNSCC increased cell survival by enhancing the DNA damage-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and delaying progression to radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe. In line with this finding, both JAK1 knockout and kinase inhibition with abrocitinib prevented subsequent formation of radiation-induced micronuclei. Loss of JAK1 function did not affect canonical CDK1 signaling but instead reduced activation of PLK1 and AURKA, two kinases with auxiliary roles in the regulation of G2 and M phase progression. Correspondingly, using both EdU labelling and live cell imaging techniques, JAK1 loss was found to cause prolonged metaphase, mitotic slippage, and progression to tetraploidy. Targeting the mitotic kinesin KIF18A with the small molecule sovilnesib exacerbated mitotic stress and enhanced the efficacy of radiation. These studies establish KIF18A inhibition as a strategy to counteract the protective G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and to thus enhance tumor cell sensitivity to radiation therapy.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 578 patients with early-stage OSCC (cT1-3N0) who underwent US-FNAC prior to surgery. Histopathology, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and follow-up were used as reference standards. RESULTS: Occult nodal metastases were found in 179 patients (31.0%). US-FNAC showed low sensitivity (15.9%) and a negative predictive value of 72.9%, resulting in 149 false-negative cases (25.8%). Specificity (99.5%) and positive predictive value (90.3%) were high, with only 2 false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and a clinically negative neck, US-FNAC demonstrates high specificity but limited sensitivity and negative predictive value. These findings indicate that US-FNAC alone is insufficient to exclude occult nodal metastases and should be regarded as an adjunctive diagnostic tool rather than a stand-alone nodal staging strategy.</description>

This study aims to explore the optimal extent of LND and discover a personalized and accurate surgical plan for pN1 PTC patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 550 patients with PTC who underwent initial surgery. For patients who were considered pN1a, LND of levels III and IV was completed. For patients who were considered LNM in levels III or IV, after taking 3-6 lymph nodes of level III for frozen pathological examination, if LNM was found, LND of levels II-IV was performed; otherwise, only levels III and IV were dissected, For patients who were considered to have LNM in level II, LND of levels II-V was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: 51.4% of patients with pN1a had postoperative pathologically confirmed occult LNM in levels III and IV. Among patients who underwent LND of levels II-IV due to positive lymph nodes in level III, 46.1% had occult LNM in level II. For patients with LNM in level II, the incidence of occult metastasis in level V was 20%. Only one patient presented with lymph node recurrence outside of the operative field. The proportion of patients with postoperative complications increased as the scope of dissection enlarged. CONCLUSION: Combined with the distribution of LNM and the number of subregions of LNM(n) in preoperative ultrasonography, it is suggested that the range of LND in the lateral neck of pN1 PTC should be n + 1/2 anatomical subregions.</description>

METHOD: In this retrospective diagnostic study, 310 patients with pathologically confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma from two hospitals were included. We trained ViT models for B-mode and SMI, then extracted ViT and radiomics features from their video images. Initially, Single-modality models were developed, including the B-mode radiomics model (BMUS_RAD) and the B-mode ViT model (BMUS_ViT). Subsequently, Dual-modality models were constructed, encompassing the Dual-modality radiomics model (DMU_RAD), the Dual-modality ViT model (DMU_ViT), and finally, the integrated model DMU_RAD_ViT, to enhance the prediction of CLNM. The performance of each model was compared, and SHAP was utilized for the visual interpretation of the novel fusion model. RESULTS: Among all the models, the fusion model DMU_RAD_ViT performed the best (AUC = 0.901, p &lt; 0.05). At the same time, the dual-modality model DMU_RAD(AUC = 0.856) and DMU_ViT(AUC = 0.832) is also higher than the single-modal model BMUS_RAD (AUC = 0.837) and BMUS_ViT (AUC = 0.789), respectively. SHAP analysis revealed that 16 radiomics and ViT features from both modalities contributed to the DMU_RAD_ViT model. CONCLUSIONS: The Dual-modality fusion model, integrating both radiomics and ViT features, can be utilized to predict CLNM.</description>

This includes cancers of the lip, oral cavitiy, pharynx (epi-, oro- and hypopharynx), larynx, nasal cavity/ sinus and salivary gland. Additionally, they are associated with functional impairments that place highly specific demands on treating practitioners. Since the introduction of the German National Cancer Plan in 2008, cancer treatment has been aligned with the latest scientific findings through evidence-based guidelines. Meanwhile, treatment courses and outcomes have been systematically recorded by expanding the German cancer registry. In addition, the certification of treatment centers aims to ensure consistently high-quality care. Given the considerable investment of time, personnel, and financial resources required for certification, the question arises whether patients with head and neck cancer benefit from receiving (initial) treatment at a certified center compared to a non-certified facility. METHODS: We used patient-specific information from statutory health insurance (SHI) and clinical cancer registry (CCR) data for the period 2009–2017 as well as hospital characteristics from standardized quality reports. We applied multivariable Cox regressions to analyze differences in survival between patients treated in hospitals with and without German Cancer Society (DKG) certification. RESULTS: The sample comprised 52,749 (SHI) and 15,287 (CCR) patients with head and neck cancer who were treated in 872 hospitals (44 DKG-certified, 828 not DKG-certified). 15.5% (SHI) and 25.9% (CCR) of patients were (initially) treated in DKG-certified cancer centers. Cox regression analysis for overall survival showed that patients treated in DKG-certified cancer centers were at significantly lower risk of death (SHI data: HR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.89–1.00, p = 0.043; CCR data: HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.83–0.95, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, the difference was even more pronounced for recurrence-free survival (CCR data: HR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72–0.92, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although achieving certification requires a substantial investment of personnel, time, and financial resources by the treating institution, it is associated with a measurable survival advantage for patients. Therefore, treatment of head and neck cancer patients should preferably be provided at certified head and neck cancer centers.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: 2019 Patient User File of the National Cancer Database. METHODS: Patients &gt;18 years of age with OPC were stratified based on margin status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical variables associated with PM. Survival analyses were performed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and hazard ratios (aHRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. RESULTS: In total, 4294 patients met the criteria. The PM rate was 16.6%. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa), salivary gland carcinoma, clinical T category, base of tongue primary site, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with PM. PMs were associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.40-1.99). In patients with PM, but without extranodal extension (ENE), adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) (aHR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (aCRT) (aHR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45) were associated with an improvement in OS versus surgery alone; however, OS between aRT and aCRT was similar for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCa. CONCLUSION: Histologic type, clinical T category, tumor subsite, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with TORS PM. aCRT did not confer a survival benefit over aRT in the overall cohort, or in subgroups of HPV-associated or HPV-negative SCCa patients with PM without ENE.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Retrospective nationwide database review. METHODS: Genomic data from 130 OCA samples, representing 124 adult patients, were retrieved from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics, Evidence, and Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) database (v17.0-public). Analysis focused on nonsynonymous somatic mutations identified via whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted panel sequencing after standardized filtering. Mutation frequencies, enrichment based on gender and metastatic status (primary vs. metastatic), and patterns of co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequently mutated genes were TERT (33.1%, predominantly promoter mutations), TP53 (20.0%), DAXX (16.2%), KMT2D (13.1%), NF1 (12.3%), and PTEN (10.0%). Significant gender-specific enrichment was identified, notably MST1R mutations exclusive to females (10.7%) and PRKDC mutations exclusive to males (16.7%). Mutations in PC, PCLO, MEN1, and TSC2 were significantly enriched in metastatic samples. DAXX and CDKN1A mutations exhibited significant co-occurrence, whereas TERT mutations were mutually exclusive with DAXX alterations. CONCLUSION: The genomic landscape of OCA is marked by frequent TERT promoter mutations and distinct mutational patterns associated with patient gender and tumor metastatic status. These findings highlight potential molecular subtypes, reveal pathways potentially driving metastasis (eg, involving MEN1/TSC2), and identify novel sex-specific alterations (MST1R, PRKDC), offering avenues for improved development of targeted therapeutic strategies for OCA.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-metastatic NPC patients treated between 2017 and 2018 were screened. MRI data were reviewed for re-staging according to the TNM-9 and iENE status per the HNCIG-criteria. Five-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) based on the ordinal N category of TNM-9 and the G2 iENE status were performed to propose a refined N category. RESULTS: Totally, 1334 patients were included, with 462 (34.6%) patients presenting with G2 iENE at baseline. Besides N Category, G2 iENE also showed independent prognostic value for OS (HR: 1.453, P = 0.042), PFS (HR: 1.293, P = 0.057) and DMFS (HR: 1.363, P = 0.042). The RPA-N category was then derived: RPA-N0 (N0), RPA-N1 (N1 without G2 iENE), RPA-N2 (N1 with G2 iENE and N2) and RPA-N3 (N3). The RPA-N classification had a lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) and higher C-index for all endpoints, and performed better in hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, sample size balance and outcome prediction when compared to TNM-9. CONCLUSIONS: G2 iENE, based on the HNCIG-criteria, constitute an independent adverse prognostic factor for NPC based on the TNM-9. The RPA-N category, which integrated N category of TNM-9 and G2 iENE, demonstrated better performance than N category in TNM-9, further validation in multicenter cohorts is warranted.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 500 NPC patients from four hospitals were allocated to training (n = 274), internal testing (n = 118), and external testing cohorts (n = 108). Rad features were extracted from MRI-defined carotid artery regions of interest, SRad features from K-means-derived subregions, and deep features from a SwinT backbone. Single-source and fusion models were developed. Discrimination (AUC), classification (ACC/SEN/SPE), calibration (Brier score and calibration curves), reclassification (NRI/IDI), and interpretability (SHAP) were assessed. RESULTS: RICAI was observed in 48.5%, 48.3%, and 54.6% of the training, internal testing, and external testing cohorts, respectively. Among single-source models, SwinT and SRad showed comparable performance, with Rad slightly inferior; all outperformed the clinical model. The fused Rad-SRad-SwinT achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.737-0.891) in internal testing and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.794-0.932) in external testing, alongside favorable classification in external testing (ACC 0.815, SEN 0.763, SPE 0.878) and good calibration (Brier score 0.148). NRI/IDI analyses indicated significantly improved reclassification versus single-source models. SHAP analyses demonstrated that SwinT-derived features contributed most to model decisions, followed by SRad and Rad, supporting complementary gains from deep semantic representation and subregional heterogeneity quantification. CONCLUSION: Integrating multilevel radiomics with Transformer-derived deep learning features enhances prediction of RICAI after NPC radiotherapy and shows promise as a noninvasive risk-stratification tool.</description>

Quantitative imaging may provide scalable biomarkers to individualise care. Quantitative imaging can support baseline risk stratification, early on-treatment decision-making, and posttreatment surveillance in HPV-positive OPSCC. Real-world translation requires standardised reporting, calibration/harmonisation across centres, rigorous model validation, and workflow integration with radiotherapy planning. Quantitative MRI, CT, and PET, augmented by radiomics and AI, show convergent promise as non-invasive biomarkers to enable safe individualisation of therapy in HPV-positive OPSCC, contingent on methodological rigour and prospective, externally validated studies. Despite this promise, clinical translation faces substantial barriers, including limited external validation, heterogeneous methodologies, and the need for standardised, prospectively validated pipelines.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kwan D, Kwan W, Badwal A, Puol T, Deng JZ, Wang R, Ahmed S, Mansfield A, Fazelzad R, Jones J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18020286'&gt;10.3390/cancers18020286&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41595205/'&gt;41595205&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purpose: The effectiveness and feasibility of cancer prehabilitation have been well-validated in surgical settings, but its role in non-surgical treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), remains unclear. This scoping review aims to systematically explore the existing literature on prehabilitation programs for non-surgical cancer treatments. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were systematically searched from their inception to October 2024 for peer-reviewed studies involving prehabilitation prior to non-surgical treatment. Data were extracted and reported adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, using a convergent synthesis design to present qualitative and quantitative evidence. No formal risk-of-bias or quality appraisal was conducted. Results: Of 22,122 studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, yielding a combined sample of 6073 patients and thirty-four unique interventions. Sample sizes ranged from 9 to 1992, with randomized control trials being the most common (16). Head and neck cancer was the most frequently studied, followed by breast, esophageal/gastric, and lung cancer. Of the included interventions, 23 were unimodal and 16 were multimodal. Exercise was the most common component (30), with nutrition (13), psychosocial (10), and educational (8) components also present. Most efficacy studies (84%) reported improved outcomes and nearly all (93%) feasibility studies found prehabilitation acceptable and implementable. Conclusions: This review highlights a growing body of literature examining prehabilitation prior to chemotherapy or RT in adult cancer patients, with studies suggesting potential benefits and feasibility. However, long-term trials, especially in diverse cancers and older populations, remain scarce. Our results provide insight into future implementation, evaluation of outcomes, and directions for future prehabilitation research.</description>

Dutch guidelines recommend a care pathway interval (CPI) of a maximum of 30 days, and a free bone margin of at least 5 mm. Fused MRI and CT data are used for accurate tumor delineation. Based on this data, a virtual surgical plan is created and transferred to the operating room using resection guides and patient-specific implants (PSIs). Long-term evaluation is needed to further optimize its clinical use. Objectives: This study evaluates adherence to bone margin and CPI guidelines in mandibular OSCC. Additionally, it assesses the accuracy of tumor resection and reconstruction using 3D-VSP and compares the complications of 3D-planned mandibular reconstruction using different kinds of osteosynthesis plates. Methods: All patients who underwent a segmental mandibulectomy between 2014 and 2024 at the University Medical Center Groningen were included. CPI, clinical outcomes, and complications were analyzed. The preoperative virtual plan was compared with the postoperative outcome to assess accuracy. Results: The median CPI was 34 days, and 93.7% of bone margins were tumor-free. Mean absolute resection deviation was 1.63 mm (±1.42). PSI reconstructions were significantly more accurate in intergonial distance and coronal angle compared to conventional plates. Plate-related complications were more common in non-bony reconstructions; PSI reconstructions showed significantly more plate exposure. Conclusions: 3D-VSP leads to high accuracy in resection and reconstruction and favorable bone margins. Shortening the CPI and reducing biological complications are essential to further improve oncological outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the methylation status, functional effects, and underlying mechanisms of BCAR3 in TC. METHODS: BCAR3 methylation was analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in 422 TC and 371 benign thyroid nodule samples. Expression levels were assessed via immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blot. Functional assays including proliferation, migration, and invasion were performed after BCAR3 knockdown. Rescue experiments using a PI3K activator were conducted to examine pathway mechanisms. RESULTS: BCAR3 was significantly hypomethylated in TC compared to benign tissues (p &lt; 0.001), with CpG_6 most strongly associated with TC risk (odds ratio, OR = 1.73, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, BCAR3 hypomethylation was more pronounced in cases with larger tumor size and advanced disease stage. Furthermore, BCAR3 methylation showed differential patterns across TC subtypes, with medullary thyroid carcinoma exhibiting the lowest methylation levels. BCAR3 expression was upregulated in TC tissues and cell lines (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, BCAR3 knockdown reduced phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR and altered expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, characterized by an increase in E-cadherin and decreases in Vimentin and N-cadherin, and consequently suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion (p &lt; 0.05). Rescue experiments with a PI3K activator showed a trend towards restoration of these effects, although not to the level of the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: BCAR3 hypomethylation contributes to TC cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion by promoting AKT/mTOR activation and EMT. These findings highlight the potential of BCAR3 methylation as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in TC.</description>

Dendritic cells, major regulators of specific anti-tumor immune response, are often impaired in their function in the context of cancer. METHODS: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were incubated with isolated small extracellular vesicles during or after maturation. Cell surface markers and antigen processing machinery were assessed by flow cytometry. Vesicle-treated dendritic cells were tested for interleukin 12p70 production by ELISA, and differences in uptake of labeled vesicles were shown by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Small extracellular vesicles derived from HPV(+) tumor cell lines increased maturation and activation of immature dendritic cells, priming them for more rapid phagocytosis. Immature dendritic cells co-incubated with vesicles had lower levels of antigen presenting machinery components and produced less IL12p70 than controls, while similarly co-incubated mature dendritic cells remained unaffected. Vesicles in plasma of patients with head and neck cancer inhibited functions of mature dendritic cells by downregulating expression of antigen presenting machinery components. CONCLUSION: Our results uncover mechanisms through which tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles modulate dendritic cell functions locally and systemically. These mechanisms may also affect dendritic cell-based vaccine efficacy.</description>

However, limited research has investigated the trends in the burden of thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI. METHODS: This study utilized data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2021) study. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to compute the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in age-standardized disability-adjusted life year (DALY) rates (ASDR) and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR). An age-period-cohort (APC) model was used to analyze the effects of age, period, and birth cohort on the burden of thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI. The ARIMA model was applied to predict the global and national disease burden from 2022 to 2031. RESULTS: In 2021, the rates of change in DALY number, crude DALY rate, ASDR, death number, and crude death rate for thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI in China exceeded the corresponding global rates compared to 1990. From 1990 to 2021, the global burden of thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI was higher in women than in men, whereas in China, the burden was higher in men than in women from 2010 to 2021. The peak burden occurred in middle-aged populations, with the burden increasing with age. From 1990 to 2021, the ASDR and ASMR for thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI showed an upward trend globally and in China. Projections indicate that the burden will continue to rise from 2022 to 2031. CONCLUSION: From 1990 to 2021, the ASDR and ASMR for thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI exhibited an increasing trend globally and in China. The burden was higher in women than in men globally, but in China, it was higher in men than in women from 2010 to 2021. The burden increased with age. Projections suggest that the burden of thyroid cancer attributable to high BMI will continue to rise from 2022 to 2031.</description>

In thyroid surgery, patient communication can be complicated by the complex anatomy and variable surgical approaches, which may not be fully conveyed through conventional verbal explanations or schematic drawings. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) thyroid models may provide an intuitive tool to enhance patient comprehension. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at Peking Union Medical College Hospital with 94 newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer patients scheduled for thyroidectomy. Participants were assigned to either the control group (n = 47), which received preoperative drawing-based counseling, or the intervention group (n = 47), which utilized a virtual 3D model for communication. The Thyroid Navigator app, developed by Kuma Hospital, was used to provide dynamic 3D representation of the thyroid gland, surrounding structures, and potential surgical procedures. After standardized preoperative consultations, patients were surveyed to assess their understanding in pertinent anatomy and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Patients in the 3D model group demonstrated similar correct response rates in lesion localization (p = 0.536) or parathyroid gland recognition (p = 0.071), but significantly higher accuracy in identifying the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the extent of lymph node dissection compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, comprehension of the causes of major postoperative complications-including hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, p = 0.004), hypocalcemia (parathyroid gland impairment, p = 0.015), and bleeding (inadequate hemostasis, p = 0.008)-was significantly improved in the 3D model group. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a virtual 3D thyroid model significantly improves patient comprehension of thyroid anatomy, surgical procedures, and potential complications, thereby enhancing clinician-patient communication. Virtual 3D models represent a practical and cost-effective supplement to conventional counseling in thyroid surgery, offering clear benefits in patient education and shared decision-making.</description>

In this study, we compared TORT and TOETVA in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Methods: From September 2016 to January 2022, we retrospectively compared patient characteristics and clinical features from 100 TORT cases and 300 TOETVA cases, as well as their respective learning curves. Results: Median operation time of TORT was 80.4 min, similar to TOETVA (81.4 min, p = 0.719). Median docking time of TORT was 4.51 min and median console time was 27.72 min. The length of stay of TORT and TOETVA was 2.29 and 2.54 (p = 0.002). The median number of retrieved central lymph nodes for TOETVA and TORT were 2.89 and 2.99 (p = 0.746). Discussion: There was no significant difference with clinical features between TORT and TOETVA.</description>

We aim to systematically review the literature on radiomics in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, assessing applications in tumour staging, prognosis, recurrence prediction, and treatment response evaluation. PROSPERO ID: CRD420251117983. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in May 2025. INCLUSION CRITERIA: studies published between 1 January 2010 and 31 January 2024, extracted radiomic features from CT, PET/CT, or MRI, and analysed outcomes related to diagnosis, staging, survival, recurrence, or treatment response in laryngeal cancer. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: case reports, abstracts, editorials, reviews, or conference proceedings, exclusive focus on preclinical or animal models, lack of a clear radiomics methodology, or did not include imaging-based feature extraction. Results were synthesised narratively by modelling objective, alongside formal assessment of methodological quality using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Results: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria, with most using CT-based radiomics. Seven incorporated PET/CT. Radiomic models demonstrated moderate-to-high accuracy across tasks including T-staging, thyroid cartilage invasion, survival prediction, and local failure. Key predictive features included first-order entropy, skewness, and texture metrics such as size zone non-uniformity and GLCM correlation. Methodological variability, limited external validation, and small samples were frequent limitations. Conclusions: Radiomics holds strong promise as a non-invasive biomarker for laryngeal cancer. However, methodological heterogeneity identified through formal quality assessment indicates that improved standardisation, reproducibility, and multicentre validation are required before widespread clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang C, Hu J, Li X, Cai Y, Wang S, Wu X, Liu H, Hu Z, Hu D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1676360'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1676360&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41607540/'&gt;41607540&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Preoperative ambiguous thyroid nodules often depend on intraoperative frozen sections for surgical planning, but misdiagnosis can occur due to low-quality frozen sections, limited diagnostic time, and a shortage of pathologists. Deep learning models and conventional radiomics have shown potential in improving diagnostic accuracy in thyroid nodules, yet their integration remains under-explored. This study aimed to develop deep-learning-based models to assist in the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of thyroid nodules by classifying benign/malignant cases, predicting BRAFV600E gene mutation, and identifying lymph node metastasis. METHODS: A total of 436 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) of thyroid frozen sections were analyzed using deep learning techniques. The analysis included image preprocessing, feature extraction, and classifier training. Patch-to-WSI feature aggregation was done via Patch Likelihood Histogram (PLH) and Bag of Words (BoW) methods. RESULTS: On the test set, the InceptionV3 model performed best in benign/malignant classification with an AUC of 0.998 and accuracy of 0.988, where weakly supervised strategies surpassed supervised ones. For BRAFV600E gene mutation prediction, the ResNet50 model achieved a patch-level AUC of 0.831 and a WSI-level accuracy of 94.4% under the extended strategy. A ViT-based model for lymph node metastasis prediction obtained an AUC of 0.671 and accuracy of 76%. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that deep learning models can effectively classify benign/malignant thyroid frozen sections, predict BRAFV600E gene mutations, and predict lymph node metastasis status. It also emphasizes the effectiveness of weakly supervised strategies in thyroid lesion frozen sections, which could lessen reliance on pathologists' annotations.</description>

Tumor-associated plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have gained increasing attention as an important regulatory TME component for tumor progression and immune evasion. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of plasma-derived sEVs from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in the systemic regulation of hypoxia-related molecular pathways in circulating immune cells. Plasma-derived sEVs of healthy donors (HDs) and HNSCC patients were isolated and evaluated for morphology, size, miRNA cargo composition, and their influence on monocyte characteristics. Transfer of plasma-derived sEVs from HNSCC patients stimulated increased levels of checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and chemokine CXCL4 secretion. An accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α was associated with hypoxia-regulating miRNAs in sEVs from HNSCC patients. This provides new insights into a proposed tumor-associated systemic sEV-miRNA-mediated hypoxia transfer.</description>

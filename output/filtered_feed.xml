This prospective analysis included 35 patients with biopsy-proven hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who received platinum-based chemoradiotherapy and underwent pretreatment FDG PET/CT and interim FDG PET/CT (iPET) at a cumulative RT doses of 36.0-45.0 Gy. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor (PT) and combined total lymph nodes for both pre-PET and iPET were analyzed, and their percentage reductions in iPET were calculated. The optimal cutoff values of the metabolic parameters were derived from receiver operating characteristic curves. The outcomes were compared between patients with metabolic parameters above and below the respective cutoff values. Disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) was defined as a biopsy-proven tumor or unequivocal clinical and radiological evidence of progression. Twelve (34%) patients experienced disease recurrence during a median follow-up of 52 months. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the reduction ratio of the SUVmax of the PT (ΔSUVp; hazard ratio, 7.685; p = 0.008) was a significant predictor of disease recurrence. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that a smaller ΔSUVp was associated with worse progression-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.002). Metabolic parameters measured using iPET may be useful predictors of disease recurrence in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy. In this study, ΔSUVp was the best prognostic indicator.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ghani A, Ayesh AR, Rajaram H, Ganegoda SM, Alogakos M, Sato A, Hage K, Than CA, Nakanishi H, Shin J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642589/'&gt;41642589&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: A greater proportion of older patients (age ≥65 years) are undergoing thyroidectomy amidst an aging population. Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance. These findings support individualized counseling and perioperative planning while acknowledging the overall safety of thyroidectomy in this population.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chu F, Benzi P, Tagliabue M, Mossinelli C, Zorzi SF, Gandini S, Romelli M, Filauro M, Iandelli A, Marchi F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107852'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107852&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41643539/'&gt;41643539&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Head and neck cancers are the seventh most common malignancy worldwide, with laryngeal cancer (LC) the most prevalent subtype. Although squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents 85-90% of LC, rare non-SCC tumors-including laryngeal sarcomas (LS), neuroendocrine carcinomas (LNC), malignant salivary gland tumors (LMSGT), and mucosal melanomas (LMM)-are uncommon but clinically challenging. We combined a bicentric retrospective cohort with a systematic literature review to provide an integrated assessment of these entities. METHODS: Patients with non-SCC malignant laryngeal tumors treated with curative intent at two Italian tertiary centers were retrospectively analyzed. Tumors were classified as LS, LNC, LMSGT, or LMM. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A systematic review contextualized institutional outcomes. RESULTS: 74 patients were included: 34 LS, 25 LNC, 13 LMSGT, and 2 LMM. Surgery was the primary treatment in 98.6 % of cases. LS and LMSGT demonstrated favorable survival, whereas LNC showed poor outcomes (median OS, 2.89 years) and the highest recurrence rate (72 %). Radical tumor excision achieved effective loco-regional control across histologies. LMM prognosis was dismal, with recurrence in both cases. The literature review revealed marked heterogeneity and wide survival ranges, reflecting rarity and biological diversity. CONCLUSION: Rare non-SCC laryngeal tumors comprise heterogeneous and often aggressive diseases with variable prognoses. Despite the absence of standardized management, radical surgery provides effective loco-regional control. Integrating bicentric clinical experience with published evidence highlights the need for multicenter collaboration to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this rare oncologic setting worldwide today.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Curry T, Wener E, Odell M, Caulley L, Ramchandani R, Grant A, Thavorn K, Lasso A, Kilty S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70410'&gt;10.1002/lary.70410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41636338/'&gt;41636338&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of information on the uptake of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Our study reports the prevalence, disease characteristics, and nature of the desire for MAiD in patients with HNC who underwent the process in Ontario. The aim is to better understand this population and identify gaps in our current system of care. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis for the period June 17, 2016 to December 31, 2022. Data were received from the Office of the Chief Coroner Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-six persons received MAiD. The average age was 72.4 years (SD 12.22) with 260 of the patients being men (73.03%). The most common HNC primary tumor site was the oral cavity 109 (30.6%). The most reported reason was inadequate control of symptoms other than pain (79.21%) followed by inadequate pain control or concerns about it (75%). The patient's private residence (55.62%) was the most common setting. Patients were more likely to live in wealthier neighborhoods and in large urban centers. Future prediction of MAiD uptake shows a linear year-by-year increase. CONCLUSION: The use of MAiD in HNC has been steadily increasing since its legalization and is projected to continue increasing. There is a male predominance that is aligned with the incidence and prevalence of HNC nationally. Overall, MAiD is an increasingly employed choice for HNC patients receiving treatment for disease without curative intent.</description>

Our goal was to perform a large multicentre evaluation of WPOI as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective pathology data was collated from 14 institutions and compared with clinical outcome in 1374 OSCC patients with upfront curative resection. Most cases were of oral tongue (n = 645, 47%); T2 (33%) and N0 (59%). WPOI 1-3 frequency was 29.4%, WPOI 4 47% and WPOI 5 22%. On univariable analysis, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) was 54.2% for WPOI 5 vs. 69.7% for WPOI 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001). The locoregional control (LRC) was 68.9% vs 79.2% (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) 68.4% vs 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression in the entire cohort, WPOI 4 or 5 was strongly correlated with other known poor prognostic factors and not an independent predictor of OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.52), LRC or DFS. However, in early-stage (pT1-2 N0) patients treated with surgery alone without adjuvant radiotherapy, WPOI 5 was a robust independent predictor of DFS (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.54-12.32, p = 0.006), OS (HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.1, p = 0.020) and LRC (HR 3.52, 95% CI 2.13-5.82, p &lt;0.001) after applying inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. Furthermore, in the entire cohort of early-stage patients, interaction modeling showed that adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces the risk for both DFS and LRC for those with WPOI-5 (Interaction p = 0.002). Therefore, it may act as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. The prognostic and predictive role of WPOI-5 should be validated in prospective trials.</description>

We reviewed the evidence in the literature on the role of Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Controlling Nutritional Status Score (CONUT), and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) in predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in thyroid cancer. METHODS: Two reviewers searched CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases till 24th August 2025 for relevant publications. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible. Combined results demonstrated that elevated SII was slightly but significantly correlated with increased risk of LNM (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01; I² = 93%). Results failed to change in the sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analysis based on location and histology indicated non-significant results while meta-regression did not identify any significant moderators. Pooled analysis indicated no significant association between low PNI and DFS (HR: 1.45 95% CI: 0.97, 2.18 I2 = 80%) and LNM (HR: 1.31 95% CI: 0.89, 1.92 I2 = 73%) in thyroid cancer patients. Meta-analysis also showed that high CONUT was associated with a tendency of worse DFS in thyroid cancer, but results were non-significant (HR: 3.25 95% CI: 0.99, 10.69 I2 = 86%). However, meta-analysis showed that high CONUT was significantly associated with worse OS (HR: 9.67 95% CI: 1.90, 49.25 I2 = 61%). CONCLUSIONS: Limited data suggest that high SII may be marginally associated with increased risk of LNM in thyroid cancer, the clinical significance of which is questionable. PNI was not found to be associated with LNM or DFS in thyroid cancer patients. High CONUT was associated with poor OS and a non-significant tendency for worse DFS in thyroid cancer.</description>

Early detection of recurrence is critical, yet effective surveillance methods are limited. This study aims to evaluate the utility of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples for identifying recurrent NPC. A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included. EBV DNA levels in both nasopharyngeal brush and plasma samples were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. Head and neck MRI, sinus endoscopy examination, and biopsy of suspicious lesions were used as the gold standard to confirm recurrence. Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls. Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%). The positive predictive value was similar between methods, whereas the negative predictive value was markedly higher for the nasopharyngeal brush group (97.3% vs. 80.7%). These findings suggest that EBV DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples is a highly sensitive and minimally invasive supplementary tool for monitoring NPC recurrence. This approach offers superior sensitivity and an improved negative predictive value compared to plasma EBV DNA testing, and may enhance early surveillance and clinical management of NPC recurrence.</description>

The management of non-metastatic, locoregionally recurrent or second primary cancers is a complex multidisciplinary challenge that often occurs without guidance from robust clinical trials. In 2023, the NRG Oncology cooperative group created the Recurrent and Metastatic Working Group with the express directive to investigate how resources could optimally address the key questions for the recurrent and metastatic populations. Here, we present our view of the state of the science and present considerations for future investigations.</description>

While the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led the way to a new era of treatment possibilities, the current state-of-the-science calls for further innovation and a nuanced approach to clinical trial design to address a number of unmet needs. This white paper from the NRG Oncology Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Working Group aims to critically identify gaps in clinical practice and the scientific literature and to propose actionable recommendations for future research in the framework of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</description>

Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00649-7'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00649-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41643696/'&gt;41643696&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is minimal evidence supporting the use of early clinical endpoints to evaluate the activity of initial treatment in human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer in the context of contemporary therapeutic approaches. The aim of this study was to assess progression-free status at 24 months as a potential surrogate endpoint for overall survival at the patient level, within a large, retrospective cohort of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer who underwent radiotherapy (dose ≥50 Gy [relative biological effectiveness]) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Post-radiotherapy follow-up consisted of a clinical evaluation 8-12 weeks after treatment, then surveillance every 3 months for 2 years and every 6-12 months thereafter, incorporating imaging and physical examination to assess response and detect disease recurrence. The primary dichotomous outcome was progression-free status at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. Overall survival outcomes were compared with those of age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar year-matched general populations sourced from US Life Tables, using expected survival estimates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and Dec 27, 2022, 1245 patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy were included in the analysis (median age 61 years [IQR 55-68]; 1093 [87·8%] male patients and 152 [12·2%] female patients). Median follow-up from the start of radiotherapy was 63·3 months (IQR 40·4-91·3). 5-year overall survival was 89·3% (95% CI 87·4-91·2). 1183 patients had follow-up data for 24-month progression-free status assessment with 1044 (88·3%) progression-free at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. The SMR after reaching 24-month progression-free status was 1·2 (95% CI 1·0-1·6; p=0·090). The 5-year subsequent overall survival of patients who reached 24-month progression-free status was 93·1% (95% CI 91·1-95·1), similar to the expected 5-year overall survival of 92·7% in the matched US general population. In patients with disease progression within 24 months, 5-year subsequent overall survival was 33·5% (25·4-44·2), versus an expected 5-year overall survival of 91·1% in the matched US general population, with a corresponding SMR of 17·9 (14·3-22·2; p&lt;0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Progression-free status at 24 months was a strong prognostic marker for overall survival at the patient level in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and future trial-level analysis is now warranted. The adoption of this endpoint has the potential to accelerate therapeutic development by enabling earlier evaluation of treatment activity, thereby facilitating the timely introduction of novel therapies to this patient population before the availability of mature overall survival data. FUNDING: This research was funded in part through the US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748.</description>

We also examined the characteristics that could predict chemotherapy medication quality. METHODS: Samples of seven commonly used chemotherapy medications were collected: cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, leucovorin, methotrexate, and oxaliplatin. Stockouts and medicine prices were recorded at public national hospitals and community pharmacies. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's harmonized guidelines for sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated the costs of medications to treat early-stage breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and head and neck cancer. Every sample was tested for quality using high-performance liquid chromatography against USP standards. We ran logistic regressions to assess medicine characteristics that could predict substandard and falsified chemotherapy medications. RESULTS: Stockouts of chemotherapy medications in public hospitals were observed in three of four countries. Other than in Malawi where medications are free when available in the public sector, chemotherapy medications were unaffordable, costing government worker salary equivalents of 47-242 days, 233-869 days, and 22-196 days to treat early-stage breast cancer, CRC, and head and neck cancer, respectively. On average across the population, $36 US dollars (USD) (95% CI, $50 USD to $134 USD, 9%-25% of medication cost) was spent on poor-quality medicines for treatment of breast cancer, $32 USD (95% CI, $6 USD to $214 USD, 0.5%-17%) for CRC, and $15 USD (95% CI, $4 USD to $49 USD, 2%-21%) for head and neck cancer. Price of the medication, public/private source, and medicine registration status were poor predictors of medicine quality. CONCLUSION: We found that medicines for cancer treatment are unaffordable without government subsidies. Moreover, poor-quality chemotherapy medicines are hard to detect without chemical testing. Government policies and supply chain practice changes are needed to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of chemotherapy medications in sub-Saharan Africa.</description>

This approach is associated with early adverse effects, notably oral mucositis (OM). The C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) is a promising novel biomarker used to assess the severity of inflammatory responses in various chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of pretreatment CAR for the occurrence and severity of OM of varying grades during RT in patients with LC. METHODS: The pretreatment CAR values were calculated in 68 patients treated with RT due to locally advanced or advanced LC. RESULTS: The increased incidence of severe grade OM in LC patients between weeks III and VII of RT was significantly associated with higher CAR values. A high CAR was significantly correlated with an increased risk of grade 3 OM at the end of the IIIrd (p = 0.026), IVth (p = 0.018), Vth (p = 0.027), VIth (p = 0.018), and VIIth (p = 0.004) week of RT. Multivariable analysis demonstrates a higher probability of developing severe OM in LC patients with an elevated median CAR following IIIrd (p = 0.025), IVth (p = 0.025), Vth (p = 0.025), VIth (p = 0.020), and VIIth (p = 0.035) cycle of irradiation. Furthermore, CAR values allowed reliable differentiation of patients who developed grade 3 OM between the IIIrd-VIIth weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment CAR value indicates clinical utility in predicting the likelihood of severe OM induced by RT-based therapy in patients with LC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the framework proposed, the histopathological images are subjected to a preprocessing technique, and then, the images are fed directly to the NASNet-Large model for the extraction of high-level discriminative texture features. The resultant vectors obtained from the features extracted act as input to the search space of Archimedes Optimization Algorithm that carries out dimensionality reduction and optimal hyperparameter tuning simultaneously. The optimized feature subset is fed to the final classifier, namely the Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder that learns robust latent representations. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.38%, a precision of 95.15%, a sensitivity of 91.78%, a specificity of 91.85%, and an F1-score of 93.72%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of the SSDA-AOA framework as an effective tool for the early detection and precise classification of oral cancer, paving the way for improved patient outcomes through timely intervention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This innovative approach may significantly enhance patient outcomes by facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment, addressing the urgent need for more reliable diagnostic tools in oncology.</description>

This study aimed to compare the impact of perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression stockings (IPCS) and medical thrombosis prophylactic stockings (MTPS) on thromboembolic incidence. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 98 patients who underwent total laryngectomy between March 2018 and March 2024. Patient records and an electronic database were reviewed for thromboembolic events. From March 2021 onward, IPCS replaced MTPS, enabling a before-after comparison. To assess the effect of IPCS on PE, an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression model was used, accounting for comorbidities and perioperative risk factors. RESULTS: In our cohort, 13 patients (13%) developed pulmonary embolism (PE). A history of thromboembolic events significantly increased PE risk (OR 17.8, p = 0.015). Postoperative bleeding occurred in 5.1% of patients and was associated with a higher PE incidence. IPCS use significantly reduced PE risk (adjusted OR 0.0508, unadjusted OR 0.1080) in the IPTW model. CONCLUSIONS: IPCS significantly reduced PE risk compared to MTPS, indicating definite prophylactic benefits. Patients with a history of thromboembolic events are at higher risk for PE after laryngectomy, which also increases the risk of postoperative bleeding and reoperation due to the required anticoagulation.</description>

Surgical drains have traditionally been used to mitigate these risks, but their necessity is increasingly debated due to concerns over pain, infection, and prolonged hospitalisation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of using surgical drains following thyroidectomy. This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials aimed to compare postoperative surgical outcomes in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery, managed with or without drains. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, EMCARE, and CINAHL) were systematically searched in August 2025 for articles published between January 1995 and August 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes in patients undergoing thyroidectomy with and without drains were included. Of the initial 119 articles identified, 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis, representing 1,078 patients. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pooled proportions were calculated and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method. The random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was then conducted using inverse variance weighting, with between-study variance (τ2) estimated via the DerSimonian and Laird method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included haematoma and seroma rates; secondary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI), return-to-theatre (RTT), postoperative pain, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Pooled complication rates were: haematoma 1.6%, seroma 3.7%, SSI 2.5%, and RTT 0.2%. Drain use was not associated with significant differences in haematoma (p = 0.15), seroma (p = 0.64), or RTT (p = 0.22). However, SSI (4.2% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.01), LOS (mean difference [MD] = 1.2 days; p &lt; 0.0001), and pain (MD = 2.2; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the drain group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Routine placement of drains after all types of thyroidectomies does not significantly decrease the rates of haematoma, seroma, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and is linked to higher rates of surgical site infection, pain, and length of stay. A selective, patient-specific approach to drain use is recommended.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hansen CR, Tadic T, Sharma M, Price G, Petersen J, Naser MA, Xiao Y, Kovalchuk N, Lassen P, Overgaard J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.023'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.023&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41628865/'&gt;41628865&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: Radiotherapy treatment planning hinges on a critical factor: the prescribed dose. Surprisingly, there is no consistent, standardised global approach to evaluating the dosimetry of this prescription across different centres treating head and neck cancer (HNC). This study aimed to quantify global dose variations for identical prescriptions across international centres treating oropharyngeal cancer, to establish the foundation for future outcome-based studies and improve consistency of interpretation worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were consecutively treated from 2017 onwards with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) at eight globally recognised radiotherapy departments. These centres were categorised into four categories: North American, North European, Oceanic, and Asian. RESULTS: The study included 1,514 patients from eight centres and revealed 40 different dose prescriptions, ranging from 55 Gy in 20 to 70 Gy in 35 fractions. When normalised to a 70 Gy prescription, the mean CTV dose showed a 4% median difference across centres. European and Oceania centres deviated by 0.4%, while North American and Asian centres had 2% variability. Near-minimum CTV doses (D98%) ranged from 68.7 Gy to 71.4 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the wide-ranging implementation of dose prescriptions in HNC. The lack of a standardised global approach to HNC treatment dose prescription carries potential implications for patient care, collaborative research, and treatment de-escalation or radiotherapy dose-painting strategies. This study highlights the need for careful interpretation of dose prescription standards across international centres, to analyse radiotherapy outcomes more accurately in light of their varied implementation.</description>

Due to high survival rates, maintaining quality of life-especially swallowing function-is an important long-term consideration. This study aimed to assess swallowing outcomes five years and beyond following TORS in patients with primary OPSCC. METHODS: "Functional outcome swallowing scale" (FOSS) was used to retrospectively assess long-term dysphagia in 47 OPSCC patients, with a median follow-up of 6.8 years. All patients had a minimum follow-up of five years. RESULTS: The FOSS scores remained stable at five years compared to 1-4 years post-TORS (all p &gt; 0.99). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in FOSS from 1 to 10 years post-TORS compared to preoperative score. Adjuvant therapy was a univariate predictor of worse swallowing outcomes (OR: 17.46, 95% CrI: 2.94-121.51); however, this effect was limited to the short-term postoperative period (≤ 2 years after TORS). In contrast, subsequent major surgery after TORS and treatment of more advanced tumors (pT2-pT3 vs. pTis-pT1) were associated with persistently worse swallowing outcomes, including long-term follow-up (OR: 23.81, 95% CrI: 4.48-142.59; OR: 15.03, 95% CrI: 3.06-81.45, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TORS offers excellent and stable long-term swallowing outcomes when used as a single-modality treatment for OPSCC. While outcomes remain satisfactory with additional therapies, swallowing results are influenced by tumor stage, adjuvant treatment, and further major surgery.</description>

Increasing evidence highlights that the tumour microenvironment (TME) plays a central role in disease progression and therapeutic response. Distinct immune and stromal profiles have been observed between HPV positive (HPV+) and HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC, underpinning their differing natural history and responses to immunotherapy. Despite advances, only 15-20% of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (RMHNSCC) respond to immunotherapy, with no difference in response being seen between HPV+ and HPV- disease. This may reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the TME. This review explores how emerging spatial omics technologies, combining molecular, and spatial context, are reshaping our understanding of the HNSCC microenvironment, with emphasis on recurrent and/or metastatic disease. By delineating the spatial organisation of immune, stromal, and metabolic features, these approaches provide new insights into mechanisms of treatment resistance, prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Understanding spatial TME dynamics across HPV-related subtypes may ultimately guide more precise and effective treatment strategies for HNSCC.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: National Cancer Database (NCDB), 2004 to 2022. METHODS: Adult patients younger than 50 years diagnosed with OCSCC in the NCDB. Annual case distributions by subsite, sex, and stage were modeled with logistic regression, reporting odds ratios (ORs) per calendar year over time. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses assessed 5-year overall survival (OS), stratified by age group, subsite, and stage. RESULTS: Among 178,140 OCSCC cases, 21,630 (12.1%) were EO-OCSCC with median age of 44 years. Tongue was the most common subsite (66.9%) and increased over time (OR/year = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04). Female cases rose steadily (OR/year = 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02), narrowing the male-female gap. Advanced-stage disease increased by 5% annually in tongue tumors and 3% in non-tongue tumors. Five-year OS was higher in tongue (73.7%) than non-tongue tumors (61.5%, P &lt; .001) and improved over time, with annual reductions in mortality risk of 1.1% for tongue and 1.9% for non-tongue tumors. By age group, survival was highest for patients 20-29 years and lowest for those 40-49 years. CONCLUSION: EO-OCSCC is increasingly presenting as tongue primaries and in female patients, with a rising burden of advanced-stage disease. Despite this unfavorable shift, survival has improved modestly across subsites, ages, and stages, underscoring the heterogeneity of EO-OCSCC and the need for earlier detection and awareness.</description>

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant, is hypothesized to enhance salivary secretion and promote the regeneration of acinar cells. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of ALA on unstimulated salivary flow rate in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 20 patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (receiving 1200 mg/day ALA) or to the control group (receiving placebo) for three months. Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (mL/min) was measured using the spitting method at baseline (pre-radiotherapy) and at weeks 2, 6, 8, and 12 post-radiotherapy. Xerostomia severity was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), alongside clinical signs of hyposalivation (e.g., frothy saliva, mucosal adherence). Data were analyzed using t-tests and Fisher's exact test in SPSS version 25.00, with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Although both groups indicated a decline in salivary flow over time, no significant intergroup differences were observed at any follow-up point (P &gt; 0.05). Within the ALA group, pairwise comparisons revealed a significant reduction in salivary flow from baseline to weeks 6, 8, and 12 (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, and P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, a significant reduction was observed between weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.011). No significant differences between groups were found in NRS scores or clinical indicators of hyposalivation during any follow-up session (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 1200 mg/day ALA may temporarily delay the onset of salivary gland dysfunction in the early phases of radiotherapy. However, this effect was not statistically significant and may not have a sustained clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (IR.SBMU.DRC.REC.1401.062) and registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20221219056864N1, registered on December 19, 2022).</description>

Large language models (LLMs) may support guideline-based decision-making, although performance in complex oncologic scenarios is not well defined. METHODS: Fourteen synthetic cases based on real tumor board encounters were evaluated. Five blinded comparator arms produced recommendations: a human expert, Non-RAG-GPT-4, Non-RAG-GPT-5, RAG-GPT-4, and RAG-GPT-5. Eight head and neck oncologic surgeons scored each recommendation for appropriateness, clarity, specificity, and feasibility using 5-point Likert scales. Paired permutation testing and inter-rater reliability were assessed. RESULTS: LLM outputs showed close alignment with expert recommendations. RAG-based models achieved the highest mean scores across domains, with some statistically significant differences versus the expert comparator in appropriateness and clarity; however, absolute differences were modest. Inter-rater reliability was strong (ICC 0.73-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced LLMs can generate guideline-concordant management recommendations in simulated head and neck cancer cases, supporting potential utility for decision support and education; prospective validation and expert oversight remain essential.</description>

A subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Data regarding HPV-driven HNSCC from low- and middle-income countries is lacking. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentre study of adult patients diagnosed with primary HNSCC between 2016 and 2020 was carried out. HPV status was determined through detection of high-risk HPV mRNA via in situ hybridization (RNAISH). Tumours were classified as being HPV-driven when there was positivity for RNAISH. p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV DNA detection and genotyping (HPVDNA) via a PCR-based method were also carried out. The prognostic utility of RNAISH, p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) alone and combined p16INK4a &amp; HPVDNA were assessed using survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 356 cases of HNSCC were assessed for HPV status. Median age was 64 years (IQR: 15), and 69.9% of patients were males. The prevalence of HPV-driven HNSCC was approximately 11.0% (95% CI: 7.9-14.7%). The vast majority of HPV-driven HNSCC were from the oropharynx (94.9%). None of the tumours originating from the oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx were HPV-driven. Seven different genotypes were found in HPV-driven HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, HPV-driven HNSCC was primarily encountered in tumours originating from the oropharynx. HPV16 was the most frequently encountered genotype in our cohort. It is recommended that determination of HPV status be based on single testing with RNAISH or dual testing of p16INK4a IHC in conjunction with HPVDNA as an acceptable alternative in resource limited settings to improve patient stratification for treatment as well as clinical outcomes.</description>

METHODS: This prospective, single-center, and randomized controlled trial included 196 patients with PTC who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ETGUA group (n = 98) or the open thyroidectomy group (n = 98). Complications within 30 days, parathyroid function [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium], and short-term oncological outcomes were observed. Secondary outcomes included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative recovery, pain score, cosmetic satisfaction, and hospitalization cost. RESULTS: The ETGUA group had a significantly longer operative time than the open thyroidectomy group, less intraoperative blood loss, more postoperative drainage at postoperative day 1, as well as a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all p &lt; 0.05). At 1 year postoperatively, surgical efficacy and oncological indicators such as the number of lymph nodes dissected, number of positive lymph nodes, stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) level, and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy were comparable between groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ETGUA group reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and higher cosmetic satisfaction, though the total hospitalization cost was slightly higher (all p &lt; 0.05). The learning curve analysis indicated that operative time and intraoperative blood loss stabilized after approximately 30-40 cases. CONCLUSION: ETGUA demonstrates comparable safety and oncological efficacy to conventional open thyroidectomy in PTC patients.</description>

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients who underwent a salvage oropharyngectomy in an irradiated neck for recurrent or metachronous oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) between 2014 and 2023. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included. Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were 31.7%, 58.5%, and 55.2%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, pN+ status (HR 2.32; p = 0.031), pT status ≥ 3 (HR 2.03; p = 0.020), and age (HR 1.05; p = 0.014) were associated with OS. DSS was associated with pT status ≥ 3 (HR 5.24; p &lt; 0.001), metachronous (vs. recurrent) OPSCC (HR 0.32; p = 0.006), and cN+ status (HR 2.31; p = 0.053). LRFS was associated with metachronous OPSCC (HR 0.30; p = 0.002) and pT status ≥ 3 (HR 3.60; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This last-resort procedure is associated with poor survival outcomes. In this series, patients with p16-positive OPSCC did not fare better than their p16-negative counterparts.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haist M, Baertsch MA, Reticker-Flynn NE, Lu G, Kempchen TN, Chu P, Vazquez G, Chen H, Sunwoo JB, Zhang W, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer cell | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2026.01.003'&gt;10.1016/j.ccell.2026.01.003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41616773/'&gt;41616773&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lymph node (LN) colonization in cancer is linked to poor prognosis. Evidence suggests that LN colonization induces systemic immunosuppression, facilitating distant metastasis. We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-γ signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.</description>

Understanding the roles of ubiquitination-related genes in THCA progression and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME) could provide valuable insights into prognosis and treatment strategies. METHODS: Using iUUCD 2.0, ubiquitination-related genes were identified and subjected to consensus clustering on TCGA-THCA data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified and used to construct a ubiquitination-related signature using Cox and LASSO regression. The signature's prognostic ability was validated using training and test datasets from TCGA. Immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Three ubiquitination clusters were identified among 454 genes. Four prognostic DEGs (F12, FBXO15, FBXW10, and USP44) formed the signature, significantly correlating with survival, immune cell infiltration, clinical characteristics, immune checkpoints, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Low-risk THCA patients had better prognosis and immunotherapy responses than high-risk patients. A stable nomogram combining the signature and clinical characteristics predicted patient survival. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed differential expression of key genes. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies and validates a novel four-gene ubiquitination-related signature as a promising and independent prognostic biomarker in THCA. Beyond outcome prediction, this signature demonstrates significant translational potential by accurately predicting immunotherapy responses, thereby facilitating the development of more personalized and effective treatment strategies for patients with THCA.</description>

Nevertheless, a critical gap remains in understanding the epidemiological burden of LOC among young people (15-44 years) in the region. This study aims to analyze the burden and risk factors of LOC in this age group across the four Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Asian regions from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2030. METHODS: Data on the incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and risk factors of LOC from 1990 to 2021 were obtained from the GBD 2021 study for East, South, Southeast Asia, and High-income Asia Pacific. This study assessed the LOC burden among young people (15-44 years) through age- and sex-stratified analyses, evaluated temporal trends via joinpoint regression, examined risk factor contributions, and projected trends to 2030 using the Nordpred age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased across all subregions, with the largest rise in East Asia. In contrast, age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate declined everywhere except South Asia. In 2021, South Asia bore the heaviest LOC burden among young people in the four Asian subregions. India reported the highest incident cases, deaths, and DALYs in 2021, and Pakistan had the highest ASR for all three metrics. Taiwan (Province of China) showed the largest increase in ASRs over the period. In 2021, smoking had the highest contribution in East Asia, alcohol use in High-income Asia Pacific, and chewing tobacco in South Asia. Projections to 2030 indicate rising ASIR in East, South, and Southeast Asia but declines in High-income Asia Pacific; decreasing ASMR everywhere except South Asia; and increasing age-standardized DALYs rate in East and South Asia but decreases elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: LOC imposes a substantial and growing burden on young people in South, East, and Southeast Asia, marked by rising ASIR since 1990 and projected increases through 2030. South Asia faces the most urgent challenge with concurrent rises in incidence, mortality, and DALYs-most notably in the 20-24 age group. Region-specific interventions targeting predominant risk factors are critically needed.</description>

This study aimed to evaluated the cumulative dose deviations resulting from different planning target volume (PTV) margins during tomotherapy (TOMO) using megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) and investigated the feasibility of individualized margin optimization, with the goal of minimizing volume and protecting surrounding tissues. METHODS: Forty patients with NPC treated with TOMO were retrospectively analyzed. Daily MVCT scans were acquired throughout treatment. Using deformable image registration, the dose from each fraction was mapped to the planning CT, and cumulative doses were reconstructed using MIM software. For each patient, isotropic 1-4 mm virtual expansions were applied to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) to generate "virtual" structures. These were evaluated for V100% dose coverage under the accumulated dose. Planned and accumulated doses were compared across expansion margins using V100%, D95%, conformity index, and homogeneity index, with differences assessed by paired t-tests. Dose variations in organs at risk (OARs) were also assessed. RESULTS: Planned and accumulated V100% doses were within 5% for most targets, however, certain virtual expansions demonstrated detectable dose discrepancies. For GTVnx, a +2 mm margin significantly reduced accumulated V100% (96.55% ± 3.04%) compared with the planned dose (99.18% ± 0.73%; p &lt; 0.001). For GTVnd, both +1 mm and +2 mm margins significantly reduced accumulated V100% (99.21% ± 1.17% and 99.20% ± 1.17%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). For CTV1, a +2 mm margin yielded higher accumulated V100% (99.57% ± 1.49%) than planned (99.89% ± 0.21%; p = 0.212), suggesting deformation-related over-coverage. Larger margins (3-4 mm) reduced coverage, though not significantly. For CTV2, accumulated V100% remained consistent across all margins. The +1 mm expansion produced a small but significant increase (99.72% ± 0.38% vs 99.99% ± 0.23%; p = 0.006), while larger expansions (2-4 mm) had no effect, suggesting 1-2 mm may be optimal. CONCLUSION: MVCT-based cumulative dose evaluation provides a more accurate assessment of the delivered dose than conventional geometric methods. Individualized, dose-driven PTV margin strategies may improve tumor coverage while minimizing OAR exposure, thereby advancing precision radiotherapy for NPC.</description>

Dendritic cells, major regulators of specific anti-tumor immune response, are often impaired in their function in the context of cancer. METHODS: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were incubated with isolated small extracellular vesicles during or after maturation. Cell surface markers and antigen processing machinery were assessed by flow cytometry. Vesicle-treated dendritic cells were tested for interleukin 12p70 production by ELISA, and differences in uptake of labeled vesicles were shown by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Small extracellular vesicles derived from HPV(+) tumor cell lines increased maturation and activation of immature dendritic cells, priming them for more rapid phagocytosis. Immature dendritic cells co-incubated with vesicles had lower levels of antigen presenting machinery components and produced less IL12p70 than controls, while similarly co-incubated mature dendritic cells remained unaffected. Vesicles in plasma of patients with head and neck cancer inhibited functions of mature dendritic cells by downregulating expression of antigen presenting machinery components. CONCLUSION: Our results uncover mechanisms through which tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles modulate dendritic cell functions locally and systemically. These mechanisms may also affect dendritic cell-based vaccine efficacy.</description>

Although radiation dose is a key factor, other clinical and demographic risk factors also influence ORN development. Previous predictive models have primarily been single-institutional, limiting their generalizability. In this first analysis from the PREDMORN Consortium, we have aimed to reproduce existing statistical association and modeling analyses on the largest and most diverse mandibular ORN cohort worldwide to allow comparison with previous studies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective multi-institutional study included 3928 patients with HNC (622 ORN cases) from 8 institutions. Clinical, demographic, and dosimetric variables were analyzed to develop a prediction model (any grade ORN vs no ORN) using forward stepwise logistic regression with correlation-based variable preselection. The ORN normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was developed on 80% of data from 6 institutions, tested on the remaining unseen 20%, and externally validated on a matched cohort (58 patients, 19 ORN cases) and a large population-based cohort (2687 patients, 215 ORN cases). RESULTS: Key predictors of ORN were D30%, V70Gy, pre-RT dental extractions, and smoking status. The ORN NTCP model demonstrated very good calibration on the population-based external cohort (Brier score, 0.077; Log Loss, 0.281). Model discrimination improved on a subcohort including oropharyngeal and locally advanced larynx/hypopharynx cancer cases only (AUC from 0.69 to 0.75 and from 0.65 to 0.67 on the matched and the population-based external cohorts, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PREDMORN NTCP model is the largest multi-institutional effort to date aimed at predicting ORN risk in patients with HNC using real-world data. The model demonstrated good generalizability when externally validated to a large population-based cohort. Our observations align with current guidelines and corroborate findings from smaller single-institution studies.</description>

However, prospectively collected data for smell dysfunction have been limited, especially in the era of intensity-modulated RT (IMRT). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of RT with olfactory function in patients with HNC receiving IMRT, including changes in olfactory function over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nonrandomized clinical trial enrolled patients with histologically confirmed HNC between January 1, 2021, and December 1, 2023, who underwent curative treatment with IMRT at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan. Participants scheduled for RT underwent olfactory function assessment using the Taiwan Smell Identification Test at multiple time points, including before RT; at the end of RT; and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. Nasal endoscopy was used to rule out confounding nasal conditions. EXPOSURE: Intensity-modulated RT with and without concurrent chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The association between Taiwan Smell Identification Test scores and olfactory region radiation dose was analyzed using linear regression, and an estimative model was developed to calculate a threshold dose. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients (median [range] age, 55 [32-75] years; 52 male [82.5%]) with normal olfactory function before RT were included. The most common primary cancer site was the oral cavity and oropharynx (37 participants [58.7%]), followed by the nasopharynx (16 participants [25.4%]). A moderate positive correlation was observed between radiation dose and olfactory dysfunction. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified 22 Gy as a potential inflection point for estimating olfactory impairment. By multivariable analysis, a mean radiation dose to the olfactory region exceeding 22 Gy was the only independent risk factor for olfactory dysfunction (odds ratio, 20.65; 95% CI, 2.60-164.35). Some patients treated with high-dose radiation experienced persistent olfactory dysfunction of up to 1 year. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found a dose-dependent association between RT and olfactory dysfunction in patients with HNC, identifying 22 Gy as an important inflection point. To minimize the risk of long-term olfactory impairment, optimizing RT planning by carefully adjusting radiation dose and target area may be beneficial.

Postoperative brachytherapy is a treatment option, but it is not always feasible; stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) may offer a noninvasive alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate late toxic effects and 2-year local control after postoperative SBRT to the primary tumor bed in patients with early-stage OCSCC or OPSCC and high-risk resection margins. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This national, multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted across 18 academic centers in France in the Groupe d'Oncologie Radiothérapie Tête et Cou (GORTEC) network. Adults with pT1 to pT2 OCSCC or OPSCC and R1 or smaller than 5 mm margins, pN0 or pN1 without extracapsular extension, no indication for neck irradiation, and not planned for adjuvant chemotherapy were enrolled between April 2018 and August 2021. Final analysis was conducted from February to May 2024. INTERVENTION: SBRT to the surgical bed, 36 Gy in 6 fractions over 2 weeks, using volumetric modulated arctherapy (VMAT) or CyberKnife, with image guidance and quality assurance protocols. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 2-year rate of grade 3 or greater late toxic effects (&gt;90 days after treatment), per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03. The key secondary end point was 2-year local control. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module (QLQ-HN35). RESULTS: Among 90 patients (median [range] age, 64 [31-87] years; 51 [56.5%] male), at 2 years, 2 patients (2.2%) had grade 3 late toxic effects, while 13 patients (14.6%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 late toxic effect during the 2-year follow-up period, mainly soft-tissue necrosis and osteoradionecrosis, most of which were transitory. The 2-year local control rate was 92.0% (95% CI, 84.6%-96.4%). Acute grade 3 or greater toxic effects were limited to mucositis (28.9%; 95% CI, 19.8%-39.4%), mostly resolving by 3 months. Median follow-up was 25 months (range, 3-31 months). Disease-free and overall survival at 2 years were 73.3% (95% CI, 63.4%-81.7%) and 88.8% (95% CI, 80.9%-94.2%), respectively. QoL scores showed a transient decline at 1 month followed by recovery and improvement at 12 and 24 months. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this phase 2 nonrandomized clinical trial, postoperative primary tumor bed SBRT for early-stage OCSCC and OPSCC with high-risk margins was associated with manageable toxic effects and high rates of local control. These findings support SBRT as a promising approach in carefully selected patients, but confirmatory randomized trials are needed.

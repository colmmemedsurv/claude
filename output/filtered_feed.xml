There is considerable variation in the prevalence of histopathologically detected extranodal extension in comparable studies. The Head and Neck Cancer International Group, which includes 23 organisations managing patients with head and neck cancer, identified several challenges in evaluating histopathologically detected extranodal extension. Thus, the Head and Neck Consensus Language for Ease and Reproducibility (HN-CLEAR) and its global stakeholders prioritised developing diagnostic criteria and uniform terminology for histopathologically detected extranodal extension. The histopathologically detected extranodal extension working group established by WHO, International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting, American Joint Committee on Cancer, Union for International Cancer Control, North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology, and American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology committees undertook consensus deliberations using scanned whole slides and a PRISMA literature review-based scoping questionnaire. The guidelines were tested by 30 additional pathologists across six continents and strengthened with prescriptive diagnostic criteria and unifying terminology based on the inter-rater concordance analyses. This Review generates practically useful consensus diagnostic recommendations and aligned terminology for addressing the gaps in the histopathologically detected extranodal extension literature. The recommendations can be used globally and cater to all levels of medical resources, practices, and experiences, thus ensuring equitable patient care.</description>

We aimed to propose an end-to-end deep learning framework called NPC-SurvAI to perform prognosis assessment using MRI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 2180 NPC patients who underwent baseline MRI. The NPC-SurvAI comprised an AttVNet for image segmentation and a DenseNet-ICAM for prognosis evaluation, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The clinical model was built with age, T-stage, N-stage, and EBV DNA. The image and combined models were developed by the NPC-SurvAI framework. The integrated area under the curve (iAUC) and thetime-dependent AUC (tAUC) were leveraged to measure the predictive accuracy. K-means clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to stratify patients into subtypes and compare their prognoses. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, the AttVNet achieved average Dice similarity coefficients of 0.726-0.764 tumor segmentation. The dynamic change curves of the AUCs over time suggested that the combined model outperformed both the clinical and image models in predicting PFS (iAUC: 0.838-0.884 vs 0.788-0.844 vs 0.738-0.798) and OS (iAUC: 0.842-0.894 vs 0.793-0.853 vs 0.754-0.807) at any time point from 1 to 8 years. Specially, the combined model achieved time-AUCs of 0.844-0.930 for 3-year PFS and 0.827-0.896 for 5-year PFS; 0.838-0.978 for 3-year OS and 0.788-0.871 for 5-year OS. Additionally, patients could be stratified into two subtypes with different survivals (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NPC-SurvAI has the potential to automatically stratify patients with diverse prognoses, which helps clinicians in optimizing treatment decisions and surveillance.</description>

Comparative HRQOL data between active surveillance, thermal ablation, and surgery remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare HRQOL among adults with PTMC undergoing active surveillance, thermal ablation, or surgery to inform shared decision-making. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 17, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included adult patients with PTMC and compared at least 2 relevant interventions while reporting PROs. Studies restricted to noncomparative designs or non-PTMC populations were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving discrepancies with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S guidelines; the meta-analysis adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified by a second. Study quality was assessed using established critical appraisal checklists. Random-effects models were applied to obtain mean differences with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was domain-specific HRQOL (eg, voice problems, neuromuscular symptoms, psychological distress), as measured using the Thyroid Cancer Quality of Life (THYCA-QOL), Korean Thyroid-specific Quality of Life (KT-QOL), and other validated instruments. RESULTS: Of 988 retrieved records, 13 studies comprising 5793 patients were included: 2356 underwent active surveillance, 242 received thermal ablation (211 radiofrequency, 31 laser), and 3195 underwent surgery (2350 lobectomy, 833 total thyroidectomy, 12 unspecified). Active surveillance was consistently associated with better PROs compared with surgery across thyroid-specific domains, including neuromuscular symptoms, voice problems, concentration issues, psychological distress, sympathetic complaints, feelings of being chilly, and scar-related concerns. Generic instruments (eg, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, version 2) supported these findings. Low-certainty evidence indicated that thermal ablation was associated with better HRQOL than surgery after 3 to 6 months, although these differences diminished by 12 months. Across studies, heterogeneity arose from differences in treatment strategies and comparators, outcome instruments and duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that patients whose PTMC was managed with active surveillance reported equal or better HRQOL than those undergoing surgery. These findings support the importance of incorporating PROs into shared decision-making for low-risk thyroid cancer.</description>

CUP poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges and is linked to poorer survival outcomes. Its incidence is expected to rise with the increasing prevalence of HPV-positive HNSCC. This study evaluated the use of MRI, 18F-FDG PET, examination under anesthesia (EUA), and TORS-assisted tonsillectomy and tongue base mucosectomy (TORS-TE/TBM) in the work-up of CUP. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 79 patients with cytologically confirmed CUP (years 2019-2024). HPV-positive (n = 51) and HPV-negative (n = 28) cases were evaluated separately. Primary tumor detection rates for MRI, 18F-FDG PET and EUA were calculated. For HPV-positive tumors TORS-TE/TBM was additionally evaluated for primary tumor detection. RESULTS: In HPV-positive cases MRI and 18F-FDG PET had detection rates of 45% individually (respectively) and 53% combined. Of detected cases, 37% were identified by a single modality. Post-hoc image review increased the detection rate to 63%. Subsequent imaging-guided EUA had a detection rate of 68%. When TORS-TE/TBM was performed after negative EUA, tumor detection occurred in 50% of cases. Multimodal work-up resulted in an over-all detection rate of 75%. In contrast, HPV-negative cases had a lower over-all multimodal detection rate of 39%. CONCLUSION: MRI and 18F-FDG PET each play a pivotal and complimentary role for the detection of primary tumors in HNSCC CUP. Image-guided EUA and, in selected cases, TORS-TE/TBM further improve detection. A multimodal approach including expert imaging interpretation is recommended for optimal tumor identification and treatment planning.</description>

Preradiation dental clearance is critical, but its role in radiation delay is unknown. We sought to understand the relationship between dental clearance and RT delays in HNC patients. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. SETTING: Single-institution, HNC patients referred for pre-radiation dental clearance in 2023. METHODS: Dental clearance delay (DCD) was defined as clearance more than 5 weeks following initial clinic, biopsy, or resection. Radiation treatment delay (RTD) was defined as adjuvant RT starting more than 6 weeks after cancer resection or primary RT starting more than 6 weeks after initial clinic visit or diagnostic biopsy. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to identify predictors of RTD, DCD, and dental extractions. RESULTS: Of 160 patients meeting inclusion criteria, nearly 60% experienced RTD. Patients with increasing days from diagnosis to dental referral and increasing days from dental referral to clearance were more likely to experience RTD. DCD was more likely with increasing days from diagnosis to dental referral and among patients requiring dental extractions. Dental extractions were more likely with increasing age and Medicaid or no insurance compared to private insurance. CONCLUSION: Increasing time from diagnosis to dental referral and increasing time from dental referral to clearance were significantly associated with RTD. Patients requiring extractions were more likely to be older, on Medicaid or uninsured, and to experience DCD. These findings highlight patients with increased risk for RTD and inform future studies to streamline dental clearance.</description>

METHODS: In this nonrandomized prospective study previously unvaccinated adults (ages 18-45) were surveyed about their willingness to undergo HPV vaccination before and after targeted educational intervention. Data were collected between March 2023 and March 2024 in 2 separate otolaryngology clinics located in Boston, MA. The intervention educated patients about HPV and OPSCC and the role of HPV vaccination in preventing HPV + OPSCC. Subjects interested in vaccination received point-of-care vaccination when meeting vaccination criteria. Interest in vaccination and vaccination rate before and after provided intervention. Gender, race, education, and age ranges as predictors of interest in vaccination are compared using odds ratios. RESULTS: Preintervention interest in vaccination was 32.7% (101/309). In subjects not interested in vaccination, provider-free digital intervention led to vaccination acceptance in 17.3% (35/201) of patients (total vaccination rate 44.0% (136/309)). Non-white participants were 2.5 times more likely to be interested in vaccination after intervention compared to white participants. DISCUSSION: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination rates remain significantly below other common childhood vaccines, which has implications for future rates of HPV-associated Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HPV + OPSCC). Patients are more likely to be vaccinated against HPV if they are aware of its association with OPSCC. Use of a provider-free digital intervention at the point-of-care increases desire for vaccination, and this may be more effective in non-white participants. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Tailored educational provider-free interventions linking HPV infection to head and neck cancer coupled with point-of-care vaccination increases rates of HPV vaccination in unvaccinated adult patients.</description>

METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of national NCDB 2004-2022 United States adults with Stages III-IVB HNSCC. Exposure was any IO. The primary outcome was OS from diagnosis; analyses used multivariable Cox models, 24-month landmarking, and propensity methods. RESULTS: Among 221 116 patients (mean age: 62), 10 023 (4.5%) received IO. Median follow-up 37 months. IO was associated with lower mortality (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Landmark analysis showed benefit 0-24 months (HR: 0.76; 0.74-0.79) that reversed thereafter (HR: 1.09; 1.04-1.14). By intent, median OS was 53.2 months (neoadjuvant), 50.1 months (adjuvant), 16.5 months (later-line), versus 60.7 months without IO. Propensity analyses attenuated effects (HR: ~1.00). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world advanced HNSCC, IO confers modest early benefit with varied long-term results; outcomes vary by timing. Prospective biomarker-stratified trials are needed.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen M, Wang J, Tu L, Zheng H, Xu J, Pang X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70146'&gt;10.1002/hed.70146&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41450235/'&gt;41450235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is an aggressive subtype of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with poor prognosis and low survival rates. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) show promise, but less than 20% of HNSCC patients respond positively. Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) combines radionuclides with monoclonal antibodies to target tumor cells. This study created a reliable animal model of PSCC for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of 131I-aPD-L1. METHODS: Nude mice were subcutaneously implanted with FaDu cells-a human PSCC cell line characterized by high PD-L1 expression. The synthesis of 131I-aPD-L1 was optimized by varying labeling conditions, achieving a labeling efficiency of over 90%. Mice were divided into experimental and control groups; the experimental group received a single intravenous injection of 500 μCi 131I-aPD-L1. Accumulation of 131I-aPD-L1 in tumor tissues was confirmed by animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Tumor volume and mouse body weight were measured every 3 days for 30 days. At the end of the study, tumor tissues were stained for histological examination and immunohistochemical analysis of Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 expression levels. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was also performed on tumor tissues. RESULTS: SPECT verified a significant accumulation of 131I in FaDu tumor tissue. The experimental group exhibited significantly slower tumor volume increase compared to the control group (t = 2.37, p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, a significant reduction in body weight was observed in the 131I-aPD-L1 group compared to the control group (t = 5.624, p &lt; 0.01). HE staining showed extensive tumor necrosis in the experimental group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed negative Bcl-2 expression and higher caspase-3 expression in the experimental group, indicating enhanced apoptosis and necrosis in tumor cells. Furthermore, TUNEL assay further confirmed that 131I exerted cytotoxic effects by inducing DNA fragmentation. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our findings demonstrate the promising therapeutic potential of 131I-aPD-L1 for PSCC, particularly in patients with drug resistance or recurrent head and neck tumors. However, the use of nude mice may have impacted the full therapeutic efficacy and synergistic potential observed with immunotherapy. Future studies should utilize immunocompetent models to better assess the probe's therapeutic impact and to explore its synergistic effects with immunotherapy and reduce the dose of 131I to mitigate its toxic effects.</description>

METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 182 patients diagnosed with OCSCC or OPSCC admitted at the São Paulo State Cancer Institute between January 2019 and November 2020. The patient interval (PI), health system diagnostic interval (HSDI), and pretreatment interval (PTI) were evaluated. RESULTS: Most patients were diagnosed at stage T3/T4 for both OCSCC (74.1%) and OPSCC (77.4%). The median PI was 1 month (IQR: 0-3), the median HSDI was 3 months (IQR: 2-6), and the median PTI was 3 months (IQR: 2-4). Patients with p16-positive OPSCC were slightly more likely to experience a longer PI (IRR = 2.38; 95% CI: 1.00-5.67; p = 0.0499). The number of healthcare services visited showed the strongest association with progressively increased HSDI. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with variations in the duration of the interval from symptom onset to treatment initiation. Targeted interventions to streamline referral pathways, strengthen professional training, and increase awareness among high-risk populations could substantially improve timeliness of care and patient outcomes.</description>

We examined the association between waterpipe smoking and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and its subsites. We analyzed data of 918 cases and 3477 controls from the IROPICAN study. Multiple logistic regression models estimated the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We additionally excluded cigarette smokers, opium users, and nass users to study the association between exclusive waterpipe smoking and HNSCC. The crude OR for ever waterpipe smoking was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.8, 1.3), which decreased to 0.8 (95% CI: 0.6, 1.1) after adjusting for confounding variables. However, we observed statistically non-significant elevated odds of HNSCC (OR: 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9, 1.9), while a significant excess odds of laryngeal cancer (OR: 2.5, 95% CI: 1.0, 5.7) in exclusive waterpipe smokers compared to never tobacco users. Additionally, an especially high OR was observed for laryngeal cancer in exclusive waterpipe smokers with more than 20 years of use (OR: 4.9, 95% CI: 1.7, 14.7). Initiating exclusive waterpipe smoking before the age of 20 was also significantly associated with increased odds of HNSCC (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.3, 6.7) and laryngeal cancer (OR: 9.0, 95% CI: 2.1, 38.2). In conclusion, although no association was found between waterpipe smoking and HNSCC, exclusive waterpipe smoking, particularly at high doses and long duration, seems to lead to an increased risk of HNSCC, especially laryngeal cancer. Larger studies with sufficient power are warranted.</description>

However, grading is associated with significant subjectivity and observer variability leading to inconsistency in prognosis prediction. Alternate histological feature-specific models ('six-point' and 'two-point') have been shown to have potentially better prognostic reliability than conventional grading. This study conducts a multicentre validation of these models. METHODS: 102 OED cases (dating 2012-2017) were acquired from 4 independent centres (13 (13%) Sheffield; 40 (39%) Belfast; 30 (29%) Birmingham; 19 (19%) Piracicaba, Brazil) were independently scored using the 'six-point' and 'two-point' models. Feature prevalence, observer agreement and malignant transformation risk were evaluated and compared to conventional grading systems. RESULTS: The 'six-point' system demonstrated superior predictive value (AUROC of 0.81) compared to the 'two-point' system (AUROC = 0.73, p = 0.004), WHO grading (AUROC = 0.71, p = 0.03) and binary grading (AUROC = 0.68, p = 0.009). Transformation rate for the 'six-point' model was 50% (95% CI 27%-78%) when all 6 features were present compared to 14% (95% CI 5%-32%) when 2-3 features were present. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the superior performance of the 'six-point' system for transformation prediction on a multicentric sample. Findings indicate that feature-specific models may be more reliable than existing histological grading systems for prognosis prediction.</description>

METHODS: Patients with T1N0M0 OTSCC were identified from the SEER database. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was utilized to balance baseline characteristics between ND and non-ND groups. Survival differences between these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and log-rank tests. Additionally, a multivariable Cox regression model was applied to the pre-matched cohort to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 2426 cases were included. In the multivariable model adjusted for key prognosticators, ND was an independent factor associated with significantly improved OS and DSS. After PSM, 1702 well-balanced patients were analyzed. Subgroup analyses based on tumor characteristics revealed that favorable survival outcomes associated with ND were predominantly observed in patients with tumor sizes 11-20 mm and those with moderate or poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with small tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, survival outcomes were comparable between the ND and observation groups. CONCLUSION: ND was associated with improved survival for T1N0M0 OTSCC patients with 11-20 mm tumors and moderate/poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with smaller tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, the observation strategy had demonstrated survival benefits comparable to ND.</description>

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pre-treatment CT/MRI scans of all T4 HPV+ OPSCC patients treated with definitive (chemo)radiotherapy in 2010-2021. Nine T4-defining features were assessed: involvement of genioglossus, hyoglossus, palatoglossus, styloglossus, pterygoid muscles (medial and lateral), bone (mandible, hard palate, pterygoid plates, skull base), larynx, nasopharynx, and carotid artery. The prognostic validity of each T4-defining feature was evaluated by comparing the risk of disease progression with that of T3 disease using univariate analysis. Multivariable analysis, stratified by treatment and adjusted for GTVp, estimated adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for risk of disease progression associated with each of the nine features within T4 disease. RESULTS: A total of 522 cases were included [T4 (239), T3 (283)]. The frequencies of individual T4-defining features were: hyoglossus (71%), palatoglossus (71%), styloglossus (68%), genioglossus (38%), carotid encasement (23%), pterygoid muscle (14%), larynx (12%) nasopharynx (8%), and bone (4%). All nine T4-defining features were associated with higher risk of cancer progression vs T3 (all p&lt;0.01). Among T4 cases, invasion of nasopharynx (aHR 2.42, 95% CI 1.20-4.90, p=0.014) and genioglossus (aHR 1.99, 95% CI 1.26-3.14, p=0.003) conferred greater risk of disease progression versus other T4-defining features. CONCLUSIONS: All radiologic UICC/AJCC T4-defining features have worse outcomes compared to T3 disease, supporting their retention within the T4 category. Among T4 cases, worse outcomes were observed in cases with deep tongue muscle invasion (genioglossus) and nasopharyngeal extension.</description>

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants and incidence of laryngeal cancer. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were conducted from inception to 01/06/2024. Eligible studies included observational and ecological designs reporting quantitative associations between ambient pollutants and laryngeal cancer incidence. Study quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty graded were appraised using the NIH tool, National Toxicology Program framework and GRADE approach respectively. A total of nine studies (4 ecological, 5 cohort) comprising over 7.4 million participants were included. Each pollutant was analysed by a maximum of 3 studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) demonstrated the most consistent association with laryngeal cancer, with hazard ratios between 1.18 and 1.24 per 10 μg/m³ increase. One large cohort reported a significant relationship between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and laryngeal cancer (HR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.2-2.85), while findings across other pollutants, including PM₁₀, SO₂, O₃, CO, and NOₓ, were inconsistent. Although data remain limited, emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to ambient NO₂ and PM₂.₅ may increase laryngeal cancer risk. Future large-scale prospective cohort studies with standardized exposure metrics and robust confounding control are needed to better characterise this relationship. Natural experiments in regions undergoing major air-quality policy changes can provide valuable evidence on the impact of reducing exposure on laryngeal cancer incidence at a population level.</description>

The study aimed to identify the roles of FOXO1, hsa-miR-96-5p, and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 in the molecular pathogenesis of LSCC patients based on the systems biology data. METHODS: The LSCC patient tissue samples (n = 50) and the same individual's adjacent normal tissues (n = 50) were collected from the candidates (aged 57.75 ± 9.3 years) of surgery. The miR-96-5p and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 were predicted using the specific servers. The Kaplan Meier analysis was employed using TCGA data. The FOXO1and ncRNA gene expression levels were measured with the RT-qPCR technique. The Western blot technique was applied to estimate FOXO1/pFOXO1 protein values. RESULTS: A FOXO1/miR-96-5p/ADAMTS9-AS2 gene network was constructed and enriched using the bioinformatics data. The FOXO1 (p 0.037) correlated with ADAMTS9-AS2 (p 0.04) gene expression levels and was reduced in the LSCC patient tissue samples despite the elevated miR-96-5p expression levels (p 0.047). Moreover, the FOXO1 (p &lt; 0.01) and pFOXO1 (p &lt; 0.0001) protein values were reduced in the LSCC. The high FOXO1 and ADAMTS9-AS2 gene expression levels significantly increased the survival probability (HR 0.61 and 0.65, respectively). CONCLUSION: The FOXO1 and ADAMTS9-AS2 genes might act as molecular suppressors in the cell growth pathways. Furthermore, miR-96-5p is suggested as an oncogenic miRNA in the LSCC.</description>

We applied an automated artificial intelligence (AI) imaging platform integrating lymph node autosegmentation with ENE prediction to determine the prognostic value of the number of predicted ENE nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multisite, retrospective study of 1,733 OPC patients with pretreatment computed tomography who underwent definitive radiation therapy across three institutions. Malignant lymph nodes were segmented using a validated deep learning auto-segmentation model, and segmented lymph nodes were sequentially processed with a validated ENE prediction model to calculate number of nodes with AI-predicted ENE (AI-ENE) per patient. We evaluated associations of AI-ENE with disease outcomes using site-stratified, multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for human papillomavirus (HPV) status, smoking pack-years, tumor and nodal stage, age, and sex. We evaluated risk-stratification improvement when incorporating AI-ENE into the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 risk groupings and derived American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging with Uno C-indices and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: Overall, median AI-ENE node number was 1 (range, 0-6). AI-ENE node number was independently associated with poorer distant control (DC; hazard ratio [HR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.69]; P &lt; .001) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.46]; P &lt; .001). Increasing AI-ENE node number was incrementally associated with worse outcome, particularly DC (P &lt; .001). C-indices improved in the external data set when incorporating AI-ENE into RTOG-0129 groupings (OS: 0.70 v 0.65; DC: 0.65 v 0.57) and AJCC-8 stage (OS: 0.75 v 0.70; DC: 0.72 v 0.67; P &lt; .001 for each). The largest improvements were observed among HPV-negative patients (C-index: +15% for OS, +14% for DC). CONCLUSION: Automated, AI-ENE node number is a novel risk factor for OPC that may better inform pretreatment risk stratification and decision-making.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different management strategies (endoscopic vs. open). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study who developed laryngeal stenosis following partial laryngectomy for LSCC between December 2011 and December 2023. Patient demographics, etiological factors, and therapeutic interventions were systematically analyzed to evaluate clinical outcomes and summarize management experience. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 61 patients (4 females, 57 males) aged 25-77 years old. The overall decannulation rate was 52.5% (32/61). Endoscopic treatments included laser, balloon dilation and laser combined with balloon dilation, with a decannulation rate of 64.71%, 33.3%, and 45.45%, respectively. Of the 45 patients who received a single endoscopic treatment, successful decannulation was achieved in 25 cases (55.6%), while among the 11 patients that received multiple endoscopic treatment, only 3 (27.3%) patients attained successful decannulation. In contrast, open laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) with T-tube placement showed superior outcomes, with an 80% (4/5) decannulation rate. Among the 61 patients with laryngeal stenosis, those who underwent endoscopic treatment did not require postoperative nasogastric feeding, and their postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter compared to those who underwent LTR with T-tube. CONCLUSION: Laser-assisted endoscopic techniques is recommended as the initial treatment for laryngeal stenosis following partial laryngectomy due to its minimally invasive nature and faster recovery. However, for patients who fail initial endoscopic treatment, LTR with T-tube is often recommended due to its higher decannulation rate, rather than repeated endoscopic attempts.</description>

METHODS: Patients were stratified into the Preservation Group, Reconstruction Group, and Disconnection Group, retrospectively analyzed objective measures (from medical records and operative reports) and subjective measures (using the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System [SFGS] and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation [FaCE] scale) across the three patient groups. RESULTS: No significant differences in recurrence or mortality were observed between Reconstruction and Disconnection groups (p &gt; 0.05). Facial nerve reconstruction significantly improves outcomes in patients with high-risk parotid malignancies (p &lt; 0.05), despite higher-risk profiles in the reconstruction cohort. This improvement remained stable over time, showing no significant decline (p &gt; 0.05). Venous nerve conduit trap yielded superior facial nerve function and QoL versus end-to-end repair (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Facial nerve reconstruction effectively improves outcomes in parotid malignancy surgery. Venous nerve conduit trap application is better than end-to-end repair.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in surgically treated patients with primary oral cavity (OCSCC) or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 394 patients with OCSCC or LSCC who underwent surgery with curative intent. Preoperative blood samples were analyzed to assess platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, as well as T-cell subpopulations (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+). Composite ratios-including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII)-were evaluated for their correlation with global (GR), local (LR), and distant (DR) recurrence risk. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified elevated platelet counts, PLR, SII, and neutrophil levels as significantly associated with increased GR (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0014, p = 0.0058 and p = 0.016, respectively) and LR risk, with the exception of neutrophil levels (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0008, p = 0.0072, respectively). In contrast, higher CD4+/CD3+ (p = 0.038) and CD4+/CD8+ (p = 0.045) ratios were associated with reduced DR risk. Multivariate analysis confirmed platelet count as an independent predictor for GR (p = 0.0001) and LR (p = 0.0002), while a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio (p = 0.045) was independently protective against DR. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the prognostic relevance of platelet-related inflammatory markers and circulating T-cell ratios in recurrence risk among HNSCC patients. The differential associations with local versus distant recurrence underscore the complex interplay between systemic inflammation and adaptive immunity. Prospective validation is warranted to confirm these biomarkers' utility.</description>

In this study, we intended to explore aberrant alternative splicing (AS) as an important novel mechanism for the oncogenic inactivation of RASAL1 in thyroid cancer. Methods: We used comprehensive bioinformatic and molecular experimental approaches to identify and characterize aberrant alternative splice variants of RASAL1. This included structural and functional investigation of the potentially oncogenic splice variants of RASAL1, with a focus on exploring the molecular mechanisms and clinical impacts on thyroid cancer. Results: We identified an aberrant alternative splice variant of RASAL1, known as RASAL1-004, that commonly compromised the function of RASAL1 in thyroid cancer. Specifically, we found common skipping of exon 18.1 in RASAL1, leading to the abundant formation of transcript RASAL1-004 in cancer, which was significantly associated with poor survival of patients with thyroid cancer. Mechanistically, Argonaute2 regulates exon 18.1 splicing by binding to the response element in exon 17 containing CCAGCC motif, promoting RASAL1-004 formation. The exon 18.1 skipping caused a conformational change in the RNA structure of RASAL1-004 at the junction of exons 17 and 18, resulting in ribosome stalling, halting RASAL1 translation. This reduced RAS GTPase-activating-like protein 1 (RASAL1 protein) synthesis, consequently leading to the functional loss of RASAL1. Compared with RASAL1-001, the canonical wild-type RASAL1 transcript, the absence of exon 18.1 in RASAL1-004 also conformationally altered the pleckstrin homology domain of RASAL1 protein, which, as we demonstrated, led to the loss of the ability of RASAL1 to localize with cell membrane, thereby impairing its RAS-inactivating function. We further demonstrated that compared with RASAL1-001, RASAL1-004 displayed impaired RAS-signaling pathway-suppressing and cancer cell-suppressing functions. Conclusions: This study identified a novel RASAL1-impairing mechanism, alternative to the classically known genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, for the inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene RASAL1 through aberrant AS to form RASAL1-004 with impaired protein translation. This represents a new oncogenic mechanism in thyroid cancer, with novel cancer biological, prognostic, and therapeutic-targeting implications in thyroid cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bourhis J, Aupérin A, Borel C, Lefebvre G, Racadot S, Geoffrois L, Sun XS, Saada E, Cirauqui B, Rutkowski T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41448222/'&gt;41448222&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Postoperative cisplatin and radiotherapy is the standard of care for high-risk resected locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). The NIVOPOST-OP trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of programmed death 1 blockade by nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in this setting. METHODS: This open-label, phase 3 trial evaluated adding nivolumab to cisplatin and radiotherapy after surgery for LA-SCCHN with high-risk pathological features. The main inclusion criteria were age 19-74 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx resected with macroscopic complete resection, and at least one high-risk pathological feature: nodal extracapsular extension, microscopically positive margins, four or more cervical nodal involvements without extracapsular extension, and multiple perineural invasions. 680 participants recruited in 82 sites across six countries (France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive cisplatin and radiotherapy (66 Gy, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks, for three cycles); or nivolumab 240 mg intravenously, followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy with three cycles of concomitant nivolumab 360 mg once every 3 weeks, and six cycles of adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg once every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival as per investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population. 230 disease-free survival events (relapses or deaths) were required to detect a hazard ratio of 0·65 with 0·05 two-sided α error, with 90% power. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03576417) and is active, but not recruiting. FINDINGS: The 680 patients were recruited from Oct 15, 2018, to July 3, 2024. The analysis was based on 666 participants randomly assigned until the cutoff date (April 30, 2024), at which point the required number of events was reached (median follow-up 30·3 months). Disease-free survival was significantly improved with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy versus cisplatin and radiotherapy alone, irrespective of programmed death ligand 1 expression (HR 0·76; 95% CI 0·60-0·98; stratified log-rank test p value=0·034). There was an increase in the rate of participants with treatment-related grade 4 adverse events with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy compared with cisplatin and radiotherapy (30 [10%] of 312 vs 16 [5%] of 306). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two participants in each group. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in high-risk resected LA-SCCHN improves disease-free survival with moderate toxic effect increase, and can be proposed as a new standard treatment.

However, recent evidence suggests that in selected patients, hemithyroidectomy (HT) may offer comparable oncologic outcomes. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of occult contralateral disease and to identify clinicopathological factors associated with disease-free survival (DFS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all surgical patients with sMTC at a tertiary academic center (2013-2025), excluding patients with hereditary MTC, RET mutations, or clinical evidence of MEN2. Kaplan-Meier analysis with logrank testing was used to identify predictors of DFS. RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were included (66.7% female, median age 60.5 years). TT was performed in 44 patients (91.7%). Bilateral disease was present in five patients (11.4%), all detected on preoperative ultrasound. No cases of occult contralateral disease were found. During a median follow-up of 3.4 years, seven patients (14.6%) experienced recurrence. Advanced T stage, nodal involvement, distant metastases, lymphatic and vascular invasion, extracapsular extension, and male sex were all significantly associated with reduced DFS (all p &lt; 0.05). Persistent postoperative calcitonin elevation (&gt; 2 pg/mL) strongly predicted recurrence (p &lt; 0.001), whereas baseline calcitonin &gt; 500 pg/mL did not. CONCLUSION: Occult contralateral disease in sMTC is rare when high-quality preoperative ultrasound is available. In selected patients with unifocal, node-negative tumors and favorable pathology, HT combined with structured calcitonin monitoring may be an oncologically safe, less morbid alternative. These findings support individualized, risk-adapted surgical strategies in sMTC. Prospective validation is warranted.</description>

Currently, there is no universally accepted treatment approach, but both conservative and surgical management options have been proposed. We present the outcomes of surgically treated cases and propose our surgical strategy for complete management. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to identify temporal bone ORN cases that were primarily treated surgically at two centres between 2005 and January 2025. We recorded and analysed patients' demographics, the anatomic site of the primary tumors and assessed hearing and other postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of ORN of the temporal bone have been identified. Management for these cases varied: six were treated with canaloplasty, two had mastoidectomy with reconstruction, three had lateral temporal bone resection with blind sac closure, three were treated with petrosectomy and blind sac closure. The mean age at diagnosis was 63 years, and half of the cases involved males. The most common site of the primary tumor that received RT was the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Surgery is an effective management option for recalcitrant temporal bone ORN. The surgical strategy for temporal bone ORN is guided by disease extent and hearing status. As there are no standardised recommendations for its management, future research is necessary.</description>

This review aims to examine the effects of exercise and physiotherapy interventions on various outcomes in individuals who have undergone HNC surgery. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published within the past decade, yielding 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. RESULTS: Except for one preoperative instruction session, all interventions were implemented postoperatively. The most frequently evaluated outcomes included shoulder, jaw, and swallowing function, as well as postoperative symptoms. Across studies, exercise programs with varying content consistently improved shoulder mobility, swallowing function, and symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Evidence from current studies demonstrates that exercise interventions contribute to improved functional outcomes and reduced symptom burden, supporting their inclusion as a core component of standard care in patients who have undergone head and neck cancer surgery.</description>

METHODS: We established an open-source pipeline to quantify vascular area (VA) in both the inner tumor (InT) and invasive tumor front (ITF) regions from CD31-stained whole-slide images (discovery cohort, n = 66). The associations between VA and patient survival were assessed via univariate and multivariate analyses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort (n = 70) immunostained with CD34. RESULTS: VA was significantly higher in the InT region compared to the ITF (p = 0.0079). A higher VA in the ITF was independently associated with favorable overall survival (discovery: HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.73, p = 0.009; validation: HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.47, p &lt; 0.001) and disease-free survival (discovery: HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.81, p = 0.015; validation: HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.53, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide the first evidence that high VA in the ITF is associated with a better prognosis in OSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

METHODS: This study enrolled patients with OSCC from 2000 to 2020, and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model examined the risk factors on survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 885 OSCC patients were included, with the most common tumor subsites: oral tongue (41.9%), gingiva (31.8%), and floor of mouth (16.0%). Gingival and floor of mouth showed a higher proportion of advanced stage (65.8%, 66.9%) and significantly poorer OS (3-year: 63.0%, 57.0%; 5-year: 49.8%, 37.3%) and RFS (3-year: 59.1%, 61.3%; 5-year: 55.5%, 57.0%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly reduced mortality in gingival cancer (HR = 0.598), while tobacco exposure (HR = 1.952) was associated with a significant increase in mortality in floor of mouth cancer. CONCLUSION: Gingival cancer and floor of mouth cancer have a worse prognosis, and thus require greater attention throughout the entire management process.</description>

However, their functional contribution to tumor progression remains unclear. METHODS: We identified and characterized a subset of mitotically active (MA)-PGCCs in human oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens and cell lines. Mitotic activity and cell cycle was assessed using immunofluorescence, time-lapse microscopy and FUCCI. We evaluated the interactions between MA-PGCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), focusing on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed using cell viability assays. RESULTS: MA-PGCCs exhibited both bipolar and multipolar mitosis, generating heterogeneous progeny that contributed to genomic instability. These cells increased the number of CAFs with elevated TGF-β expression, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing resistance to 5-FU. Mechanistically, enhanced reactive oxygen species in MA-PGCCs upregulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR, promoting plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β secreted from adjacent CAFs. Upregulation of TGF-β receptors in MA-PGCCs further amplified TGF-β signaling, accelerating EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify MA-PGCCs as a proliferative subpopulation that promotes EMT and chemoresistance through a TGF-β-uPA/uPAR feedback loop. Targeting this pathway may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive tumors enriched in MA-PGCCs.</description>

While increasingly used, evidence in oncologic populations remains limited. Our objective was to review JIAD in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and its outcomes. METHODS: Our systematic review was conducted following a predefined protocol (PROSPERO CRD420251043510). Our search strategy was executed on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from January 2013 to October 2025. Studies with HNC patients of all ages who underwent JIAD were included. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies were included with 57 patients. Common tumour characteristics included mandibular location (n = 31; 54.4 %) and squamous cell carcinoma pathology (n = 37; 64.9 %). A fibular free flap was used in all cases (n = 57; 100 %). Majority underwent adjuvant therapy (n = 36; 63.2 %). Prosthesis survival was reported in 6 studies (n = 25/32; 78.1 %) with follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 52 months. Prosthesis removal was commonly due to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (n = 6; 10.5 %). All irradiated implants had successful early osseointegration (n = 99; 100 %). Delayed implant failure was reported in 4 patients (n = 4/36; 11.1 %) with 11 implants in radiotherapy field (n = 11/99; 11.1 %). CONCLUSION: JIAD for HNC patients can have high success in majority of select patients/defects. Although early osseointegration rates were high, oncologic patients receiving adjuvant radiation may remain at elevated risk for ORN-associated prosthesis failure. As such, the risks and benefits of JIAD should be carefully reviewed with the patient, and cancer staging should also be considered.</description>

METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD. Proactive adherence-supporting factors facilitate high adherence in this population. Both real and sham HD-tDCS proved safe, feasible, and well tolerated.

Proton conformal FLASH treatment aims to deliver pencil beam scanning (PBS) Bragg Peaks to the tumor region with UHDR. In this work, we conducted a treatment planning study for head and neck (H&amp;N) re-irradiation patients using a research-version of a commercial TPS paired with conformal FLASH hardware integrated into a nozzle of a clinical cyclotron-based system. METHODS: Fifteen H&amp;N patients were planned for re-irradiation of 40 GyRBE in 5 fractions to the area of intact tumor. The TPS was configured with validated UHDR beam measurement to generate optimized patient FLASH plans with one or two beams, delivered as single-beam-per-fraction (SBPF). Each beam consists of a deliverable mono-energetic PBS map, a 3D-printable conformal energy modulator design, a selection of aluminum range shifter plates, and a brass aperture. Python scripts with machine-specific delivery timing parameters were used for Monte Carlo dose and dose rate calculations. Clinical VMAT and IMPT plans were also generated for dosimetric comparison. RESULTS: All plans met the tumor target and OAR planning objectives. Conformal FLASH plans showed very similar dose distributions to the clinical IMPT plans. Compared to VMAT plans, both IMPT and FLASH plans have reduced low dose region, maximum cord dose D0.03 cc (8.37 ± 0.94 vs. 3.19 ± 3.81 and 4.32 ± 3.12 GyRBE, respectively), contra-lateral parotid mean dose (1.88 ± 0.99 vs. 0.00 ± 0.01 and 0.00 ± 0.00 GyRBE, respectively) and contra-lateral submandibular gland mean dose (2.49 ± 1.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.13 and 0.19 ± 0.19 GyRBE, respectively). With 500 nA quasi-continuous nozzle beam current, the mean dose-averaged dose rate in CTVs of these 15 patients achieved 95.75 ± 22.78 Gy/s. CONCLUSIONS: We report the deliverable proton conformal FLASH treatment plans for H&amp;N re-irradiation patients using the innovative hardware configuration and measured beam data in our institution. The FLASH plans have very similar plan qualities to clinical IMPT proton plans and were deliverable with our proton machine. The machine specific 3D dose rate distribution can be calculated and displayed in the TPS.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS &gt; 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P &lt; 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P &lt; 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P &lt; 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P &lt; 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P&lt; .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools.</description>

The purpose of this study is to compare sociodemographic factors, main tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival rates between cancer patients managed within a prison hospitalization unit (PHU) and those treated in a community hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing 63 cancer patients from the PHU with 129 matched controls from the general population, matched by tumor type and age. Sociodemographic variables, risk factors, tumor types, treatment and survival were analyzed. Chi-square tests and Student's t tests were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were applied for survival analysis. The statistical significance level considered was 5% (SPSS v29). RESULTS: The prison population had a higher prevalence of smoking (74.6% vs. 60.5%), alcohol consumption (50.8% vs. 36.4%), and other substance use (25.4% vs. 14.7%) (p &lt; 0.001). The most common types of tumors were gastrointestinal (12%), prostate (9%), and head and neck (9%). Survival was lower for head/neck cancer patients in the PHU and higher in lung cancer patients (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated cancer patients presented a higher prevalence of risk factors but received similar oncological treatments compared to community controls. Survival was poorer for head and neck cancers and unexpectedly better for lung cancer, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. The integrated prison-hospital model may reduce treatment disparities, but barriers to early diagnosis and follow-up remain.</description>

Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive biomarker able to improve early detection, assess minimal residual disease, monitor systemic treatment response and identify therapeutic targets. This literature review aims to critically synthesise evidence from the past decade on the clinical use of ctDNA in both HPV-related and HPV-unrelated HNCs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed and Cochrane Library on March 11th 2024, updated on November 21st, 2025, using the keywords: "circulating tumour DNA", "head and neck cancer", "ctHPV-DNA associated with HNSCC", "liquid biopsy and HNSCC". RESULTS: After evaluation of 363 articles identified, 92 were included. ctDNA has been investigated for screening, diagnosis, prognostic stratification, treatment-response assessment, relapse detection and identification of therapeutic targets. However, performance varies considerably across studies due to methodological and biological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: ctDNA shows strong potential for response assessment and post-treatment monitoring, particularly in HPV-related disease. Nevertheless, its integration into clinical practice requires methodological standardisation and validation in larger prospective studies.</description>

But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.</description>

RAS mutations have been linked to thyroid cancer, although it is still unclear if they are useful as a pre-operative molecular screening for this particular subgroup. In order to assess the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, AUC, etc.) of RAS mutations in identifying malignancy among Bethesda IV nodules and to ascertain whether this can consistently direct clinical decision-making and minimize non-essential interventions, we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis using postoperative histopathology as the reference standard. METHODS: A literature search of the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and OVID databases was conducted. In all of the included studies, the diagnostic accuracy of RAS was compared with that of postoperative pathology, which was used as a standard. Data were pooled, and the sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated to estimate the accuracy of RAS. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included after screening, comprising 913 cases of Bethesda Category IV nodules. Among them, there were 246 malignant lesions and 667 benign lesions. The pooled sensitivity of RAS mutations was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.29-0.41), and the specificity was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.95). The positive likelihood ratio was 3.46 (95% CI, 1.94-6.18), the negative likelihood ratio was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60-0.89), and the AUC was 0.7954. Heterogeneity testing showed p&lt;0.05, I2 = 58.5%, indicating significant heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: RAS mutations have a moderate diagnostic value in the diagnosis of Bethesda Category IV thyroid nodules. Despite the presence of some heterogeneity, the detection of RAS mutations may be helpful in guiding clinical decision-making and management strategies.

This has prompted extensive research into biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes beyond conventional staging systems. This mini review summarizes findings from the existing literature to provide a comprehensive examination of the prognostic significance of malignancy and progression factors in OSCC, offering insights into future perspectives. There is clear evidence that molecular and protein-based biomarkers, in addition to established clinical and histopathological features, such as lymph node involvement, extranodal spread, and depth of invasion, strongly correlate with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Integrating different gene expression signatures, microRNA (miRNA) profiles, and changes in intracellular signaling pathways enables more differentiated risk stratification. Protein biomarkers such as cyclin D1, trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and E-cadherin have been shown to provide clinically useful prognostic information. These results underscore the importance of incorporating biomarkers into individualized risk stratification to enhance personalized treatment regimens and outcomes for OSCC patients. Currently, however, established clinical and histopathological parameters, as well as a limited number of validated molecular profiles, remain the most reliable prognostic indicators. While identifying new biomarkers is promising, establishing standardized protocols and implementing careful prospective validation are essential to ensuring their seamless integration into standard clinical practice.</description>

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer promise for nodal assessment, but clinical utility and reporting quality remain variable. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2020-2025. Eleven eligible studies (4 core, 7 supportive) addressed ENE (n=2) or LNM prediction (n=2), with additional supportive studies on segmentation, lymphatic spread modeling, MRI radiomics, and outcomes modeling. Extracted variables included study characteristics, performance metrics, validation, calibration, and unit of analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST; reporting quality was evaluated with TRIPOD. Due to heterogeneity and limited study numbers, no meta-analysis was performed; results were narratively synthesized. For ENE, we report study-level accuracy, decision-curve analysis (DCA), and per-1,000 management impact. RESULTS: All core studies were CT-based. The task-specific deep-learning ENE model achieved AUC 0.86 with balanced operating points, while the generalist LVLM (Large Vision-Language Model) reached sensitivity 1.00 with specificity 0.34. DCA favored the DL model across thresholds 0.10-0.40, showing fewer unnecessary dissections per 1,000 patients than Treat-all or L(V)LM. For LNM, discrimination was high (AUC 0.865-0.919), calibration was reported, and one study included external validation, though threshold-level sensitivity/specificity were missing. External validation was reported in 25% of core studies, calibration in 50%; TRIPOD adherence was 74.5% overall, with frequent under-reporting of blinding and missing-data handling. CONCLUSIONS: AI and radiomics show promising potential for preoperative prediction of ENE and LNM in oropharyngeal cancer. Task-specific deep-learning models achieve balanced discrimination, while generalist LVLMs provide high recall at lower specificity. For LNM, encouraging performance is reported, but limited external validation and absent standardized thresholds still preclude clinical use. Broader validation and harmonized reporting are essential before translation into practice. REGISTRATION/PROTOCOL: Not registered; methods followed PRISMA/TRIPOD/PROBAST guidance.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control study including clinical information and DNA samples from 792 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh dental clinics. The cases were 264 subjects diagnosed with oral potential malignant disorders or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Controls were matched by sex and age in a 1:2 ratio. χ2 tests detected differences between groups regarding ethnicity, race, and covariates. A Post-hoc test with Bonferroni and Holm corrections accounted for multiple comparisons between groups. A standard χ2 residual test was used to investigate which ethnicity category contributed most to the association. Multiple logistic regression models were used to obtain the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and to detect the association between single-nucleotide variants and outcomes, stratified by ethnicity and race. RESULTS: The risk of having the outcomes was 78% greater in those patients who self-reported as African American (OR, 1.78; P = .002; 95% confidence interval, 1.225-2.592). Minor allele G (rs9879992-GSK3B) increased the risk for the outcomes in patients who self-reported as African American (OR, 1.85; P = .002; 95% confidence interval, 1.236-2.772). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported race and ethnicity were associated with oral potential malignant disorder/oral cancer. Future studies using ancestry informative markers can confirm these findings.</description>

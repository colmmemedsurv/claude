      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dietz MS, Davis LE, Prasad PK, Campbell SR, Reith JD, Olsen MR, Kilpatrick SE, Ku JA, Silver NL, Park EP, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70273'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70273&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Mar-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41717876/'&gt;41717876&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gnathic osteosarcoma (OS), which includes mandibular and maxillary jaw OSs, account for 6%-9% of OS. Single-institutional and multi-institutional retrospective studies, as well as population-level databases, suggest that clinical differences exist among gnathic OS and OS of other sides, including other craniofacial OS. To date, no specific prospective studies of gnathic OS have been reported, and aspects of clinical management are controversial. Some elements of care are aligned with extragnathic OS, e.g., margin negative (R0) surgery, whereas others, such as chemotherapy and radiation, are not clearly defined. The authors reviewed the available literature for the diagnosis, treatment, and supportive/survivorship care patients with gnathic OS and offer consensus statements for the comprehensive management of this rare disease.</description>

We sought to identify clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with sustained attendance at an HNC Survivorship Clinic. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort of 625 HNC patients was divided into a subset of patients who received radiotherapy (n = 510) and patients who did not (n = 115). We defined sustained attendance as 1) the total number of visits that occurred before completing treatment and within three years post-treatment, and 2) adherence scores, calculated as the number of timeframes during which at least one visit occurred: pre-treatment completion (for the radiotherapy subset only) and one-, two-, and three-years post-treatment. We used Fisher's exact test for descriptive statistics and Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for sustained attendance. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 248 patients (39.7%) had only one visit to the Survivorship Clinic. In the radiotherapy subset, 211 patients (41.4%) had an adherence score of 1, compared to 81 (70.4%) in the non-radiotherapy subset. In adjusted analysis, treatment with radiotherapy was associated with more total visits (PR: 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.68), while greater neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation (PR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97) and farther distance from the Clinic (PR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95) were associated with fewer total visits. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and sociodemographic factors are independently associated with sustained attendance at an HNC Survivorship Clinic. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Disparities in engagement with HNC survivorship care highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve adherence to follow-up recommendations.</description>

Over the last decade, the aim to get a deeper understanding of how early experiences influence behavior later in life has led to an increased popularity of epigenetic studies. Several studies focused on negative childhood experiences, increased methylation at different oxytocin receptor gene sites, and deficits in social behavior in adolescence or adulthood. The current study focused on the role of parental behavior, personality, and methylation of the MT2 region in the oxytocin receptor gene on insecure attachment styles in young adulthood. A total number of N = 71 students (55 females, one non-binary) completed an online survey and provided cell material (buccal cell swaps) for methylation analysis. Parental behavior was measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), personality with the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and adult attachment with the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). Results showed a moderating effect of neuroticism on the relation between maternal care and methylation of the MT2 region: higher maternal care was associated with lower methylation levels but only among participants with low neuroticism scores. No association of methylation with anxious or avoidant attachment was observed and no effect of paternal care at all. The results emphasize the model of early environmental influences on behavior in respect to changing gene activity and will be discussed with respect to the MT2 region and early life experiences on the one, and the association with personality on the other hand.</description>

This study aimed to compute and evaluate medication adherence in its three process phases among T2D patients treated with oral antidiabetic (OAD) medications assessing association with main clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included newly diagnosed T2D patients initiating OAD therapy within 2015-2019 identified from the Nivel Primary Care Database (Nivel-PCD) in the Netherlands. Initiation was operationalised as ≥2 OAD prescriptions within follow-up. Implementation was quantified monthly using the Continuous Multiple-interval Measure of Medication Availability (CMA9). Group-based trajectory modelling (k-means via AdhereR) identified adherence patterns over 12 months. Persistence was assessed with a permissible-gap rule on the same 12-month series. Clinical measures (HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI) were evaluated at baseline and at 12 months, and HbA1c trends were analysed over time. RESULTS: Among 3,404 T2D patients started an OAD treatment, four distinct adherence clusters were identified: perfect adherence (70.1%), slow decline (13.3%), low adherence (10.6%), and slow increase (6.0%). Overall initiation was 99%. One-year persistence ranged from 26% (low adherence group) to 98.8% (perfect adherence group). Patients in the perfect-adherence group had higher baseline HbA1c but showed lower HbA1c and LDL levels over time compared with other groups. Blood pressure improved slightly in all groups. Changes in BMI were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence trajectories provide a dynamic view of patients' behaviour and are associated with better glycaemic and lipid control. High-risk patients were often in the perfect-adherence group and appeared to gain the highest clinical benefit. These results support routine adherence monitoring and targeted, trajectory-informed interventions in T2D care.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tran TV, O'Brien KM, Troisi R, Sandler DP, Kitahara CM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer causes &amp; control : CCC | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s10552-025-02085-1'&gt;10.1007/s10552-025-02085-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41718910/'&gt;41718910&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is more common in women than in men but the etiology is not well understood. We therefore investigated the association between childhood and adolescent factors and subsequent DTC incidence in women. METHODS: We used data from 47,913 women enrolled (2003-2009) in the U.S. nationwide Sister Study cohort who were cancer-free at baseline. We used Cox regression models to assess associations of DTC incidence with self-reported baseline characteristics, including perceived body size, hormonal, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors through age 20, adjusting for attained age (timescale), and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Over follow-up (median: 13.1 years), 239 DTC cases were identified. Factors associated with higher DTC incidence included being taller than peers at age 10 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.89), being lighter (HR = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.97-1.91) or heavier (HR = 1.28, 95%CI = 0.96-1.71) than peers during teen years, and ever not having enough to eat during childhood (HR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.15-2.43). DTC incidence was lower among those with childhood higher household educational level (HRBachelor's degree or higher vs high school, GED or less = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.55-1.03). We did not find notable associations for other factors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that childhood growth, nutrition, and socioeconomic factors may influence DTC incidence in women.</description>

This prospective, pilot implementation study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential clinical effectiveness of a novel student-led tele-EMST program for HNC survivors. METHODOLOGY: HNC survivors (n = 13) completed an eight-week tele-EMST program. Acceptability was measured using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability Questionnaire (TFAQ) and the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Feasibility was tracked weekly. Swallowing performance, airway clearance, and quality of life were evaluated using the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and SWAL-QoL, respectively. Data were collected with REDCap. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were performed. RESULTS: Acceptability of the tele-EMST program was high, as evidenced by high ratings on the TUQ (mean: 88.1/100%, SD: 16.3) and significant improvement on the TFAQ (p &lt; 0.05). Technical issues occurred in 24% of sessions but were all resolved. Swallowing performance (TWST, p &lt; 0.05), self-reported dysphagia symptoms, and mental health scores (SWAL-QoL, p = 0.03; p = 0.02) significantly improved. No significant changes in PEFR were observed (p = 0.59). CONCLUSION: The findings of this small pilot feasibility suggest that a student-led, tele-EMST program is a promising, scalable approach to reduce treatment inequities and support survivorship care for HNC survivors with dysphagia.</description>

While high-volume facilities (HVFs) enhance surgical outcomes, their survival benefit in ES-OCSCC has not been assessed in an updated large cohort. The role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predicting survival in this context is not well described. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed stage I and II OCSCC patients from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2020. Facilities were categorized by case volume into low-(&lt;2 cases/year), medium-(2-10), and high-volume (&gt;10). Hazards ratios estimated the impact of facility volume on OS, adjusting for clinical/surgical factors, and SDOH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves compared OS. RESULTS: Among 22,258 patients with ES-OSCC, 42.55% were treated at HVFs. PSMs rates were higher at LVFs (T1: 7.16%, T2: 13.63%) and MVFs (T1: 4.33%, T2: 7.56%) compared with HVFs (T1: 2.89%, T2: 4.74%). Treatment at LVFs was associated with higher odds of PSMs (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 2.34-3.37, p &lt; 0.001). Five-year OS was highest at HVFs (80.2%), followed by MVFs (77.1%) and LVFs (70.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Survival remained worse at LVF/MVFs among those with negative surgical margins (NSMs) or PSMs receiving RT/CRT. SDOH, including government insurance (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.27-3.17, p = 0.002) and proximity to treatment facility (OR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06-1.56, p = 0.01) increased PSM risk, while higher income (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.6-0.97, p = 0.03) was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Facility volume and SDOH influence PSM rates and OS in ES-OCSCC. Patients treated at HVFs experienced better outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved surgical quality metrics and centralization of care, even for ES-OCSCC.</description>

A total of 263 dentists from public and private institutions in Ankara, Türkiye, participated in the survey, which included a content-validated 36-item questionnaire covering demographic data, examination habits, knowledge of lesion features, biopsy practices, and educational experience. The data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations to explore associations between professional characteristics and clinical behaviors. While 78% of the participants acknowledged the dentist's role in reducing oral cancer mortality, only 17.5% reported performing routine oral cancer screenings. Biopsy practice was limited, with only 11% indicating that they had ever performed a biopsy, and 36.9% preferred to monitor lesions instead of referring them immediately. Experienced dentists were significantly more likely to examine their lymph nodes (p = 0.006) and conduct routine screenings (p &lt; 0.001). Although tobacco and alcohol use are widely recognized as risk factors, only 27.7% of the participants routinely examined high-risk anatomical areas. Patient education was reported by 92.4% of the participants, but brochures and visual aids were rarely used. Fewer than one-third of the participants rated their undergraduate training on oral cancer as sufficient, and most supported mandatory continuing education. The findings reveal considerable gaps in dentists' preparedness and implementation of early detection strategies despite high awareness levels. Strengthening diagnostic education in undergraduate programs and promoting structured continuing education may improve early detection efforts and reduce oral cancer-related morbidity and mortality.</description>

Nasogastric tube is an easy, efficient, and cost-effective method of management that could be a key to minimizing deaths from diarrheal disease. As such, this study assessed the current practices and barriers toward using nasogastric tube for managing moderate to severe dehydration in under-five children. PURPOSE: To assess the practices and barriers toward the management of moderate to severe dehydration using nasogastric tube in under-five children among health centers in Gamo Zone, South Ethiopia. METHODS: A qualitative study design was conducted among healthcare professionals at selected health centers in Gamo Zone. Data about the practice pattern of managing moderate to severe dehydration and barriers toward nasogastric tube utilization were obtained via in-depth interview. Data were reviewed using constant comparative analysis to identify emerging themes, and axial coding was performed to make connections between categories to organize themes into causal relationships. Hypotheses and concepts were developed inductively from the data. RESULTS: In our study, of thirty participants, 21 (70.0%) correctly diagnosed severe dehydration, while 9 (30.0%) diagnosed moderate dehydration. Among those who diagnosed severe dehydration, 5 (23.8%) recommended intravenous resuscitation, and 16 (76.2%) chose oral rehydration. After being informed of failed attempts, four chose to refer, and one clinician remained fixed on intravenous resuscitation, while the remaining 16 clinicians opted for nasogastric tube. Major challenges mentioned by the participants in managing dehydration were late presentation of the patients and equipment shortage. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study were aware of the significance of nasogastric tube for the treatment of moderate to severe dehydration. However, a gap in clinical skills, a lack of continuous training, high clinician turnover, and institutional policies limiting nasogastric tube utilization for the management of dehydration were major challenges. Therefore, improving clinicians' skills through continuous training and improving management protocol is essential in ensuring safe and effective rehydration and better patient outcomes.</description>

Prophylactic supplementation with calcium and calcitriol (C+C) is widely used, but selective administration based on early postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels may reduce overtreatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of symptomatic and biochemical hypocalcemia with routine prophylactic C+C and selective supplementation guided by postoperative PTH levels. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial conducted from June 1, 2022, to July 31, 2024, at 3 tertiary hospitals with adult patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign or malignant disease. Exclusion criteria included prior parathyroid surgery and calcium metabolism disorders. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2024, to March 30, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Selective supplementation when 4-hour postoperative PTH level was less than 15 pg/mL (PTH group; to convert to ng/L, multiply by 1) or routine prophylactic C+C for 15 days (C+C group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic hypocalcemia at 15 days postoperatively, assessed via a symptom scale. Secondary outcomes included biochemical hypocalcemia adverse events, calcium supplementation, and readmissions. RESULTS: The analysis included a total of 258 participants; the PTH group comprised 117 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [15.2] years; 100 women [85.5%]) and the C+C group, 141 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [15.9] years; 118 women [83.7%]). Bethesda III to VI nodules were present in 57 (48.7%) and 62 patients (44.0%), respectively. Symptomatic hypocalcemia occurred in 24 patients overall (9.3%), 11 (7.8%) in PTH group and 13 (11.1%) in C+C group (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.29-1.57; P = .36). In the subgroup with complete biochemical data, biochemical hypocalcemia was observed in 29 of 148 participants (16 in PTH [21.6%] and 13 in C+C [17.6%]) (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.57-2.93; P = .53). Adverse events and complications were similar across groups. The PTH group needed less calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that selective calcium supplementation based on postoperative PTH values was not superior to routine calcium supplementation for preventing symptomatic or biochemical hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy. Either strategy may be used, with choice depending on resource availability and clinical setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05252884.</description>

The prescribing patterns are largely unreported, and assessment of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with HNC is limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prescribing patterns of immunotherapy and the incidence and risk factors for irAEs using a claims-based database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of MarketScan Commercial and multistate Medicaid databases of all patients with HNC from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2022, was performed. Inclusion criteria were patients with HNC, defined by International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes with 6 months or longer of insurance enrollment prior to diagnosis and 1 or more months of follow-up. The databases excluded patients 65 years or older. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024. EXPOSURE: Prescription of an immunotherapeutic within 12 months after HNC diagnosis. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was prescribing rate of immunotherapeutics overall and per year. The relative use of each immunotherapeutic was also explored. Secondary outcome measures were incidence of irAEs, severe irAEs, and univariable/multivariate risk factors for irAEs. RESULTS: A total of 47 365 patients with HNC were included, and 2254 (4.8%) of these patients received immunotherapy. Overall, 32 195 participants were male individuals (68%) and 14 607 were female individuals (32%), with a mean (SD) age of 54 (9) years. The rate of immunotherapy prescriptions slightly increased over time from 2.3% of patients with HNC in 2017 to 2.8% in 2022 (percent change, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.9%). Following initial approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), prescribing patterns of pembrolizumab and nivolumab were similar, but divergence in 2019 led to 87% of the market share dominated by pembrolizumab by 2022. The 90-day overall irAE-rate was 41.2% and severe irAE rate was 2.7%. There was no association between medication use and irAEs. Comorbidity score was associated with severe irAEs at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03). Baseline hypothyroidism (adjusted OR [aOR], 6.7; 95% CI, 5.0-9.0) and liver disease (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7) were independently associated with the development of irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study found that pembrolizumab dominated the immunotherapy prescribing market, but the relative use of immunotherapy has minimally increased in patients younger than 65 years since FDA approval. irAEs were frequent and associated with key individual comorbidities. Severe irAEs were rare and associated with overall comorbidity status.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center and an affiliated private practice. METHODS: A retrospective review of Jaw-in-a-Day reconstructions performed between January 2023 and January 2024 was conducted. All patients undergoing fibula or scapula free flap reconstruction with immediate dental implantation and provisional prosthesis were included. Operative times and prosthetic workflows were compared by prosthesis capture method (in situ vs at the head) and team composition (single vs integrated two-surgeon teams). Outcomes measured were operative time, flap and implant survival, perioperative complications, Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores, and prosthesis use. RESULTS: 33 patients (median age 66; range 13-83) underwent Jaw-in-a-Day reconstruction, 20 malignant disease cases, and 13 benign or traumatic cases. Fibula free flaps were used in 32 cases and scapula in one. Median operative time was 12h19m. Prosthesis capture in situ trended toward shorter operative and prosthetic times but did not reach significance. The two-surgeon approach significantly reduced operative time by 4h24m (P &lt; .001) and prosthodontic time by 2 hours (P = .01). All flaps survived. Implant survival was 97%, with three failures in 2 patients. At 12 months, 32 patients used definitive prostheses and median FOIS was 7. CONCLUSION: The Jaw-in-a-Day surgical approach is feasible for benign and malignant reconstruction with high flap and implant survival. Early institutional adoption shows a learning curve, but efficiency improves with process refinements, particularly a two-surgeon workflow.</description>

In patients with cystinosis, cystine accumulates within lysosomes in all organs. The cystine-depleting agent cysteamine delays but does not prevent disease progression. METHODS: In this phase 1-2, open-label, ongoing clinical study, we performed a preliminary assessment of CTNS-RD-04, which consists of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying CTNS complementary DNA, in patients with cystinosis. The primary end points were the safety and the side-effect profiles of CTNS-RD-04. Secondary end points were measures of efficacy, including white-cell cystine levels and cystine storage depletion. Oral cysteamine was withdrawn before CTNS-RD-04 infusion, and cysteamine eyedrops were withdrawn 1 month after myeloablation. RESULTS: Six participants (20 to 46 years of age) received CTNS-RD-04 and were followed for 29 to 63 months. CTNS-RD-04 doses ranged from 3.63×106 to 9.59×106 CD34+ cells per kilogram of body weight, and vector copy numbers ranged from 0.59 to 2.91 copies per diploid genome. All the patients had sustained and highly polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution; vector copy numbers at 24 months ranged from 0.51 to 2.67 copies per diploid genome. A total of 217 adverse events occurred, most of which were mild or moderate in severity and largely consistent with the procedures and underlying disease. No evidence of monoclonal expansion was noted. White-cell cystine levels decreased from baseline except in Patient 4, who had the lowest vector copy number. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, CTNS-RD-04, an ex vivo gene therapy for cystinosis, had adverse effects that were largely consistent with the myeloablative regimen and underlying disease profile. White-cell cystine levels decreased after therapy. (Funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03897361.).</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The HYPNO (HYPo-fractionated vs NOrmo-fractionated radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) trial was designed as a multicenter, pragmatic, embedded, 2-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled noninferiority trial with dual primary endpoints, loco-regional tumor control, and grade 3 or higher late adverse events with a 10% noninferiority margin for both endpoints. The trial was open for enrollment in 12 centers, each adhering to their standard of care to the extent that it was consistent with the requirements of the trial protocol. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with 35 mg/m2 cisplatin weekly was permitted. RESULTS: Between March 2014 and February 2020, 792 patients were centrally randomized: 395 to HFX and 397 to NFX. Accrual closed, with all outcome data still blinded, with 792 of a planned 836 patients (94.7%) enrolled, in part due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The HYPNO test arm passed the separate noninferiority tests for both loco-regional tumor control (P = .04) and grade 3+ late adverse events (P = .004). At 3 years, the absolute difference in outcome between the 2 arms was ≤1.4 percentage points for overall survival, progression-free survival, loco-regional control, and grade 3+ late adverse events. The planned subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant heterogeneity of effect estimates for loco-regional control between the 2 trial arms. CONCLUSIONS: The HYPNO test arm schedule was shown to be noninferior with respect to both loco-regional tumor control and grade 3+ late adverse events.</description>

However, few studies have evaluated how embolization patterns and vascular features affect prognosis. METHODS: A 15-year retrospective review was performed on 44 patients with JNA undergoing surgery at one institution. Data included demographics, vascular supply, embolization techniques, surgical outcomes, and recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent PVE. Most tumors were embolized transarterially (93.0%) using polyvinyl alcohol-based agents (79.1%). The internal maxillary artery was most commonly embolized (93.0%). Internal carotid artery supply was present in 34.9%, and more than two vessels were embolized in 23.3%. Postembolization tumor blush occurred in 60.5%, with a median of 5% of the pre-embolization blush remaining after embolization. Neither internal carotid involvement, number of vessels embolized, nor residual blush significantly impacted operative time, surgical outcomes, or recurrence. CONCLUSION: With effective embolization, vascular complexity might not affect JNA resection outcomes. Multicenter studies are required to confirm those findings.</description>

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) measures SDoH based on 16 social factors. This study evaluates the impact of social vulnerability on the quality of life of those living with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: A retrospective cohort review of 657 patients at a single institution. CRS patients with cystic fibrosis, nasal obstruction, and nasal cancer were excluded. Baseline covariates, including SNOT-22 scores, sex, and history of surgery, were collected. SVI was calculated using the National Social Vulnerability Index 2020 Database by Census Tract. Statistical analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A lower SVI score was associated with lower SNOT-22 scores, independent of sex, presence of polyps, or history of surgery (p &lt; 0.001). Patients in the "Low to Medium" SVI category were significantly less likely to undergo surgery compared to those in other SVI categories (p = 0.04). Compared to patients with CRSwNP, those with CRSsNP had significantly worse SNOT-22 scores (p = 0.038) but no significant difference in SVI scores. Surgery was performed in 69% of patients with CRSsNP and 84% of those with CRSwNP. CONCLUSION: Social vulnerability impacts the likelihood of surgery and quality of life in patients with CRS. Higher vulnerability is associated with worse sinonasal symptoms, regardless of confounders. CRS patients with lower social vulnerability are less likely to have surgery. SNOT-22 scores did not influence the likelihood of surgery.</description>

Here we conducted an epidemiological and laboratory investigation to determine the etiology of the outbreak. Clinical data and specimens were prospectively collected from 108 individuals, of whom 59/108 (54.6%) were female. Children aged &lt;5 years were the most affected (47/108, 43.5%); 14/32 (43.7%) were malnourished. Oro/nasopharyngeal swabs from 96/108 individuals were PCR tested; 26 blood samples were sequenced. Plasmodium falciparum was detected in 56/108 (51.8%) individuals. Co-infections were also detected, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 16/56 (28.6%) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 10/56 (17.9%) individuals. No novel pathogens were detected via metagenomics. Our findings suggest that the outbreak was primarily associated with a surge in malaria cases, with concurrent viral respiratory infections. Increasing decentralized laboratory capacity and strengthening broader health systems remain crucial for faster outbreak detection and investigation.</description>

However, the failure to accurately recognize an oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD) or the misdiagnosis of a benign lesion can lead to diagnostic delays with significant impact on the patient's health. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis compared to the histopathological diagnosis, focusing on OPMDs and suspected benign lesions in an Italian university hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with a clinical diagnosis of benign lesions or OPMDs at the Oral Medicine and Pathology Unit (Maggiore Hospital, Trieste, Italy). Expert clinicians performed the clinical assessment, followed by biopsy and histopathological analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated through sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient was used to determine concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses. RESULTS: The histopathological analysis diagnosed the presence of benign lesions in 74.7% of cases and OPMDs in 25.3%. Sensitivity was highest for odontogenic cysts and tumors (92.06%) and lowest for ulcerative lesions/TUGSE (37.50%). Specificity exceeded 95% across most considered categories. The overall concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses was substantial (κ = 0.70). CONCLUSION: The misdiagnosis of OPMDs or benign lesions leads to diagnostic delays which seriously impact on the patient's therapeutic process. This survey highlights both high diagnostic accuracy and strong concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses. Integrating advanced diagnostic tools and constant clinicians' training is essential to minimize misdiagnoses.</description>

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized trial involving persons with HIV who had inadequate adherence to ART (a persistent HIV-1 RNA level of &gt;200 copies per milliliter or loss to follow-up). Participants received up to 24 weeks of adherence support, conditional economic incentives, and standard care with oral ART (step 1). Participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 200 copies per milliliter or lower in step 1 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either continue standard care or switch to monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine with or without oral lead-in therapy (step 2). The primary outcome was regimen failure, defined as confirmed virologic failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements of &gt;200 copies per milliliter) or treatment discontinuation during step 2. RESULTS: In step 1 of the trial, we enrolled 453 participants; the median age was 40 years, 63% were Black, and 29% had been assigned female sex at birth. In step 2, a total of 306 participants underwent randomization; 152 were assigned to receive cabotegravir-rilpivirine and 154 to receive standard care. Step 2 randomization was stopped early on the basis of the superiority of cabotegravir-rilpivirine to standard care in secondary outcomes at a prespecified analysis performed after a median follow-up of 48 weeks. The cumulative incidence of regimen failure by week 48 was 22.8% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 41.2% in the standard-care group (difference, -18.4 percentage points; 98.4% confidence interval [CI], -32.4 to -4.3; P = 0.002). The cumulative incidence of an adverse event was 43.5% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 42.4% in the standard-care group (difference, 1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -12.7 to 15.0). Resistance-associated mutations developed in 2 participants with confirmed virologic failure in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir-rilpivirine were superior to standard oral ART in reducing the risk of regimen failure among persons with HIV who had adherence challenges.

This study aimed to investigate prophylactic effects of naldemedine on OINV in patients initiating regular, oral, strong opioids for cancer pain. METHODS: In this preplanned secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the preventive effects of naldemedine on OIC, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either naldemedine 0.2 mg or placebo once daily for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate, defined as the proportion of patients with no vomiting episodes and no use of rescue antiemetics within the first three days of opioid initiation. The secondary endpoint was the nausea and vomiting score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL). RESULTS: Of the 103 patients, 48 and 47 patients in each group started protocol treatment, respectively. The CR rate was significantly higher in the naldemedine group than in the placebo group (81.3% vs. 38.3%, P &lt; 0.001). Nausea and vomiting scores on the QLQ-C15-PAL at weeks 1 and 2 were significantly better in the naldemedine group (means 7.1 and 6.4) versus placebo (means 44.6 and 35.3; both P&lt;.001). Within the total effect of naldemedine on the QLQ-C15-PAL nausea and vomiting scores at week 2, the proportion mediated through OIC reduction was 21.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Naldemedine may have intrinsic antiemetic potency to prevent both OIC and OINV.

This study evaluated the risk of long-term morbidities in thyroid cancer patients who developed permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism (PO-hypoPT), compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using South Korea's nationwide claims data encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Among 217,156 thyroid cancer patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 2013 to 2020, 15,592 patients with PO-hypoPT and 27,906 matched controls with preserved parathyroid function were identified after 1:2 propensity score (PS) matching. Long-term morbidities associated with hypoPT included nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression. Hazard ratios (HRs) for these morbidities were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after large-scale PS matching. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration in both groups was approximately 5 years. Patients with PO-hypoPT had a significantly higher risk of nephrolithiasis (HR 1.17, confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.30), renal insufficiency (HR 1.75, [CI 1.50-2.03]), and MACE (HR 1.10, [CI 1.01-1.19]) compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. However, the risks of other long-term morbidities, including seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression, were not significantly different between the two groups. The association between PO-hypoPT and renal insufficiency remained consistent across all subgroups stratified by sex, age, and duration of calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: PO-hypoPT in thyroid cancer patients is associated with increased long-term morbidity, particularly renal and cardiovascular complications. Long-term monitoring of renal function and cardiovascular health is warranted in this population.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia risk, handgrip strength, and swallowing function in patients with dysphagia undergoing Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A tertiary dysphagia clinic. METHODS: Medical records of individuals aged 65 years and older who attended the dysphagia clinic over a 6-month period were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, clinical symptoms, handgrip strength, SARC-F (Strength, Assistance in walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, and Falls) scores, Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) scores, and Yale residue scale scores from FEES. Critically weak grip strength was defined using previously established thresholds. Correlations between sarcopenia indicators and swallowing outcomes were analyzed using Spearman's rho. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included (mean age 77.6 ± 7.5 years; 52% male). Twenty-five (76%) demonstrated critically weak grip strength, and 9 (27%) had SARC-F ≥ 4, indicating sarcopenia risk. SARC-F scores were negatively correlated with Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) (rs = -0.45, P = .01) and positively correlated with liquid PAS (rs = 0.41, P = .02). Handgrip strength was negatively correlated with age (rs = -0.39, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most older adults undergoing FEES exhibited critically weak grip strength, suggesting high sarcopenia risk. Higher sarcopenia risk correlated with worse swallowing safety and reduced oral intake. These findings highlight the importance of assessing and addressing nutritional and muscle strength deficits in dysphagic older adults.</description>

This trial compared two commonly used radiation dose regimens in nCRT for resectable thoracic ESCC. METHODS: This single-center, phase II prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with locally advanced thoracic ESCC from February 22, 2018 to February 22, 2021. Patient were randomized 1:1 to receive nCRT with either 50.4Gy/28F or 41.4Gy/23F, concurrent with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were randomized (50.4 Gy, n=72; 41.4 Gy, n=75), of whom 101 underwent surgical resection., Pathological complete response occurred in 23 of 46 patients (50.0%) in the 50.4-Gy group and 18 of 55 patients (32.7%) in the 41.4-Gy group (p=0.078). Using major pathological response (MPR) as an alternative endpoint, the 50.4Gy/28F regimen significantly increased the MPR rate to 73.9%, compared to 52.7% in the low-dose group (p=0.029). In the intention-to-treat population analysis, the 2-year PFS rates were 56.7% for the high-dose group and 49.3% for the low-dose group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.46-1.11, p=0.14). Two-year OS rates were similar between groups. Grade ≥2 radiation esophagitis occurred more frequently in the 50.4-Gy group, while postoperative complication rates were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Dose escalation from 41.4 to 50.4 Gy in nCRT for resectable ESCC did not improve PFS or OS but was associated with a higher MPR rate and increased esophagitis. These findings support current evidence that routine dose escalation does not confer a survival advantage, while providing randomized ESCC-specific data to inform individualized treatment decisions.</description>

In Egypt, where cultural and religious norms shape health perceptions, HPV prevention, especially vaccination, remains a critical public health issue. This study investigates parental knowledge and attitudes towards HPV infection and vaccination in Egypt, focusing on the influence of cultural and religious beliefs. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to April 2024 among 776 Egyptian parents. Participants were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling methods. A comprehensive questionnaire, translated and validated in Arabic, assessed knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer, beliefs about HPV vaccination, and vaccine acceptability. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 28, applying non-parametric tests to examine associations between demographic factors and study outcomes. RESULTS: While 38.5% of parents had heard of HPV, only 26.2% knew about the HPV vaccine. Higher education levels and income were significantly associated with better knowledge of HPV transmission and its link to cervical cancer. Cultural and religious factors played a pivotal role in shaping beliefs, with older and less educated parents showing lower levels of vaccine acceptance. Mothers were more willing than fathers to vaccinate themselves and their daughters, with willingness influenced by gender, age, and income. CONCLUSION: Parental awareness of HPV and its vaccine remains low in Egypt, with significant cultural and religious influences on health beliefs and behaviors. Tailored public health interventions addressing these factors are needed to improve HPV vaccine uptake and reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases in Egypt.</description>

We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate triage of women who are HPV-positive using dual stain (DS) and HPV genotyping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 9,645 consecutive women who are HPV-positive undergoing cervical screening in two periods between 2015 and 2017 in the organized cervical screening program at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Absolute risk and clinical performance of DS and cytology for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and greater (CIN3+) were estimated overall and by HPV genotype and by age. Cumulative absolute risk of CIN3+ was modeled over 5 years using a prevalence-incidence mixture model, which allows estimating risk accounting for differences in disease ascertainment, surveillance intervals, and compliance. RESULTS: The baseline risk of CIN3+ was 9.4% and 0.8% for women testing positive and negative for DS, respectively, and 6.9% and 2.0% for women testing positive and negative for cytology, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for CIN3+ detection were better for DS compared with cytology over 5 years (P &lt; .001 for all comparisons). Risk in women with HPV16-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy was substantially higher than the risk in women with HPV16-positive/DS-negative (7.5% v 2.9%, P &lt; .001). DS had better triage performance compared with cytology in all age groups and in women positive for HPV types other than HPV16 or HPV18. CONCLUSION: Long-term reassurance of low risk among DS negatives suggests that DS detects molecular changes earlier in the carcinogenic pathway than cytology. DS has better risk stratification than cytology overall, within HPV risk strata, and across all screening age groups and is a better option for triage of vaccinated populations.</description>

DNA methylation, a proven molecular biomarker for cancer classification, holds promise for stratifying thyroid cancer risk. The objectives were to determine the epigenetic hallmarks of pediatric thyroid carcinomas and to investigate whether DNA methylome profiling is a feasible approach for pre-operative risk stratification of this pediatric disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from two separately processed cohorts of pediatric thyroid carcinoma. The reference cohort included 100 samples, consisting of 87 well-differentiated primary tumors-77 papillary and 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas-and 13 matched lymph node metastases. To predict oncogenic drivers and tumor invasiveness, defined by the presence of nodal metastasis, we trained two classifiers on the reference cohort and then evaluated their performance on a second validation cohort of 84 samples, including 83 primary tumors and one lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We identified distinct methylation patterns associated with tumor invasiveness and key driver mutations, including BRAF p.V600E, RAS-like mutations, kinase fusions, and DICER1 mutations. The differentially methylated regions reflect inflammatory stress, disrupted thyroid development and function, implicating AR, Hippo, and AP-1 signaling. Leveraging these epigenetic signatures, we developed and validated two methylation-based classifiers that accurately predict tumor invasiveness and oncogenic mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric thyroid carcinoma patients, DNA methylation assays accurately predict tumor invasiveness and driver mutations. Our findings highlight the clinical value of DNA methylation profiling for risk stratification and classification of pediatric thyroid cancers.</description>

Still, hospitalization cannot be avoided in a substantial portion of patients and potential predictors of HF hospitalization (HFH) are eagerly awaited. AIM: We aimed to identify predictors of HFH after outpatient IV diuretic treatment for WHF, in order to improve the selection of patients who qualify for successful outpatient IV diuretic treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied WHF patients receiving intravenous diuretics in an outpatient day-care setting in one of two Dutch hospitals. A total of 366 patients from hospital A were used to identify predictors of 30-day HF (re-)hospitalization (HFH), which occurred in 88 (24.0%). Mean age was 76 years, 57% were male and 49% had ejection fraction below 40%. Age, eGFR, NT-proBNP, sodium, and haemoglobin were identified as predictors of HFH. The multivariable logistic regression model containing these factors had acceptable calibration and discrimination (AUC 0.73). The performance of the model was less favorable in the 127 patients from hospital B (29 patients with 30-day HFH), with AUC 0.65 and suboptimal calibration, indicating overestimation of risk. Doubling of NT-proBNP plasma levels and higher ambulatory oral loop diuretic dosages were strong predictors of mortality and HFH at 6 months in hospital A. CONCLUSION: In patients with WHF receiving outpatient day-care intravenous diuretic treatment, age, eGFR, NT-proBNP, sodium and haemoglobin predicted 30-day HFH. These factors may guide decisions on day-care treatment versus hospitalization, but require further validation Fig 2.</description>

CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used to block the CD47/SIRPa interaction that inhibits antigen-presenting cell phagocytosis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells, and have shown promise in combination with anti-PD1 immunotherapy in tumors, including recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We found that CD47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and explored the anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD47 fusion protein in combination with anti-PD1 and lymphatic-sparing radiotherapy in a locally advanced HNSCC model. In the 4MOSC1 syngeneic HPV-negative HNSCC mouse model, ALX301 (an engineered CD47-blocking SIRPα fusion for murine models) induced complete tumor regression when combined with anti-PD-1, and produced a partial tumor response as a monotherapy. An anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in a CD47-null tumor background led to complete tumor regression confirming a key role for CD47 in tumor immunity. ALX301 treated mice demonstrated increased MHC-II expression on dendritic cells within the tumor and upregulation of CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on dendritic cells within the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes, and contralateral lymph nodes. Combination ALX301 and anti-PD1 treatment in an anti-PD1 resistant 4MOSC2 model demonstrated significant tumor regression, enhanced survivability, improved response with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and greater retention of CD8 + T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, T-cell receptor sequencing revealed increased shared clonality between the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes of ALX301 treated mice. These data demonstrate that a combination of CD47 blockade and anti-PD1 therapy enhances tumor antigen presentation and immune cell infiltration, while further improving anti-tumor responses in combination with tumor-targeted radiotherapy. This study provides support for the rational design of combinatorial immunoradiotherapy, using anti-CD47 inhibitors and anti-PD1 therapy, in a clinical trial targeting locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.</description>

However, the optimal therapeutic parameters remain undefined. This prospective study aimed to compare the efficacy of two distinct intralesional bevacizumab administration protocols following surgical resection of RRP. METHODS: Between 15/09/2023 and 31/12/2024, adult patients with RRP were enrolled in a prospective research study. Participants were allocated to one of two bevacizumab administration protocols, delivered intralesional during direct microlaryngoscopy and CO₂ laser excision. Disease severity was assessed using the Derkay, Dikkers and Numerical scoring systems, as well as the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), at baseline and at 8-week intervals. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens were associated with reduction in disease burden and improved voice outcomes. No statistically significant differences in disease control were observed between the two administration protocols. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that both dosing regimens of bevacizumab were effective as an adjunctive therapy of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The higher intralesional doses of bevacizumab are relatively safe and well tolerated in adult patients with laryngeal RRP. Further studies with extended follow-up are warranted to define long-term efficacy and optimal dosing strategies.</description>

This study examined whether the number of remaining teeth mediates the association between age and oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) risk. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 413 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 60 years) recruited from community health centers in Sulawesi, Indonesia. OD risk was assessed using a validated screening questionnaire. Oral examinations were conducted by trained nurses. Mediation analysis estimated the indirect, direct, and total effects of age on OD risk, adjusting for sex, educational level, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 69.9 years, with 15.3 remaining teeth. Mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect association between age and OD risk, mediated through the number of remaining teeth (adjusted β = 0.076, 95% CI: 0.034-0.114, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the direct effect of age was not statistically significant. The total effect of age on OD risk remained significant. CONCLUSION: The number of remaining teeth statistically mediated the association between age and OD risk. Although causal inference is limited by the cross-sectional design, these findings highlight oral health as a potentially modifiable factor for reducing OD risk among older adults.</description>

In this study, we addressed the effects of areca nut extract (ANE) on oral carcinogenesis by modulating fibroblast behavior in oral tissue. METHODS: Cell viability, migration, invasion, and flow cytometry assays were applied to study cell behaviors. Cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, phospho-kinase array, Western blot analysis, and oxygen consumption and glycolysis assays were performed to evaluate cell functions. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining using human and hamster oral tissues was applied to validate in vitro findings. RESULTS: Increased alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) were observed in fibroblasts from oral precancerous and cancer lesions. ANE increased mitochondrial metabolism in fibroblasts and induced myofibroblast transition. It enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion in fibroblasts. Conditioned medium from ANE-treated fibroblasts and recombinant GM-CSF increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and malignant transformation in dysplastic oral keratinocytes. In hamsters, ANE treatment increased GM-CSF expression in fibroblasts and EGFR phosphorylation in epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: ANE promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and GM-CSF secretion in fibroblasts, which activate EGFR signaling and malignant transformation of oral precancerous cells.</description>

However, data on the cost of cancer is scarce. This study estimated National Health Service (NHS) hospital care costs for eight cancer types by stage at diagnosis in England. METHODS: This national, retrospective, population-based cohort study used individual patient-level data collated by the National Disease Registration Service, NHS England. We included patients aged 50-79 years who were diagnosed with a colorectal, head and neck, liver and bile duct, lung, lymphoma, oesophageal, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer in England between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017. For each patient, we obtained linked national health-care records, incorporating all inpatient hospital care, outpatient activity, and accident and emergency department attendances, and costed these using a payer perspective. Patients were excluded if registration was death certificate only, records related only to a secondary metastatic site, sex and cancer type were incompatible, death status or date were uncertain, or there were zero health-care costs from 6 months before diagnosis to end of follow-up. Net, cancer-related, regression-adjusted hospital care costs were reported for each cancer type and stage overall, annually, and by phase of care. Within each annual period and phase, mean monthly costs were also estimated. FINDINGS: Of 359 106 cancer records registered, 345 629 cancers were available for analysis, and 333 657 cancers were included in the analysis (147 334 [44·2%] occurred in female patients and 186 323 [55·8%] in male patients; 303 227 [90·9%] among participants of White ethnicity, 4452 [1·3%] among participants of mixed or other ethnicity, 7870 [2·3%] among participants of Asian ethnicity, 4179 [1·3%] among participants of Black ethnicity, and 13 929 [4·2%] among participants of unknown ethnicity). Overall costs were higher at later stages for colorectal, head and neck, lymphoma, and ovarian cancers with mean stage IV costs of £37 838, £36 657, £42 667, and £45 871, respectively. Costs for liver and bile duct, lung, oesophageal, and pancreatic cancers were highest for those diagnosed at stage II (£28 356, £29 553, £33 640, and £39 351, respectively), and slightly lower at stages I, III, and IV. Health-care costs were highest in the initial treatment and the end-of-life phases of care. Within each phase, mean cost per month increased with stage for most cancer types studied, though fewer months of follow-up were observed in each phase for liver and bile duct, lung, oesophageal, and pancreatic cancers. INTERPRETATION: Cancer-related NHS hospital care costs by stage at diagnosis differed between cancer types; this heterogeneous pattern could inform detailed and nuanced economic evaluations of early detection initiatives.

However, its high toxicity and multiple fractions lead physicians to deliver tailored hypofractionated split-course radiotherapy (HSC-RT). The aim of the study was to compare these two radiotherapy methods in older patients. METHODS: This non-inferiority, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial was done in 30 treating centres (cancer centres, university and general hospitals, and private clinics) across France and Monaco. Patients aged 70 years or older, assessed as frail by geriatric evaluation, with stage II-IV head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma and in curative intent were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either SF-RT (70 Gy, 35 fractions over 7 weeks) or HSC-RT (55 Gy, 20 fractions, two courses of 2 weeks with 2 weeks stop). Randomisation was done by minimisation, and physicians and patients were not masked to the treatment group. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients alive with complete locoregional response at 6 months, analysed in all randomly assigned patients (intention-to-treat population). The non-inferiority margin was set at 16%. The study was sponsored by the Groupe d'Oncologie Radiothérapie Tête et Cou (GORTEC) and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01864850. FINDINGS: Between Oct 21, 2013, and Aug 22, 2018, 102 patients were randomly assigned to the HSC-RT group and 100 patients to the SF-RT group. One patient in the HSC-RT group refused treatment and follow-up and so was excluded, resulting in 101 patients in the HSC-RT group. Median age was 82 years (IQR 77-86); 145 (72%) were male and 56 (28%) were female. Median follow-up for overall survival was 56·6 months (IQR 41-69). In the intent-to-treat population, 35 (35%) of 101 patients were alive with complete locoregional response at 6 months in the HSC-RT group versus 33 (33%) of 100 patients in the SF-RT group (difference +2%, 95% CI -11 to 15). In the per-protocol population, 35 (36%) of 97 patients were alive with complete locoregional response at 6 months in the HSC-RT group versus 33 (35%) of 95 patients in the SF-RT group (difference +1%, -12 to 15). Median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 10·3 to 17·0) in the HSC-RT group versus 18·9 months (14·3 to 30·9) in the SF-RT group (hazard ratio 1·32, 95% CI 0·97 to 1·81). Eight patients died between radiotherapy start and 30 days after radiotherapy end (five [5%] in the HSC-RT group and three [3%] in the SF-RT group). One patient in the HSC-RT group had a grade 4 adverse event (kidney failure), as did four in the SF-RT group (two mucositis, one septic shock, and one hemiplegia). Acute adverse events grade 3-5 occurred in 33 (36%) of 91 patients in the HSC-RT group and in 44 (47%) of 93 patients in the SF-RT group (p=0·13; difference -11%, 95% CI -25 to 3). INTERPRETATION: Compared with SF-RT, HSC-RT did not decrease the 6-month complete locoregional response rate and could be an option for frail older patients. However, given the survival results, it should only be offered to patients deemed unsuitable for SF-RT after geriatric assessment.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cubero L, Acosta O, Pascau J, Palard-Novello X, Barateau A, Campillo-Giménez B, de Crevoisier R, Castelli J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707993/'&gt;41707993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Xerostomia is a common and debilitating toxicity following head and neck cancer (HNC) radiotherapy (RT). Although adaptive radiotherapy (ART) strategies can reduce mean parotid gland (PG) dose, clinical trials have shown limited benefit in reducing xerostomia, suggesting global dose metrics may be insufficient. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) enables assessing local dose-toxicity relationships and may identify symptom-related subregions (SRS) more predictive of toxicity. This study aimed to identify xerostomia-associated SRS using VBA and assess their relevance using a functional salivary atlas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy were randomized to receive standard RT or weekly ART. Xerostomia was assessed at 12 months post-treatment using stimulated salivary flow (SSF), with values ≤ 500 mg/min indicating xerostomia. A customized VBA was applied to identify subregions from voxel-wise dose differences between patients with and without xerostomia using a permutation test (planned dose in standard arm and accumulated dose in ART arm). To assess clinical relevance, a functional salivary atlas was generated from PSMA-PET/CT scans of 13 prostate cancer patients and compared with the subregions. A dosimetric analysis evaluated the predictive value of dose in overlapping regions. RESULTS: VBA identified a subregion (300.2 cc) with significantly higher doses in xerostomia patients, located contralaterally near the nasopharynx. Overlap with the functional PSMA-PET atlas revealed two clinically relevant subregions in the contralateral PG (SRSPG, 6.8cc) and tubarial gland (SRStubarial, 12.7 cc), with doses &gt; 11.5 Gy higher in xerostomia patients. Logistic regression models yielded high predictive performance, with maximum AUCs of 0.88 for SRSPG and 0.88 for SRStubarial. CONCLUSION: VBA revealed two predictive subregions-within the contralateral PG and tubarial glands-strongly associated with xerostomia at 12 months post-RT. Our findings offer a plausible explanation for the persistence of xerostomia despite PG sparing and support incorporating subregional dose metrics and tubarial gland sparing into RT planning.</description>

This project aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate a standardized screening process for frailty and malnutrition in a multidisciplinary head and neck cancer program to identify high-risk patients and inform treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a quality improvement initiative, a multidisciplinary team integrated the Risk Analysis Index for Cancer (RAI-C) for frailty and Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) into routine intake for new referrals of patients with head and neck cancer. Implementation was evaluated across three domains: feasibility, measured through completion rates, acceptability, assessed using clinician feedback via a survey, and impact on patient outcomes, using survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 585 eligible patients, 488 (83.4%) were successfully screened. The cohort (mean age 63.1 years, 64% male) demonstrated high frailty prevalence with 57.2% categorized as frail (RAI-C score ≥ 37) and 14.3% at risk for malnutrition (MST score ≥ 2). In multivariable analysis adjusted for tumor site, treatment intensity, and comorbidities, frail patients had a more than 3-fold increased mortality risk compared to non-frail patients (adjusted HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.50-6.30, p = 0.002). Similarly, malnourished patients showed a 2.8-fold increased mortality risk compared to non-malnourished patients (adjusted HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.52-5.03, p &lt; 0.001). Clinician feedback (n = 14) emphasized the value of screening in promoting "whole person" treatment planning, with suggestions for developing standardized pathways for interventions based on screening results. DISCUSSION: Implementing frailty and malnutrition screening in multidisciplinary head and neck cancer care is feasible, acceptable to clinicians, and identifies patients at significantly higher mortality risk. The strong association between screening results and survival validates these tools' clinical utility and supports their integration into routine practice. Future directions include developing a structured prehabilitation program targeted to modifiable risk factors identified through screening to potentially improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.</description>

However, the prognostic impact of the surgical extent remains inadequately characterized. This study evaluated the association between surgical approach and survival outcomes in T3b DTC. METHODS: We analyzed 6,920 T3b DTC patients (2004-2022) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (total thyroidectomy, n = 6,638; lobectomy, n = 282). Variable importance was assessed using SHAP values and permutation methods derived from Random Survival Forest models. The association between surgical approach and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Stratified survival analyses were performed by tumor size (≤20 mm, 20-40 mm, &gt;40 mm) and nodal status (N0, N1a, N1b). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using disease-specific survival as an alternative endpoint, with Fine-Gray models employed to account for competing non-thyroid cancer mortality. RESULTS: Variable importance analysis revealed that surgical approach minimally predicted outcomes (SHAP: 1.5%; permutation: 1.8%), ranking below age (43.1-55.8%), tumor size (21.2-22.2%), and nodal status (5.5-11.4%). Lobectomy showed equivalent survival to total thyroidectomy (adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68-1.37; 10-year OS 89.9% vs 89.6%, difference - 0.3%). Survival equivalence was consistent across all tumor size and nodal status subgroups, with favorable-risk patients (tumors ≤ 40 mm, N0) achieving disease-specific survival &gt; 96% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that surgical extent has minimal impact on survival in T3b DTC. Lobectomy may be an appropriate option for selected patients, supporting individualized rather than universal total thyroidectomy.</description>

Consistent and rigorous documentation is essential to evaluate this approach across disease sites. A system accounting for the complex anatomy of sinonasal tumors is currently lacking. We developed a framework to elucidate how neoadjuvant therapy impacts the extent and morbidity of surgery in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS AND RESULTS: A review of the medical literature highlighted a gap in research into response-adapted surgery for sinonasal malignancies. We developed a novel classification system to document resection at initial presentation and following neoadjuvant treatment. The framework is grounded in the surgical anatomy of the sinonasal region and weighs completeness with broad reproducibility to categorize adaptations according to (1) structures resected (2) exposure (3) reconstruction and (4) lymph node management. The surgical morbidity score was developed through a structured, iterative consensus process with a multidisciplinary expert panel. The final classification system was formally reviewed and endorsed by the institutional sinonasal tumor disease management team, establishing it as the standardized framework for documenting surgical outcomes in patients with SCC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system introduces the first response-adapted surgery classification to encompass patients with locoregionally advanced sinonasal SCC treated with neoadjuvant therapy prior to definitive surgical resection. By extending standardized terminology, this framework enhances communication within multidisciplinary teams, enables meaningful comparisons across published studies, and supports consistency in developing clinical trial endpoints seeking to balancing oncologic control and functional preservation.</description>

This study developed and validated the Ecotype-Integrated Response Model for HNSCC (EIRM-HN), integrating single-cell states, spatial transcriptomic niches, and bulk transcriptomes to derive immune ecotypes that stratify ICI outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective multi-cohort study analysed 370 HNSCC cases (80 molecular, 210 immunotherapies, 80 control) profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing. Immune ecotypes were derived from integrated single-cell and spatial features, converted into weighted gene signatures, and projected into bulk ICI cohorts to train penalised Cox and logistic models and compare performance against PD-L1, tumour mutational burden, and published signatures, with external prognostic validation in the GSE65858 bulk cohort. RESULTS: Among 210 ICI-treated patients, four ecotypes occurred at similar frequencies. The most suppressive ecotype showed low CD8+ T-cell abundance, high regulatory T-cell abundance, and increased stromal fraction, with median progression-free survival of 3.8 months and overall survival of 9.1 months, versus 9.8 and 20.3 months in the lymphoid-enriched ecotype. EIRM-HN achieved progression-free and overall survival concordance indices of 0.71 and 0.70, improving to 0.75 and 0.74 after adding clinical covariates, and exceeding PD-L1 and TMB. In GSE65858, overall survival concordance index was 0.67 with a hazard ratio of 1.89 for high- versus low-risk strata. CONCLUSION: An ecotype-based, spatially anchored risk model integrating single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomic data provides improved prognostic stratification of HNSCC relative to established biomarkers and generalises to an external bulk cohort.</description>

Preclinical studies demonstrated that low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (LDFRT) could potentiate chemotherapy, warranting further investigation. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial enrolled LANPC patients with advanced nodal stage (N2-N3 with necrosis, extranodal extension, or short axis ≥ 3 cm). Eligible patients were randomized to the LDFRT or control group. All patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The LDFRT group received 50 cGy radiation twice daily for 2 days targeting positive lymph nodes during each cycle of IC. The primary endpoint was the overall (nasopharynx and lymph nodes) objective response rate (ORR) after IC, with the secondary endpoints including 2-year survival outcomes and safety. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (41 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After IC, the LDFRT group demonstrated a significantly higher overall ORR (100% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.03) and numerically higher CR rate (14.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.11). The LDFRT group achieved greater median lymph node and total tumor volume regression compared to the control group (90.1% vs 53.91%; 77.1% vs 55.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). After a median follow-up of 26.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) showed trends favored LDFRT (87.6% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.17; 90.1% vs. 77.1%, p = 0.23, respectively). Acute toxicities were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk LANPC, LDFRT with IC improved ORR and tumor volume reduction, and was associated with a potential benefit in PFS and DMFS.</description>

This study compared costs of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and END from the Medicare payer perspective. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with T1-2N0M0 OCSCC (16 SLNB and 16 END) treated at an academic institution from 2017 to 2025 were included. RESULTS: 32 patients were included: median age 62, 46.9% male, 38% had adjuvant RT. The SLNB cohort had shorter operative time and length-of-stay. Four patients had reoperations: 2 after SLNB (completion neck dissection, tumor re-resection) and 2 after END (neck hematomas). The SLNB cohort had lower costs for postoperative admission ($9567 vs. $12 920, p = 0.015). Total costs were not statistically different ($19 777 vs. $22 126, p = 0.45). On break-even analysis, SLNB with a completion ND rate ≤ 35% had lower costs than END. CONCLUSIONS: Costs of SLNB were 10.6% less than END, and remained lower with completion ND rates ≤ 35%.</description>

Infant movement may also prolong the procedure. Automated computer vision (CV) assessment of video nasolaryngoscopy may improve diagnostic accuracy, shorten procedure time, and reduce infant discomfort. The aim was to develop a CV model to segment laryngeal anatomy, differentiate between normal and laryngomalacia cases, and classify laryngomalacia type (1, 2, or 3). METHODS: A total of 241 pediatric nasolaryngoscopy videos were obtained from The Hospital for Sick Children between August 2023 and March 2025 from participants &lt; 1 year old. Videos were annotated and randomly assigned to a training set [192 (80%)] and testing set [49 (20%)]. Three binary classification models (fine-tuned for feature extraction) were developed to predict laryngomalacia and classify its type. CV predictions were compared with diagnoses made by three staff otolaryngologists. RESULTS: The CV model's Dice similarity coefficient for laryngeal anatomy segmentation was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85-0.88). The model differentiated normal from laryngomalacia cases with an accuracy of 0.90 and predicted type 1 and type 2 laryngomalacia with accuracies of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. A type 3 model was not developed due to insufficient cases. CONCLUSION: The CV model successfully segmented laryngeal anatomy, differentiated normal from laryngomalacia cases, and classified type 1 and 2 laryngomalacia from pediatric video nasolaryngoscopy. With dataset expansion, further algorithm refinement, and external validation, this model may serve as a clinical decision support tool in the future.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included patients with stage II–IVA ESCC treated between January 2013 and May 2024. Survival was compared between the radiotherapy without concurrent immunotherapy and radiotherapy with concurrent immunotherapy groups. RESULTS: Of the 91 enrolled patients, 35 received radiotherapy without concurrent immunotherapy and 56 received radiotherapy with concurrent immunotherapy. Median overall survival was worse in the radiotherapy without concurrent immunotherapy group compared to the radiotherapy with concurrent immunotherapy group (18 vs. 41 months; hazard ratio = 0.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.18–0.82; P = 0.013). In contrast, no differences were observed in median disease-free survival, locoregional recurrence-free survival, or distant metastasis-free survival between the two groups. Grade ≥ 3 leukopenia and neutropenia occurred more frequently in the concurrent immunotherapy group. CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort, concurrent immunotherapy was associated with improved overall survival in patients with unresectable locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma who received prior neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. These findings are hypothesis-generating and highlight the need for prospective randomized trials to validate the optimal integration of immunotherapy in this multimodal treatment sequence.</description>

Furthermore, it sought to identify core and bridge symptoms and to observe their changes over time. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted, recruiting 181 survivors newly diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiotherapy. Measurements were taken during weeks 1-6 of radiotherapy. Symptom assessment was conducted using the MD Anderson Symptom Assessment Scale - Head &amp; Neck Module. Symptom network analysis was performed at each time point, and centrality metrics were analyzed to explore the interrelationships among symptoms. RESULTS: Four stable symptom clusters were identified, with fatigue, feeling of being distressed, feeling sad, and difficulty swallowing/chewing as central symptoms, and feeling sad, feeling of being distressed, fatigue, and vomiting as bridge symptoms. The stability of the symptom network across the six time points was acceptable. CONCLUSION: The symptom network results are crucial for developing future targeted symptom management interventions. Future research should focus on developing precise interventions targeting core and bridge symptoms to alleviate nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors' symptom burden. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: For nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors undergoing radiotherapy, implementing a dynamic symptom management strategy with tailored interventions for core and bridge symptoms enhances symptom management efficiency, thereby improving survivors' quality of life.</description>

METHODS: A prospective service evaluation was conducted in a UK hospital receiving ~ 5000 2WW referrals annually. Between November 2023 and March 2025, 2,556 patients underwent telephone triage. Patients scoring ≥ 2.2% on HaNC-RC-v2 remained on the 2WW pathway; those scoring &lt; 2.2% were considered for downgrade to a 6-week review following consultant review of their case. Patients referred with an investigation showing a thyroid nodule suspicious for malignancy were sent straight-to-test for ultrasound-guided biopsy. Diagnostic performance was assessed using histologically confirmed malignancy as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 2,556 triaged patients, 67 (2.6%) had cancer. At the 2.2% cut-off, 16.6% (424/2556) were downgraded, with 3 cancers later diagnosed (0.7%; 3/424). The overall negative predictive value was 99.3% with overall potential harm in 0.12% of all referrals. The straight-to-test pathway diagnosed 14 thyroid cancers (11.6%; 14/121) with shorter mean time to diagnosis (45.3 vs. 56.5 days). CONCLUSION: A nurse-led telephone triage clinic using HaNC-RC-v2 safely downgraded low-risk patients with minimal harm while maintaining a high negative predictive value. Incorporating straight-to-test improved cancer detection and expedited diagnosis. This pathway may enhance service efficiency in managing the increasing volume of suspected cancer referrals across various healthcare systems.</description>

We aim to systematically review and synthesize the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of ENA-SNT. METHODS: This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Articles that reported ENA-SNT cases in humans were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 145 studies were included, comprising 163 patients. The mean age was 28.8 years (range, 0-78), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The nasal septum (33.3%), inferior turbinate (16.6%), and maxillary sinus (16.0%) were the most frequent tumor sites. Common symptoms included nasal obstruction (73.0%) and epistaxis (68.1%), often in combination (55.2%). Angiography demonstrated no hypervascularity in 23.1% of cases; when present, the internal maxillary artery supplied the tumor in 96.1%. Preoperative biopsy caused brisk bleeding in 44.5%. Surgery was the primary treatment in 94.4% of cases, with a recurrence rate of 5.3% and an average time to recurrence of 3.8 months. Intracranial and orbital involvement were rare: 1.84% and 2.45%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This review supports ENA-SNT as a clinical entity distinct from juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Symptoms develop more rapidly, but the tumor is less aggressive, less vascularized, and has a better prognosis. ENA-SNT can occur across all age groups and in female individuals. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, with low recurrence rates.</description>

Additionally, it seeks to develop a multi-indicator-based diagnostic model to provide a scientific basis for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 126 subjects were included and divided into three groups according to the A/N ratio (Group A/N ≤ 0.6, Physiological group 0.61 ≤ A/N ≤ 0.7, Pathological group A/N ≥ 0.71).The study compared the mandibular, two-dimensional airway and three-dimensional airway indicators among the three groups and combined stratified analysis with correlation analysis to identify the risk factors for adenoid hypertrophy. The effectiveness of the diagnostic model was verified using ROC curves, calibration curves and DCA decision curves. RESULTS: 1.There were no significant differences in gender distribution among the three groups (p = 0.404). However, the ANB angle (5.18 ± 2.06 vs.3.73 ± 3.09, p = 0.041) and Z-angle (63 ± 10 vs.57 ± 10, p = 0.014) were significantly higher in the pathological group. This suggests that adenoid hypertrophy may lead to mandibular retrognathia, which in turn may exacerbate Angle Class II malocclusion.2.Three-dimensional airway analysis revealed that the nasopharyngeal volume in the pathological group was 50% less than that in the control group (4,971 ± 1,803 mm3, p &lt; 0.001), confirming its mechanical compressive effect on the upper airway space.3.Age-stratified analysis indicated that in the control group, the U1-SN and U1-NA angles were significantly higher in the ≥ 11 -year- old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting physiological compensation. In the physiological group, the U1-SN angle was significantly higher in the 9-to-11-year-old subgroup than in other age groups (p = 0.036), but no difference was found in airway volume. In the pathological group, the Y-axis angle and MP-FH angle were significantly larger in the ≥ 11-year-old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), implying that early surgical intervention may be necessary for this subgroup.4.A/N was significantly correlated with mandibular, two-dimensional and three-dimensional airway indicators (p &lt; 0.05). Among these, PNS-UPW was identified as an independent risk factor (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74, p &lt; 0.001).5.The multi-indicator diagnostic model demonstrated an AUC of 0.950 (95% CI = 0.904-0.982).The calibration curve (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p &gt; 0.05) and DCA decision curve indicated that the model offered significantly higher net benefits than traditional strategies within the threshold probability range of 0.2-0.8. CONCLUSION: This study, leveraging multimodal data analysis, elucidates the pathological process by which adenoid hypertrophy affects dental and maxillofacial development via dual mechanisms of mechanical compression (airway narrowing) and functional compensation (mandibular retrognathia and abnormal tongue position).The developed diagnostic model serves as a quantification tool for the early identification of high-risk children, provides evidence-based support for determining the optimal timing of ENT surgery and designing orthodontic treatment plans, and is anticipated to enhance the precision and timeliness of children's maxillofacial health management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Whong Z, Malik A, Calder AN, Armstrong MF, Schuman TA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70444'&gt;10.1002/lary.70444&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41699192/'&gt;41699192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 infection on the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: TriNetX, a large international database of anonymized health records, was queried for adults with either positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2024. Patients with cancer or immunodeficiency before the COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable exposure and control groups. Relative risk ratios and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of CRS diagnosis were calculated 3 months after PCR testing. Sub-analyses were completed to investigate the effects of prior COVID-19 infection on subsequent CRS development stratified by prior vaccination status and by variant-dominant time periods (pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron). RESULTS: Propensity score-matched COVID-19+ and COVID-19- cohorts each consisted of 2,135,446 patients. Rate of diagnosis of CRS increased following a positive COVID-19 PCR test (RR = 2.13, 95% CI [2.10-2.16]) and varied across variant-dominant periods, with risk ratios of 1.44 (95% CI [1.41-1.47]) during pre-Delta, 1.20 (95% CI [1.15-1.25]) during Delta, and 2.10 (95% CI [2.07-2.13]) during Omicron. Prior COVID-19 vaccination did not modify the risk of CRS among patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR (RR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.92-1.05]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection was found to increase the risk of subsequent diagnosis of CRS. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between COVID-19 and the development of sinonasal inflammatory pathology.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter development of a CADx model and external validation on independent cohorts. SETTING: Multicenter tertiary referral hospitals (Italy, India, China, Greece, and Spain). METHODS: Over 20,000 images derived from laryngoscopic examinations were retrieved. Images were annotated based on histopathology or expert consensus. A deep learning model was trained using an internal dataset and evaluated on 2 external datasets to assess generalizability. The CADx model classifies only images containing visible lesions, discriminating between LR and HR categories. Diagnostic performance was measured using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model performance was compared with physicians of varying expertise and ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The computer-aided diagnosis model achieved a similar performance across internal and external datasets in distinguishing HR from LR lesions, with accuracy/AUC of 0.90/0.89 internally, 0.85/0.85 on the Greek dataset, and 0.88/0.88 on the Spanish dataset. The model's accuracy was statistically noninferior to that of otolaryngologists and expert laryngologists, and superior to general practitioners and ChatGPT-4o. CONCLUSION: This is a large multicenter clinical validation of a CADx model for laryngeal endoscopy, demonstrating generalizability and performance comparable to clinicians in discriminating between LR and HR lesions. The model's success supports its potential role in augmenting diagnostic capabilities, especially in resource-limited settings. A prospective multicenter clinical trial is underway to assess real-world clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tang A, Helou V, Sridharan SS, Ferrarotto R, Geiger JL, Zandberg DP, Bell D, Skinner H, Spector ME, Myers EN, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70170'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41696986/'&gt;41696986&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To provide a systematic update on the contemporary management of malignancies of the parotid gland (MPG), focusing on evidence-based practices and emerging therapeutics. DATA SOURCES: PubMed literature search. REVIEW METHODS: A search protocol was designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) process for articles published between August 1, 2019, and August 1, 2024. Primary exclusion criteria were non-English text, abstracts, and case reports/series. Secondary inclusion criteria were articles specific to MPG diagnosis, histology, outcomes, and management, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: A total of 1614 articles were identified, and 137 articles were included in the final review. Most studies on low-grade MPG found that surgery alone was noninferior to surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for local control. Elective neck dissection provided survival benefits for high-grade, but not low-grade, MPG. Most MPG are chemotherapy-resistant. Adjuvant chemotherapy provides limited survival benefits while significantly worsening quality of life and, thus, should be used only in select patients. Immunotherapy and targeted therapies for markers, including HER-2, TRK, and androgen receptors, have shown promising results in the treatment of advanced MPG. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Advances in the treatment of MPG have improved survival while minimizing treatment toxicity and improving quality of life. Future studies are needed to emphasize personalized oncologic treatment for patients with these rare malignancies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Weir WH, Cloyd SD, Rickels KL, Farsi S, Davis KP, Hollowoa B, Gardner JR, Sloneker DR, King D, Vural EA, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70185'&gt;10.1002/hed.70185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41693606/'&gt;41693606&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Methods used in assessing decannulation timing after head and neck reconstruction vary widely. In this study, we examined the effect of implementation of a standardized post-operative tracheostomy decannulation protocol on our primary endpoint, return to the emergency room within 30 days for upper airway related issues, as well as on decannulation rates. We also examined the association between several patient/intervention characteristics and successful decannulation prior to discharge. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction requiring tracheostomy between September 2020 and October 2021 at a single tertiary center. A standardized protocol was implemented to determine candidacy for decannulation prior to discharge. Our protocol was two tiered with initial criteria including: tolerance of finger occlusion, passing of abbreviated fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), requiring suction no more frequently than every 4 h, adequate cough, no supplemental oxygen requirements, and alert mental status. Patients meeting these criteria progressed to a 24-h capping trial. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 114 patients who underwent the decannulation protocol, as well as a retrospective control cohort of 96 patients from prior to protocol implementation for a total of 230 patients. Although not significant (p = 0.34), a higher proportion of our protocol cohort, 45/114 (39.5%) of patients decannulated before discharge versus 31/96 (32.3%) of our control patients. For our primary endpoint, only a single patient in the protocol cohort had a return to the ED within 30 days for upper airway related issues compared with 6 patients in the control cohort (0.9% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.048), and we found no significant difference in readmission rates. We also found that across both cohorts, patients with an anterior defect involving the genial tubercle had lower rates of decannulation vs. other patients (24.3% vs. 42.1%; p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a standardized protocol for post-operative head and neck reconstruction patients can give providers greater confidence in discerning which patients are appropriate for decannulation prior to discharge and prevent returns to the emergency room.</description>

METHODS: Seven patients with ADLD underwent DBS (GPi = 4; VIM = 3) surgery. Postoperative voice testing was performed after stable DBS programming. Primary outcome measures included tremor rate, extent of fundamental frequency/intensity modulation, percentage of voicing, duration/number of voice breaks, and cepstral peak prominence. Linear mixed effects models tested voice improvement after GPi and VIM surgery, with significance determined after controlling for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: GPi-DBS showed trends for improved percentage of voicing, duration of voice breaks, number of voice breaks, and extent of intensity modulation pre-post within-group with large effect size. VIM-DBS showed trends for improved tremor rate within-group with large effect size. Between-group comparison showed greater improvement in percentage voicing and extent of intensity modulation in patients with GPi-DBS compared to VIM-DBS, whereas tremor rate showed greater improvement after VIM-DBS compared to GPi-DBS. Duration of voice breaks showed more improvement in GPi than VIM but it did not achieve statistical significance after multiple comparison adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Objective acoustic voice analyses provide preliminary, target-specific patterns that warrant confirmation of bilateral GPi-DBS for patients with ADLD and bilateral VIM-DBS for those with both ADLD and vocal tremor. Future research with larger sample sizes, along with investigations into the neuronal mechanisms underlying laryngeal neuromodulation, is needed to further evaluate the role of DBS in treating ADLD.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jafari M, Hosseini S, Taleei R, Saraei P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.042'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.042&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702442/'&gt;41702442&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced alopecia (RIA) is a common side effect of cranial and head-and-neck radiotherapy that can be temporary or permanent, depending on radiation dose and hair follicles to recover. Since RIA can impact patients' self-image and quality of life, establishing dose thresholds and prevention strategies are essential for patient counseling and treatment planning. METHODS: A PRISMA-guided systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, including studies that reported RIA incidence, severity, persistence or scalp dose metrics in patients receiving external-beam radiotherapy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies (≈1,500 patients) were included, covering a range of techniques including photon-based modalities (3DCRT, IMRT, VMAT), proton therapy, hippocampus-sparing whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and scalp-avoidance approaches. Across modalities, near-maximum scalp dose (D2%) and volumetric parameters consistently correlated with RIA severity. Temporary RIA typically occurred at ∼20 Gy, whereas permanent RIA was observed at mean doses above 30 to 36 Gy or D2% doses approximately 45 to 50 Gy. Proton NTCP and gEUD models showed strong predictive performance (AUC 0.8 to 0.9) and external validity, supporting their use for real-time plan evaluation. Pediatric patients, especially those receiving craniospinal irradiation with intensive chemotherapy, experienced permanent RIA at lower dose thresholds (∼21 Gy). Technical strategies such as scalp-avoidance VMAT and hippocampus-sparing WBRT reduced scalp dose and preserved hair without compromising tumor control. Although patient-reported outcomes were infrequently assessed, available data consistently highlighted significant psychosocial impact and patient interest in restorative interventions. CONCLUSION: RIA is a reproducible, dose-dependent effect with well-defined scalp dose thresholds. Routine scalp contouring, minimizing near-maximum hotspots, and applying scalp-sparing techniques are feasible and clinically impactful strategies. Integration of NTCP modeling and standardized quality-of-life assessments offers personalized risk prediction, supports informed treatment decision-making, and improves survivorship care.</description>

Yet, incidence trends for oral cavity cancers have recently diverged in the United States and several European countries (with declines for most oral cavity cancers but increases for oral tongue cancers), suggesting etiologic differences. This study quantified etiologic heterogeneity across oral cavity cancers using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. METHODS: Cox regression models were used to quantify associations (hazard ratios [HRs] and population attributable fractions [PAFs]) and etiologic heterogeneity for risk factors across oral cavity anatomic sites. RESULTS: Among 490,969 individuals (6,732,760 person-years), 765 incident oral cavity cancers occurred. There was substantial heterogeneity in the associations of smoking and alcohol within constituent oral cavity cancers (HRs for current smokers, &gt;2 drinks/day vs. never-smokers/nondrinkers: floor of mouth = 14.7; hard palate and other mouth = 8.1; oral tongue = 4.9; gum = 2.6; lip = 1.5). PAFs for smoking/alcohol varied widely, ranging from 12.0% for the lip to 56% for the floor of mouth. We observed unexpected associations of increased oral tongue cancer risk with increased consumption of vegetables: total vegetables without legumes (HR per cup equivalent/day, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27); Solanaceae (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.70); Umbelliferae (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.30-4.12); and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78). Associations for total vegetables (HR, 1.12), Solanaceae (HR, 1.26), and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.32) were remarkably similar in the PLCO trial, a prospective US cohort of ∼155,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for disaggregation of oral cavity cancer sites in etiologic studies and reappraisal of widely accepted smoking/alcohol relative risks/attributable fractions.</description>

Cabozantinib, an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity as monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in malignancies. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib and pembrolizumab for patients with aCM. METHODS: This phase 1b/2 study enrolled 28 patients with unresectable aCM. In phase 1b, escalating dose levels of cabozantinib (20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg) were administered concurrently with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks using a 3 + 3 design to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 2, patients received cabozantinib at RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab using a Simon 2 stage design. Primary end point of phase 2 was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Phase 1b enrolled eight patients, cabozantinib 40 mg daily dose level was selected as RP2D. Response rate in stage 1 exceeded predefined criteria for proceeding to expansion phase; however, phase 2 was terminated after 20 patients due to low accrual in the setting of evolving standard of care. Among all treated patients, the most common grade ≥3 toxicities were hypertension (n = 10, 36%), hypokalemia (n = 5, 18%), hypophosphatemia (n = 4, 14%), and ALT elevation (n = 4, 14%). Among 20 patients treated in phase 2, ORR was 45%, median PFS was 6.6 months, and median OS was 29.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib and pembrolizumab combination was explored in treatment-naive aCM. Toxicity was consistent with known profiles, but discontinuation rates were notable.</description>

Primarily, adherence to rest has been measured using patient reports, but their validity is unknown. Instrumental measures of rest adherence are uncommon. Furthermore, to our knowledge, subjectively and instrumentally measured voice rest has not been compared in voice patients. We aimed to compare patient-reported voice use (daily and overall schedules) to concurrent dosimeter readings in postsurgical patients prescribed complete or relative voice rest. METHOD: Sixteen women (M = 45.88 years, SD = 15.39, range: 21-69 years) and seven men (M = 46.43 years, SD = 13.43, range: 31-70 years) who underwent microflap phonosurgery for a primary benign vocal fold lesion were randomized to complete or relative rest, controlling for sex and lesion type. Postoperatively, they wore a VocaLog2 Vocal Activity Monitor for a 7-day voice rest period and used a visual analog scale to record daily and overall subjective adherence. Within-subjects (daily/overall report) and between-subjects (relative/complete rest) factors were compared using analysis of variance; dosimeter data were the outcome variable. RESULTS: For both groups, daily (F1,42 = 4.34, p = 0.04) and overall (F1,42 = 4.38, p = 0.04) subjective ratings significantly differed from dosimeter data. The least-squares-adjusted means indicated that both groups' subjective estimates were 79-83 standardized units lower than the instrumental data across both time points. CONCLUSION: Subjective patient reports of adherence should be carefully considered. The duration of voice use did not differ by the type of voice rest recommended.</description>

Second-line therapies consist of additional immunotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, chemotherapy, salvage surgery, or radiotherapy. Outcomes in this setting remain poorly characterized. We review the first two options for our population. The study objective was to describe non-clinical-trial/off-label immunotherapy treatments for advanced, recurrent, or refractory cSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-institution retrospective case series took place at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a high-volume academic medical oncology practice. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent systemic treatments for advanced cSCC. Patient demographics, clinicopathologic history, cancer data, treatments, and outcomes were abstracted. Overall response and progression-free survival by clinical judgment and overall survival rates were described. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included. Thirteen received cetuximab and 12 ipilimumab after failure of surgery and/or radiation, and of a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal inhibitor (primarily cemiplimab). Four patients are included in both cohorts. Durable complete responses were observed only in patients treated with ipilimumab. Otherwise, all other surviving patients had salvage surgery after some response to second line therapy. CONCLUSION: In this salvage setting, ipilimumab demonstrated a 33% response rate, including complete responses with durable survival. Cetuximab induced response in patients pretreated with cemiplimab whether they had responded or not to this immunotherapy. Most cetuximab-treated patients died within 1-2 years, unless salvaged with surgery.</description>

Data focused on European dental students and their knowledge/attitudes towards the use of AI for diagnosing OC/OPMDs are limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among final-year dental students from six European countries. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers regarding AI in the diagnosis of OC and OPMDs. Data were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics to evaluate differences between countries. RESULTS: A total of 328 students participated (75% female, 25% male). Most students stated that they had not received formal training in AI (61%) and emphasised the need to incorporate such training into the dental curriculum (47%). Students from Portugal had highest overall knowledge scores, but at the same time, lowest overall attitude scores. The most commonly perceived barrier was insufficient training (87.8%). CONCLUSION: Final-year dental students demonstrate positive attitudes towards AI aiding in diagnosis of OC and OPMDs, although significant knowledge and skill gaps remain. Integrating structured AI education into dental curricula is essential to prepare future academics and clinicians for responsible and effective AI use.</description>

METHODS: A total of 107 patients (March 2023-March 2025) were assigned to a control group (n = 51, conventional antifungal therapy) or a study group (n = 57, hypericin + PDT). Post-treatment assessments included oral microbiota structure, α-diversity (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson), community differences (via PCoA and hierarchical clustering), and a mediation model to test C. albicans' role in lesion improvement. RESULTS: Chao1 (species richness) showed no significant difference, but the study group had lower Shannon/Simpson (microbial diversity). Opportunistic pathogens (e.g., C. albicans, Fusobacterium) decreased, while beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) increased. PCoA/clustering confirmed distinct community structures. C. albicans reduction mediated 53.1% of lesion size reduction (indirect effect = -2.656; 95% CI: 0.178-5.755). CONCLUSION: Hypericin + PDT effectively treats oral C. albicans infections safely. C. albicans is the core mediator for lesion area reduction, providing a basis for targeted clinical therapy.</description>

METHODS: An exhaustive literature search across international databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) was performed up to October 2025. Quality evaluation was conducted on the retrieved studies, literature management was performed using EndNote 21.3 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and meta-analyses were executed using RevMan 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK) and Stata 18.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Five studies were included in total, encompassing 465 participants. This meta-analysis of DIF positivity rates in tissues demonstrated significant differences with the following three antibodies between OLP and OLL: fibrin (Fib), IgA, IgM. The area under the curve (AUC) values of Fib and IgA indicated moderate diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analysis of five studies revealed that Fib, IgA, and IgM exhibited significantly higher positive rates in OLP than in OLL, indicating their promising potential for aiding the differential diagnosis of OLP. However, sole reliance on the positivity of a single antibody is insufficient for distinguishing OLP from OLL. Further research on the immunofluorescence patterns of these antibodies will help clarify the diagnostic criteria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This report was preregistered on PROSPERO with the registration ID CRD420251088424; the registration form is provided in Appendix 1.</description>

Even though RT is highly effective in HNSCC, therapeutic efficacy for advanced HNSCC is relatively low; a third of radiotherapy-treated HNSCC patients experiences locoregional relapse within 5 years after treatment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prominent cell types in the tumor micro-environment (TME) in advanced HNSCC and play a key role in therapy resistance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Here, we characterize the response of primary human HNSCC-derived CAFs to radiation and its consequences for CAF function and explore the targetability of radiation-induced senescent CAFs. RESULTS: Using primary human HNSCC-derived CAFs, we show that CAFs survive single-dose RT up to 68 Gy, and fractionated doses of 3×8 Gy; CAFs do not die but go into senescence after radiation. Importantly, we show that the CAF secretome is capable of enhancing both HNSCC cell proliferation and migration, and that CAFs retain these capabilities after radiation. Lastly, we demonstrate that irradiated CAFs display increased sensitivity to Navitoclax (ABT-263), a senolytic drug that selectively induces cell death in senescent cells. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the importance of CAFs in radiotherapy and offers rationale for exploring combinations of radiotherapy and CAF-targeting approaches in HNSCC.</description>

Despite evidence-based recommendations for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat POI, prior studies have shown low HRT use among cervical cancer survivors, particularly those treated with radiation. This study evaluates the impact of practice quality improvement (PQI) initiative within a radiation oncology department on the rates of HRT prescriptions, POI documentation, and counseling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on premenopausal patients aged ≤50 years who received curative-intent radiation for cervical cancer at a single institution from 2018 - 2024. Rates of POI-related counseling and HRT prescriptions were evaluated before and after a PQI intervention targeting POI treatment. HRT prescriptions were stratified by physiologic sex steroid replacement regimens (PSSRR), defined as ≥0.1 mg/day transdermal or ≥2 mg oral 17β-estradiol, vs. other regimens, including oral contraceptives and non-replacement doses of physiologic sex steroid regimens. Binary outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Sixty patients met inclusion criteria. Patients seen after PQI intervention implementation had 2.1 times higher odds of receiving any HRT prescription, PSSRR or non-PSSRR, than patient seen before PQI intervention implementation (OR = 2.09, p = 0.015). PSSRR prescriptions increased from 3.4% pre-intervention to 57.7% post-intervention, with 80.7% of patients seen by an advanced practice provider (APP) receiving PSSRR. POI documentation increased from 48.3% to 80.8%, and inclusion on the problem list increased from 6.9% to 34.6%. High-quality POI counseling improved from 6.9% to 44.2%, and high-quality HRT counseling improved from 0.0% to 46.2%. CONCLUSION: The radiation oncology department-based PQI initiative significantly improved documentation, counseling, and PSSRR prescriptions for cervical cancer survivors.</description>

NMSC predominantly affects the head and neck, with over 80% of cases arising in this region. This study aimed to investigate the differences in anatomical distribution, epidemiological and histological characteristics of NMSC in a Caucasian population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 556 primary head and neck NMSC treated at a referral centre between January 2016 and December 2021. Relative tumour density (RTD), BCC/SCC ratio, and Chi-square test were used for skin tumour analysis. RESULTS: The RTD was highest on the nose (RTD 11.24, 95% CI 9.6-12.8) for basal cell carcinoma (BCC), on the ear and periauricular area (RTD 4.79, 95% CI 3.56-6.02) for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and on the cheek/cheekbone area (RTD 10, 95% CI 5.52-15.51) for SCC in situ. The total ratio BCC/SCC ratio was 2.69/1 (95% CI 2.5-2.87). The highest BCC/SCC ratio was found on the nose (6.35/1, 95% CI 5.81-6.88), while the lowest ratio on the scalp (0.4/1, 95% CI 0-3.81). Chi-square analysis revealed significant associations (p &lt; 0.05) between histologic type with primary anatomic site, age distribution, sex, and depth of invasion (DOI). At the time of diagnosis, SCC tumours were significantly larger than BCC, with mean diameters of 13.45 mm and 9.38 mm, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed statistically significant differences in clinical presentation between BCC, SCC and SCC in situ in the head and neck region. These findings may guide clinical suspicion and therapeutic decisions during patient evaluation.</description>

PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to estimate the frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications and identify associated risk factors in external and internal maxillary sinus lift procedures. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Periodontology, Gulhane Faculty of Dentistry, University of Health Sciences. Adult patients requiring maxillary sinus floor elevation via internal or external approaches were included based on residual bone height and radiographic availability. Exclusion criteria comprised systemic conditions affecting bone healing, heavy smoking, a history of sinus surgery or radiotherapy, and incomplete clinical records. PREDICTOR/EXPOSURE/INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: The primary predictor variable was the sinus lift technique (internal vs external). Additional predictors included patient-related, sinus- and site-related, and procedure-related factors. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was the occurrence of surgery-related intraoperative or postoperative complications (yes/no). Secondary outcomes included the types and frequencies of complications according to surgical technique. COVARIATES: Not applicable. ANALYSES: Statistical analyses included χ2 tests, independent samples t tests, and binary logistic regression analyses to identify independent factors, with P &lt; .05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 144 subjects (mean age, 49.0 ± 10.9 years), of whom 56.9% (n = 82) were women. Internal sinus lift was performed in 60.4% (n = 87) and external sinus lift in 39.6% (n = 57), with no significant age difference between groups (P = .2). Most subjects were systemically healthy 70.1% (n = 101), not using regular medication 72.2% (n = 104), and nonsmokers 91.0% (n = 131). Implant placement was achieved in 61.4% (n = 35). Sinus septa were present in 11.8% (n = 17), sinus pathology in 14.6% (n = 21), and bruxism in 22.9% (n = 33). Internal sinus lift was associated with a significantly lower overall complication rate than the external approach (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within the limitations of this retrospective study, internal sinus lift procedures were associated with fewer complications than external approaches, highlighting the importance of careful preoperative evaluation and appropriate technique selection.</description>

While traditional risk factors such as tobacco use and viral infections are well-established, the dysbiosis of oral and gut microbiota has recently emerged as a pivotal contributor to HNC pathogenesis. The oral-gut axis serves as a critical conduit for bidirectional microbial crosstalk, facilitated by bacterial translocation, metabolic exchange, and immune modulation, collectively fostering a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Key oral pathogens, including Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, exacerbate chronic inflammation, promote immune evasion, and activate oncogenic signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, MAPK/ERK, and PD-1/PD-L1. In parallel, gut dysbiosis influences HNC progression by altering the production of microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, and tryptophan derivatives, which systemically regulate inflammation and anti-tumor immunity. Growing evidence also implicates the microbiota in modulating responses to radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Therapeutic strategies targeting the oral-gut axis, including probiotics and antimicrobial peptides, hold promise for alleviating treatment-induced mucosal injury and improving therapeutic outcomes. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist, including elucidating network-level microbial interactions, validating robust biomarkers, and advancing these findings into clinical practice. Future multidisciplinary collaborations are essential to fully leverage the oral-gut microbiota axis for precision oncology in HNC.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the oncologic safety of a radiotherapy-de-escalation strategy and to identify predictive biomarkers for its success. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, pCR patients were categorized into a de-escalation group (n=65) and a standard care group (adjuvant radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy, n=286). Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare disease-free survival (DFS). Comprehensive genomic and immune profiling was conducted on pre-treatment biopsies from the de-escalation cohort to identify biomarkers associated with recurrence. RESULTS: After 1:1 PSM, DFS was equivalent between the de-escalation and standard care groups (HR 1.25, 95% CI 0.72-2.18; p=0.425). The de-escalation strategy yielded significantly better quality of life and eliminated severe radiation toxicities, albeit with increased immune-related adverse events. Within the de-escalation cohort, multivariate analysis identified TP53 mutation (adjusted HR 4.05, p=0.019) and a low pre-treatment B cell signature score (adjusted HR 2.15 per 1-unit decrease, p=0.010) as independent predictors of worse DFS. A two-biomarker model stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with distinct recurrence rates (0%, 17.1%, and 40.0%, respectively; p=0.019). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant radiotherapy omission with maintenance immunotherapy appears to be a safe and patient-beneficial strategy for OSCC patients achieving pCR after NICT. The integrated TP53/B-cell biomarker model provides preliminary evidence for personalizing this de-escalation approach.</description>

We aimed to investigate HR-HPV prevalence in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and cervical dysplasia (CD), association with disease severity, and prevalence changes over time. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Cervical tissue samples from 145 patients were retrieved and used for HR-HPV genotyping using two commercially available PCR kits. RESULTS: Only six CD samples were HR-HPV negative (6/66, 9.1%), while all CSCC were positive. Over 50% samples (75/139) harbored one, 33.8% two, 10.1% three, and 2.2% four HR-HPV genotypes. CSCC was more likely to harbor multiple HR-HPVs (p=0.0280). HPV16 remained most prevalent in CSCC and CD and was followed by HPV33 (32/139, 23.0%), HPV39 (13/139, 9.4%), and HPV18 (11/139, 7.9%). CSCC samples were more likely to have high HR-HPV loads (p=0.025). Disease severity expressed as CINI to CSCC grade 3, correlated with HR-HPVs detected (p=0.015, r=0.202) and HPV16 and HPV39 loads (p&lt;0.001, r=0.354; p&lt;0.001, r=0.307). prevalence decreased, insignificantly across the analyzed period, while HPV18 decreased significantly (2016-18: 17.4% vs. 2022-24: 2.2%; p=0.032). HPV66, 45, 39, 31, and 33 (2016-18: 13%; 2022-24:31.1%; p=0.045) increased. DISCUSSION: HPV16 remained the most prevalent HR-HPV, while HPV18 decreased. Other HR-HPV genotypes (HPV 66/45/39/31/33) demonstrated an increase in prevalence. Cervical disease severity was linked to specific HR-HPV loads and the number infecting HR-HPVs. These findings highlight the need for extended HR-HPV genotyping with determination of viral load, and request more epidemiological studies analyzing historical and current samples.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Panesar KS, Smith C, Zhang Z, Dodson TB, Burke A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.020'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.020&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41713495/'&gt;41713495&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cannabis users (CUs) may have higher intravenous general anesthetic (IVGA) requirements. It is unclear how cannabis exposure correlates with anesthetic requirements. PURPOSE: The primary purpose was to measure the association between cannabis exposure and total milligrams of propofol (TMP). The secondary purpose was to use cannabis exposure years (CEYs) and TMP for exposure risk stratification. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: The investigators conducted a prospective study with a sample of subjects &gt; 21 scheduled for third molar (M3) removal requiring at least one upper and lower M3 under IVGA between May 1, 2022, and February 28, 2023, at the University of Washington Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) clinic. Exclusion criteria were subjects &lt; 21, pregnant, previous substance use history, or who didn't qualify for IVGA. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was CEY, a continuous variable calculated by multiplying questionnaire responses for frequency (exposures per days, weeks, months, and years) and duration (weeks, months, and years). OUTCOME VARIABLE: The primary outcome variable was TMP (mg). Secondary outcome variables include stratifying cannabis exposure risk with TMP. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, American Society Anesthesiology (ASA) classification, tobacco use, weight, body mass index (BMI), Mallampati score, number of M3s removed, and anesthesia and procedure times. ANALYSES: Independent t test, Fisher exact test, Pearson correlation coefficients, multivariate linear regression, and regression decision tree analysis were used. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 49 subjects with a mean age of 26.7 ± 5.5 years, 30 (61.2%) females, 38 (77.6%) CUs, and mean CEY 55.6 ± 50.2. Bivariate analysis showed a nonsignificant correlation between CEY and TMP (r = 0.3, P = .07). After adjusting confounders, CEY was significantly associated with TMP (coefficient = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.25, P = .03). Regression decision tree analysis stratified cannabis exposure based on TMP into 3 groups: 1) high risk (≥2 to 3 years, multiple daily use), 2) moderate risk (&gt;2 to 3 years, infrequent use), and 3) low risk (&lt;2 to 3 years, infrequent use). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Subjects reporting cannabis exposure ≥ 2 to 3 years of use with multiple daily sessions can be considered high risk for increased TMP for M3 removal.</description>

This study explores the potential of photochemical tissue bonding (PTB), a light-activated technique that forms molecular crosslinks between collagen molecules, to seal a commercial nerve connector in place for IAN and LN nerve repair. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the repair strength of conventional suture and PTB repair in a nerve transection model. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This was an ex vivo study conducted on IAN and LN harvested from independently euthanized Yorkshire pigs. The nerves were transected and then repaired by a single operator at Massachusetts General Hospital. Both repair techniques were performed on nerves retrieved from the same donor animal to minimize variability. Intraoral PTB repair of both IAN and LN was also simulated in a euthanized swine model. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the nerve repair technique. Transected IAN and LN nerves were repaired using 4 simple interrupted 10-0 polyamide monofilament sutures or photochemical crosslinked porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) (Axoguard Nerve Connector). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was mechanical repair strength, measured as maximal load to failure and maximum stress at failure, using an ADMET mechanical microtester. COVARIATES: Nerve cross-sectional area was included as a covariate. ANALYSES: Paired t tests were used to compare maximal load to failure and maximum stress at failure between the 2 repair methods. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: A total of 14 nerves were repaired. The maximal load to failure was 2.76 ± 1.01 N and 0.39 ± 0.28 N for the PTB with porcine SIS conduits and suture repair groups, respectively (P = .0006). The maximum stress at failure was 0.490 ± 0.319 N/mm2 and 0.125 ± 0.181 N/mm2 for the PTB with porcine SIS conduits and suture repair groups, respectively (P = .0039). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that photosealed porcine SIS across the transected nerve provides greater mechanical strength than that of suture repair alone. Given the known benefits of PTB, this technique has high potential to enhance and streamline nerve repair in oral and maxillofacial surgery.</description>

Systemic treatment for this condition is not well defined. This study aimed to describe real-world clinical practice patterns of systemic therapy and its outcomes in patients with advanced chordoma treated at a sarcoma referral center member of the European Reference Network on Rare Adult Solid Cancers (EURACAN). METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with histologically confirmed chordoma, diagnosed between 2005 and 2024, who received tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic, clinicopathological, and treatment data were collected from institutional databases. Responses were radiologically assessed according to RECIST criteria by sarcoma radiologists as part of routine clinical care. Data were collected up to December 31, 2024. RESULTS: A total of 13 patients (median age 62 years) were identified. All had undergone surgery, and more than half received adjuvant radiation therapy. Most patients (n=10, 76.9%) received systemic therapy with imatinib as first-line treatment, while a minority (n=2, 15.4%) received ICIs as first-line therapy. Several patients received multiple lines of treatment, including sequential exposure to TKI and ICI. Objective responses were observed in 2 of 5 patients in the TKI-only subgroup (40.0%) and 4 of 8 patients in the ICI-exposed subgroup (50.0%), all of which were partial responses, with prolonged disease stabilization being the a common outcome. The median progression-free survival (PFS) for the entire cohort was 12.3 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 149.8 months. The median PFS and median OS in the TKI-only subgroup were 7.4 and 113.5 months, respectively, whereas they were 12.7 and 151.6 months in the ICI-exposed subgroup, respectively. Subgroup results are descriptive, exploratory, and hypothesis-generating due to the small sample size. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that systemic therapy can provide durable disease control in selected patients with chordoma. TKI are commonly used and may provide good responses while ICIs show potential activity in selected patients but await confirmation in robust clinical trials. These real-world data reinforce the need for prospective, multicenter studies to optimize treatment sequencing and patient selection in this rare malignancy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yu S, Hong JT, Jung HK, Lee HA, Jeong ES, Lee H, Don Choi K, Jung HY, Park JC, Kwon JG, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.60193'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.60193&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41719041/'&gt;41719041&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is highly prevalent in Asian populations and carries a poor prognosis. With growing numbers of cancer survivors, the prognostic impact of prior cancer in ESCC remains unclear. Most existing data are derived from Western cohorts dominated by adenocarcinoma, limiting generalizability to Asian populations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether prior cancer is associated with overall survival (OS) and esophageal cancer-specific mortality (ECSM) in a nationwide Korean ESCC cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed ESCC across 19 tertiary hospitals in Korea from 2005 to 2017 was conducted. Follow-up was completed in 2017. Data were reanalyzed in August 2025. Exclusion criteria were nonsquamous histology (including adenocarcinoma), diagnosis of esophageal cancer within 6 months of a prior cancer, multiple prior cancers, and hematologic cancers. EXPOSURES: History of cancer before the diagnosis of ESCC, classified by cancer type and latency (≤5 years vs &gt;5 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was OS, and the secondary outcome was esophageal cancer-specific mortality (ECSM). Hazard ratios (HRs) and cause-specific hazard ratios (CSHRs) were estimated after adjustment for clinicopathologic and treatment variables. Propensity score-adjusted Cox regression and competing risk regression models were used. Subgroup analyses were conducted by prior cancer type and latency period. RESULTS: Of the 5557 patients (mean [SD] age, 64.7 [8.9] years; 5168 [93.0%] male), 368 (6.6%) had a prior cancer and were older and more often diagnosed at an earlier stage than those without prior cancer. Patients with a prior cancer had significantly poorer outcomes, with a median OS of 3.58 (95% CI, 2.50-4.92) vs 4.25 (95% CI, 3.83-4.58) years and a 3-year ECSM of 8.35% (95% CI, 4.42%-12.29%) vs 4.98% (95% CI, 4.17%-5.78%) compared with those without a prior cancer. Prior cancer was independently associated with worse OS (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.47) and ECSM (CSHR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.09-3.29). Among prior cancer types, patients with a history of stomach, head and neck, or lung cancer demonstrated poorer OS (HR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.24-2.15; P &lt; .001). A latency of 5 or more years was also associated with reduced OS (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.03-1.57; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this nationwide Korean cohort study, prior cancer was an independent adverse prognostic factor in ESCC, with stomach, head and neck, and lung cancers associated with the poorest outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; van de Schoor CCE, Bittermann GKP, Hagens ERC, Vaassen LAA, Kessler PAWH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.018'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41713494/'&gt;41713494&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Among patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), achieving adequate histopathological resection margins is critical to reduce recurrence risk. Although a ≥5 mm margin is the accepted standard, recent discussions suggest that smaller margins, such as ≥3 mm, may offer comparable oncologic outcomes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of histopathological margin width in patients with OSCC and to potentially minimize the risk of overtreatment. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery, Maastricht University Medical Center. Patients ≥18 years who underwent primary surgical resection for OSCC between January 2014 and December 2018 were included. The exclusion criteria were recurrent disease, incomplete pathology reports, or nonconfirmed malignancy. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was histologic resection margin, and subjects were grouped into 3 groups based on histopathological resection margin: group 1: &lt;3 mm, group 2: 3-4.99 mm, and group 3: ≥5 mm. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: The outcome variable was therapeutic effect measured using recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). COVARIATES: Collected covariates included age, sex, smoking status, tumor site and stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, extranodal extension, growth pattern, presence of adjacent tooth, intraoperative reresection, radiotherapy, and additional surgery. ANALYSES: Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed, and Kaplan-Meier curves visualized RFS and OS. A P value &lt;.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 157 subjects with a mean age of 67 (±11.2) and 75 (47.8%) were male. Margins ≥5 mm were achieved in 70 (44.6%) subjects. No significant difference in RFS was observed between 3 to 4.99 mm and ≥5 mm (hazard ratio = 2.071; CI, 0.736 to 5.828; P = .2). OS did not significantly differ between groups hazard ratio = 1.346, 95% CI 0.667 to 2.717, P = .4). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Margins ≥3 mm may offer comparable oncologic outcomes to ≥5 mm, potentially reducing overtreatment in selected OSCC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Podemska E, Gostomczyk K, Jerka D, Borowczak J, Gagat M, Grzanka D, Durślewicz J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2026.1663235'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2026.1663235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41704611/'&gt;41704611&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Despite advances in therapy, survival remains poor due to late diagnosis and treatment resistance. Identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers is essential to improve risk stratification and clinical outcomes. METHODS: MRPL23 expression was evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker in NSCLC using immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from 110 patients and mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Associations between MRPL23 expression and clinicopathological features, as well as overall survival, were analyzed using survival statistics. RESULTS: MRPL23 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues (p &lt; 0.0001), with particularly elevated levels observed in squamous cell carcinoma. High MRPL23 protein expression was detected in 57 of 110 cases (51.8%) and was associated with shorter overall survival (median OS 34 vs. 48 months; HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.58, p = 0.04). These findings were validated in the TCGA cohort, where high MRPL23 mRNA expression correlated with worse overall survival (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.83, p &lt; 0.01). DISCUSSION: MRPL23 overexpression, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. These results suggest that MRPL23 represents a promising biomarker for improving risk stratification and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies in patients with NSCLC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rees-Punia E, Teras LR, Newton CC, Moore SC, Lee IM, Bates-Fraser L, Chiang KE, Bloodworth DE, Eliassen AH, Mucci L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56971'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56971&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701497/'&gt;41701497&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether physical activity lengthens survival among people with a history of cancers less commonly studied for such benefit. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between physical activity assessed after a cancer diagnosis with cancer mortality and, secondarily, changes in physical activity before vs after diagnosis with cancer mortality among people previously diagnosed with 1 of 7 cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a pooled dataset of 6 cohorts (Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Women's Health Study). Participants were survivors of bladder, endometrial, kidney, lung, oral cavity, ovarian, or rectal cancer who had completed surveys and had repeated measures of leisure-time physical activity. Baseline data were collected from 1976 through 1997. The mean (SD) follow-up was 10.9 (7.0) years. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to March 2024. EXPOSURES: Leisure-time moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) before and after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of MVPA in categories of metabolic equivalents of task hours per week (MET-h/wk) measured before and a mean (SD) of 2.8 (1.5) years after cancer diagnosis with cancer mortality. RESULTS: This pooled analysis included 17 141 cancer survivors (mean [SD] age, 67 [8] years; 60% female). Engagement in low amounts of MVPA (&gt;0 to &lt;7.5 vs 0 MET-h/wk) was associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among survivors who had been diagnosed with bladder (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.50-0.91]), endometrial (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45-0.87]), and lung cancer (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.43-0.75]). Doubling the recommended MVPA guideline or more (eg, &gt;15 vs 0 MET-h/wk) was associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among oral (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.15-0.99] for &gt;22.5 to 30.0 MET-h/wk) and rectal (HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.97] for &gt;15.0 to 22.5 MET-h/wk) cancer survivors. Point estimates were less than 1 for cancer mortality among kidney cancer survivors (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.22-1.18] for &gt;15.0 to 22.5 MET-h/wk), although the confidence interval included the null. Compared with survivors who did not meet the MVPA guidelines before or after diagnosis, lung (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]) and rectal (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.83]) cancer survivors who met guidelines after diagnosis had a lower risk of cancer mortality, even if they were inactive before their diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of 6 pooled cohorts, higher levels of MVPA after a cancer diagnosis were associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among people previously diagnosed with 1 of 7 cancers not commonly studied for their association with MVPA. Findings suggest that it is important for health care professionals to promote physical activity for longevity and overall health among people living with and beyond cancer.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To analyze new skin cancers in participants with high-risk stage II melanoma treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The multicenter double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 randomized clinical trial enrolled 976 participants 12 years or older with completely resected stage IIB or IIC cutaneous melanoma between September 23, 2018, and November 4, 2020. Follow-up was completed on February 16, 2024. This analysis was not prespecified in the trial protocol. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab, 200 mg (2 mg/kg for pediatric participants), or placebo, every 3 weeks for no more than 17 cycles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Secondary analyses of incidence and time to diagnosis of new melanoma or other cutaneous malignant neoplasm, sensitivity analysis of recurrence-free survival (RFS) with new primary melanoma counted as an event, and incidence of immune-mediated severe skin reactions. RESULTS: A total of 976 participants were assigned to treatment (487 to pembrolizumab and 489 to placebo), of whom 589 (60.3%) were male (median age at diagnosis, 61 [IQR, 52-69] years). The median follow-up was 52.8 (range, 39.4-64.8) months. In the pembrolizumab group, 37 participants (7.6%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 168.0 [range, 1.0-1182.0] days); 12 (2.5%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 6 (1.2%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 19 (3.9%) had basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and 9 (1.8%) had cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). In the placebo group, 56 participants (11.5%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 177.0 [range, 1.0-1043.0] days); 9 (1.8%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 9 (1.8%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 26 (5.3%) had BCC, and 17 (3.5%) had cSCC. Median RFS with new primary melanoma counted as an event was not reached with pembrolizumab and was 59.2 months (95% CI, 53.9 months to not reached) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.80); 48-month RFS was 68.7% and 56.5%, respectively. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred in 16 of 483 participants (3.3%) in the pembrolizumab group and 3 of 486 (0.6%) in the placebo group (grade 3 or 4: 14 [2.9%] vs 3 [0.6%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the incidence of new primary melanoma was not different between groups, whereas nonmelanoma skin cancers were more common with placebo. The RFS benefit of pembrolizumab remained after accounting for new primary melanomas. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred infrequently and were manageable. These findings support the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in high-risk stage II melanoma. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03553836.</description>

Effective treatments addressing these determinants are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether enhanced group prenatal care (eGPC) outperforms enhanced individual prenatal care (eIPC) for reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conduced in 10 Medicaid-serving clinics in California's San Joaquin Valley, enrolling English- or Spanish-speaking Medicaid-eligible pregnant individuals at less than 25 weeks' gestation, from November 2019 to January 2024, with 2 follow-up surveys through 12 weeks postpartum. Analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to December 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to eIPC or eGPC. eIPC enhancements included assessments tailored to individual psychosocial, clinical, oral health, and substance use needs. eGPC enhancements included childcare, perinatal mental health screening and referral, transportation stipends, free groceries, and information on community resources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was depression, operationalized as change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores from baseline to 3 months postpartum. Outcomes were assessed by masked assessors. RESULTS: Of 1663 individuals assessed, 678 were enrolled and randomized; 4 withdrew consent, yielding an analyzed sample of 674 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.0 [5.8] years), including 50 African American or Black participants (7.4%); 37 biracial, multiracial, or multiethnic participants (5.5%); 485 Latine participants (72.0%); 77 White participants (11.4%); and 24 participants who identified as another race or ethnicity (3.6%). After randomization, there were 294 participants in the eGPC group and 380 participants in the eIPC group. No difference in reductions in depressive symptom severity from baseline to 3 months postpartum by randomization group was observed (Cohen d for between-group change, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3; P = .45), adjusting for baseline depressive symptom severity, self-reported history of a mental health condition, language, and calendar time at enrollment. Instead, participants in both groups experienced small to moderate reductions in depression symptoms from baseline to 3 months postpartum (eGPC: mean [SD] difference, -2.2 [5.3]; Cohen d = -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.3; P &lt; .001; eIPC: mean [SD] difference, -1.6 [4.5]; Cohen d = -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of pregnant, low-income, primarily Latine individuals, statistically significant improvements were observed in depressive symptom severity from baseline to postpartum, regardless of prenatal care type. There was no evidence of a difference between enhanced prenatal care types for improving depressive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04154423.</description>

Associated TGM1, PPL, and KRT proteins are involved in epithelial cell structure, adhesion, and differentiation. OBJECTIVE PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 levels in tumors and matched surgical margin samples from 52 HNSCC patients and assess correlations with clinical and demographic variables using ELISA. RESULTS: No significant differences in TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 levels were found between tumor and margin samples. However, in tumor tissue, TGM1 and KRT8 levels showed a statistically significant association with T status. In margins, PPL and KRT8 levels were also associated with T status. Additionally, PPL and TGM1 levels were correlated with N status in both tumor and margin samples, respectively. A significantly higher level of PPL was observed in OSCC tumors compared to HPSCC+LSCC. TGM1 levels in tumor and margin samples were correlated in patients with concomitant diseases. Analysis of HPV and p16 status revealed differences in PPL and KRT8 levels between tumor and margin samples. Furthermore, differences in PPL, TGM1, and KRT8 levels were observed in relation to smoking and alcohol use, distinguishing regular or occasional users from abstinent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that impaired TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 signaling pathways might play a role in HNSCC, indicating their potential relevance for future diagnostic and therapeutic investigations. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, clarify the mechanistic role of these proteins in disease progression, and assess their clinical utility.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study analyzed 120 cases from 2017 to 2022, including OPMD with varying degrees of epithelial dysplasia and OSCC. Immunohistochemical staining for OPN was performed, and clinicopathologic variables such as patient demographics, lesion site and size, clinical presentation, and histopathologic features were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess associations between OPN expression and clinicopathologic parameters. RESULTS: Patients ranged from 22-92 years (mean: 59.3), with a slight female predominance (54.2%). The lateral tongue was the most affected site, and leukoplakia was the predominant clinical presentation. Mean lesion size was 15.8 mm, with mean duration of 23.2 months. OPN expression was detected in 68.2% of cases, with high intensity staining in 46.7%. While stronger OPN expression was noted at OSCC invasion fronts, no significant association was found between OPN levels and epithelial dysplasia grade. CONCLUSIONS: OPN does not appear to correlate with epithelial dysplasia or malignant transformation in OPMD. However, its overexpression at OSCC invasion fronts compared to adjacent areas suggests a role in early invasion, potentially helping identify initial lesions with more aggressive behavior.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective collection of clinical data for 36 patients with gynecological malignancies who underwent radiotherapy at our hospital from January 2004 to December 2021. RESULTS: The first primary cancer was predominantly cervical cancer (31 cases, 86.1%), with endometrial cancer accounting for 5 cases. Radiotherapy-related variables included the median radiotherapy duration of 42.5 days, external irradiation dose of 49.375 Gy, and total dose of 69.5 Gy; FIGO stages I/II/III were 7/18/11; lymph node metastasis in 6 cases; HPV positive in 20 cases; surgical history in 18 cases and chemotherapy history in 30 cases. The SPC cohort had a median onset age of 58 years and a median interval of 8 years after radiotherapy, with primary sites mostly in the rectum/colon and uterus; 24 cases occurred outside the radiotherapy field. Surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy histories all influenced the timing and site of SPC. The median onset age after radiotherapy and interval to SPC were significantly longer in the cervical cancer group than in the endometrial cancer group (P = 0.01), and most SPC occurred within 5-10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological features and treatment history of the initial cancer were associated with the timing and location of SPC. Analyses of post-radiotherapy SPC characteristics provide a scientific basis for optimizing clinical management and reducing SPC risk.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; van Dijk LV, Ventura J, Wahid KA, Zhu LL, McDonald BA, Ahmed S, Sanders KL, Stieb SM, McCoy L, Sharafi CS, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.12.013'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.12.013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702795/'&gt;41702795&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: Determine the utility of low-flip angle "black bone" magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for cortical mandibular bone assessment compared to computed tomography (CT). METHODS: Quantification of cortical mandibular bone width was performed per Hamada et al. at 15 cross-sectional interdentium locations on pretreatment black bone MRI and CT for 15 oropharyngeal cancer patients, with interobserver analyses on a subset of three patients by 11 observers. CT and MRI measurements were compared using Bland-Altman analysis, Lin's concordance, and Deming regression; interobserver variability was assessed with absolute variance and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). RESULTS: Bland Altman and Deming regression analyses showed CT and black bone MRI measurements were comparable within ±0.85mm limits of agreement, and systematically smaller for MRI. ICC (0.60[0.52;0.67]) showed moderate equivalence between modalities. The average absolute variance between the observers was similar on CT (1.13±0.06mm) and MRI (1.15±0.06mm). ICC analysis showed that measurement consistency was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) for black bone MRI (0.43[0.32;0.56]) than CT (0.22[0.13;0.35]); nonetheless, ICC was poor for both modalities. CONCLUSION: Black bone MRI is a viable alternative to CT for assessing mandibular cortical bone and early detection of anatomical changes like osteoradionecrosis. Both modalities showed similar interobserver variability, which may be reduced through (semi)automated measurement.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; You J, Ou H, Zhang Y, Wu X, Zhang L, Jin Z, Chen Q, Shen H, Liu X, Sun J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111223'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111223&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41429722/'&gt;41429722&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning can non-invasively depict the radiological phenotype of tumor. We aimed to propose an end-to-end deep learning framework called NPC-SurvAI to perform prognosis assessment using MRI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 2180 NPC patients who underwent baseline MRI. The NPC-SurvAI comprised an AttVNet for image segmentation and a DenseNet-ICAM for prognosis evaluation, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The clinical model was built with age, T-stage, N-stage, and EBV DNA. The image and combined models were developed by the NPC-SurvAI framework. The integrated area under the curve (iAUC) and thetime-dependent AUC (tAUC) were leveraged to measure the predictive accuracy. K-means clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to stratify patients into subtypes and compare their prognoses. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, the AttVNet achieved average Dice similarity coefficients of 0.726-0.764 tumor segmentation. The dynamic change curves of the AUCs over time suggested that the combined model outperformed both the clinical and image models in predicting PFS (iAUC: 0.838-0.884 vs 0.788-0.844 vs 0.738-0.798) and OS (iAUC: 0.842-0.894 vs 0.793-0.853 vs 0.754-0.807) at any time point from 1 to 8 years. Specially, the combined model achieved time-AUCs of 0.844-0.930 for 3-year PFS and 0.827-0.896 for 5-year PFS; 0.838-0.978 for 3-year OS and 0.788-0.871 for 5-year OS. Additionally, patients could be stratified into two subtypes with different survivals (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NPC-SurvAI has the potential to automatically stratify patients with diverse prognoses, which helps clinicians in optimizing treatment decisions and surveillance.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Soopramanien J, Mittal S, Jadeja K, Soni L, Saghir S, Mannan F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41442908/'&gt;41442908&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambient air pollution is a major global health concern, yet its association with laryngeal cancer remains poorly defined. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants and incidence of laryngeal cancer. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were conducted from inception to 01/06/2024. Eligible studies included observational and ecological designs reporting quantitative associations between ambient pollutants and laryngeal cancer incidence. Study quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty graded were appraised using the NIH tool, National Toxicology Program framework and GRADE approach respectively. A total of nine studies (4 ecological, 5 cohort) comprising over 7.4 million participants were included. Each pollutant was analysed by a maximum of 3 studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) demonstrated the most consistent association with laryngeal cancer, with hazard ratios between 1.18 and 1.24 per 10 μg/m³ increase. One large cohort reported a significant relationship between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and laryngeal cancer (HR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.2-2.85), while findings across other pollutants, including PM₁₀, SO₂, O₃, CO, and NOₓ, were inconsistent. Although data remain limited, emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to ambient NO₂ and PM₂.₅ may increase laryngeal cancer risk. Future large-scale prospective cohort studies with standardized exposure metrics and robust confounding control are needed to better characterise this relationship. Natural experiments in regions undergoing major air-quality policy changes can provide valuable evidence on the impact of reducing exposure on laryngeal cancer incidence at a population level.</description>

The study aimed to identify the roles of FOXO1, hsa-miR-96-5p, and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 in the molecular pathogenesis of LSCC patients based on the systems biology data. METHODS: The LSCC patient tissue samples (n = 50) and the same individual's adjacent normal tissues (n = 50) were collected from the candidates (aged 57.75 ± 9.3 years) of surgery. The miR-96-5p and lncRNA ADAMTS9-AS2 were predicted using the specific servers. The Kaplan Meier analysis was employed using TCGA data. The FOXO1and ncRNA gene expression levels were measured with the RT-qPCR technique. The Western blot technique was applied to estimate FOXO1/pFOXO1 protein values. RESULTS: A FOXO1/miR-96-5p/ADAMTS9-AS2 gene network was constructed and enriched using the bioinformatics data. The FOXO1 (p 0.037) correlated with ADAMTS9-AS2 (p 0.04) gene expression levels and was reduced in the LSCC patient tissue samples despite the elevated miR-96-5p expression levels (p 0.047). Moreover, the FOXO1 (p &lt; 0.01) and pFOXO1 (p &lt; 0.0001) protein values were reduced in the LSCC. The high FOXO1 and ADAMTS9-AS2 gene expression levels significantly increased the survival probability (HR 0.61 and 0.65, respectively). CONCLUSION: The FOXO1 and ADAMTS9-AS2 genes might act as molecular suppressors in the cell growth pathways. Furthermore, miR-96-5p is suggested as an oncogenic miRNA in the LSCC.</description>

We applied an automated artificial intelligence (AI) imaging platform integrating lymph node autosegmentation with ENE prediction to determine the prognostic value of the number of predicted ENE nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multisite, retrospective study of 1,733 OPC patients with pretreatment computed tomography who underwent definitive radiation therapy across three institutions. Malignant lymph nodes were segmented using a validated deep learning auto-segmentation model, and segmented lymph nodes were sequentially processed with a validated ENE prediction model to calculate number of nodes with AI-predicted ENE (AI-ENE) per patient. We evaluated associations of AI-ENE with disease outcomes using site-stratified, multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for human papillomavirus (HPV) status, smoking pack-years, tumor and nodal stage, age, and sex. We evaluated risk-stratification improvement when incorporating AI-ENE into the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 risk groupings and derived American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging with Uno C-indices and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: Overall, median AI-ENE node number was 1 (range, 0-6). AI-ENE node number was independently associated with poorer distant control (DC; hazard ratio [HR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.69]; P &lt; .001) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.46]; P &lt; .001). Increasing AI-ENE node number was incrementally associated with worse outcome, particularly DC (P &lt; .001). C-indices improved in the external data set when incorporating AI-ENE into RTOG-0129 groupings (OS: 0.70 v 0.65; DC: 0.65 v 0.57) and AJCC-8 stage (OS: 0.75 v 0.70; DC: 0.72 v 0.67; P &lt; .001 for each). The largest improvements were observed among HPV-negative patients (C-index: +15% for OS, +14% for DC). CONCLUSION: Automated, AI-ENE node number is a novel risk factor for OPC that may better inform pretreatment risk stratification and decision-making.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of different management strategies (endoscopic vs. open). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study who developed laryngeal stenosis following partial laryngectomy for LSCC between December 2011 and December 2023. Patient demographics, etiological factors, and therapeutic interventions were systematically analyzed to evaluate clinical outcomes and summarize management experience. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 61 patients (4 females, 57 males) aged 25-77 years old. The overall decannulation rate was 52.5% (32/61). Endoscopic treatments included laser, balloon dilation and laser combined with balloon dilation, with a decannulation rate of 64.71%, 33.3%, and 45.45%, respectively. Of the 45 patients who received a single endoscopic treatment, successful decannulation was achieved in 25 cases (55.6%), while among the 11 patients that received multiple endoscopic treatment, only 3 (27.3%) patients attained successful decannulation. In contrast, open laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) with T-tube placement showed superior outcomes, with an 80% (4/5) decannulation rate. Among the 61 patients with laryngeal stenosis, those who underwent endoscopic treatment did not require postoperative nasogastric feeding, and their postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter compared to those who underwent LTR with T-tube. CONCLUSION: Laser-assisted endoscopic techniques is recommended as the initial treatment for laryngeal stenosis following partial laryngectomy due to its minimally invasive nature and faster recovery. However, for patients who fail initial endoscopic treatment, LTR with T-tube is often recommended due to its higher decannulation rate, rather than repeated endoscopic attempts.</description>

METHODS: Patients were stratified into the Preservation Group, Reconstruction Group, and Disconnection Group, retrospectively analyzed objective measures (from medical records and operative reports) and subjective measures (using the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System [SFGS] and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation [FaCE] scale) across the three patient groups. RESULTS: No significant differences in recurrence or mortality were observed between Reconstruction and Disconnection groups (p &gt; 0.05). Facial nerve reconstruction significantly improves outcomes in patients with high-risk parotid malignancies (p &lt; 0.05), despite higher-risk profiles in the reconstruction cohort. This improvement remained stable over time, showing no significant decline (p &gt; 0.05). Venous nerve conduit trap yielded superior facial nerve function and QoL versus end-to-end repair (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Facial nerve reconstruction effectively improves outcomes in parotid malignancy surgery. Venous nerve conduit trap application is better than end-to-end repair.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in surgically treated patients with primary oral cavity (OCSCC) or laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). METHODS: This retrospective single-center study included 394 patients with OCSCC or LSCC who underwent surgery with curative intent. Preoperative blood samples were analyzed to assess platelet, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts, as well as T-cell subpopulations (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+). Composite ratios-including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII)-were evaluated for their correlation with global (GR), local (LR), and distant (DR) recurrence risk. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified elevated platelet counts, PLR, SII, and neutrophil levels as significantly associated with increased GR (p = 0.0001, p = 0.0014, p = 0.0058 and p = 0.016, respectively) and LR risk, with the exception of neutrophil levels (p = 0.0002, p = 0.0008, p = 0.0072, respectively). In contrast, higher CD4+/CD3+ (p = 0.038) and CD4+/CD8+ (p = 0.045) ratios were associated with reduced DR risk. Multivariate analysis confirmed platelet count as an independent predictor for GR (p = 0.0001) and LR (p = 0.0002), while a high CD4+/CD8+ ratio (p = 0.045) was independently protective against DR. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the prognostic relevance of platelet-related inflammatory markers and circulating T-cell ratios in recurrence risk among HNSCC patients. The differential associations with local versus distant recurrence underscore the complex interplay between systemic inflammation and adaptive immunity. Prospective validation is warranted to confirm these biomarkers' utility.</description>

Currently, there is no universally accepted treatment approach, but both conservative and surgical management options have been proposed. We present the outcomes of surgically treated cases and propose our surgical strategy for complete management. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to identify temporal bone ORN cases that were primarily treated surgically at two centres between 2005 and January 2025. We recorded and analysed patients' demographics, the anatomic site of the primary tumors and assessed hearing and other postoperative outcomes. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of ORN of the temporal bone have been identified. Management for these cases varied: six were treated with canaloplasty, two had mastoidectomy with reconstruction, three had lateral temporal bone resection with blind sac closure, three were treated with petrosectomy and blind sac closure. The mean age at diagnosis was 63 years, and half of the cases involved males. The most common site of the primary tumor that received RT was the nasopharynx. CONCLUSION: Surgery is an effective management option for recalcitrant temporal bone ORN. The surgical strategy for temporal bone ORN is guided by disease extent and hearing status. As there are no standardised recommendations for its management, future research is necessary.</description>

This review aims to examine the effects of exercise and physiotherapy interventions on various outcomes in individuals who have undergone HNC surgery. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published within the past decade, yielding 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. RESULTS: Except for one preoperative instruction session, all interventions were implemented postoperatively. The most frequently evaluated outcomes included shoulder, jaw, and swallowing function, as well as postoperative symptoms. Across studies, exercise programs with varying content consistently improved shoulder mobility, swallowing function, and symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Evidence from current studies demonstrates that exercise interventions contribute to improved functional outcomes and reduced symptom burden, supporting their inclusion as a core component of standard care in patients who have undergone head and neck cancer surgery.</description>

METHODS: We established an open-source pipeline to quantify vascular area (VA) in both the inner tumor (InT) and invasive tumor front (ITF) regions from CD31-stained whole-slide images (discovery cohort, n = 66). The associations between VA and patient survival were assessed via univariate and multivariate analyses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort (n = 70) immunostained with CD34. RESULTS: VA was significantly higher in the InT region compared to the ITF (p = 0.0079). A higher VA in the ITF was independently associated with favorable overall survival (discovery: HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.11-0.73, p = 0.009; validation: HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.07-0.47, p &lt; 0.001) and disease-free survival (discovery: HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14-0.81, p = 0.015; validation: HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.11-0.53, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide the first evidence that high VA in the ITF is associated with a better prognosis in OSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

METHODS: This study enrolled patients with OSCC from 2000 to 2020, and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model examined the risk factors on survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 885 OSCC patients were included, with the most common tumor subsites: oral tongue (41.9%), gingiva (31.8%), and floor of mouth (16.0%). Gingival and floor of mouth showed a higher proportion of advanced stage (65.8%, 66.9%) and significantly poorer OS (3-year: 63.0%, 57.0%; 5-year: 49.8%, 37.3%) and RFS (3-year: 59.1%, 61.3%; 5-year: 55.5%, 57.0%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly reduced mortality in gingival cancer (HR = 0.598), while tobacco exposure (HR = 1.952) was associated with a significant increase in mortality in floor of mouth cancer. CONCLUSION: Gingival cancer and floor of mouth cancer have a worse prognosis, and thus require greater attention throughout the entire management process.</description>

However, their functional contribution to tumor progression remains unclear. METHODS: We identified and characterized a subset of mitotically active (MA)-PGCCs in human oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens and cell lines. Mitotic activity and cell cycle was assessed using immunofluorescence, time-lapse microscopy and FUCCI. We evaluated the interactions between MA-PGCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), focusing on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed using cell viability assays. RESULTS: MA-PGCCs exhibited both bipolar and multipolar mitosis, generating heterogeneous progeny that contributed to genomic instability. These cells increased the number of CAFs with elevated TGF-β expression, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing resistance to 5-FU. Mechanistically, enhanced reactive oxygen species in MA-PGCCs upregulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR, promoting plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β secreted from adjacent CAFs. Upregulation of TGF-β receptors in MA-PGCCs further amplified TGF-β signaling, accelerating EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify MA-PGCCs as a proliferative subpopulation that promotes EMT and chemoresistance through a TGF-β-uPA/uPAR feedback loop. Targeting this pathway may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive tumors enriched in MA-PGCCs.</description>

While increasingly used, evidence in oncologic populations remains limited. Our objective was to review JIAD in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and its outcomes. METHODS: Our systematic review was conducted following a predefined protocol (PROSPERO CRD420251043510). Our search strategy was executed on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from January 2013 to October 2025. Studies with HNC patients of all ages who underwent JIAD were included. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies were included with 57 patients. Common tumour characteristics included mandibular location (n = 31; 54.4 %) and squamous cell carcinoma pathology (n = 37; 64.9 %). A fibular free flap was used in all cases (n = 57; 100 %). Majority underwent adjuvant therapy (n = 36; 63.2 %). Prosthesis survival was reported in 6 studies (n = 25/32; 78.1 %) with follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 52 months. Prosthesis removal was commonly due to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (n = 6; 10.5 %). All irradiated implants had successful early osseointegration (n = 99; 100 %). Delayed implant failure was reported in 4 patients (n = 4/36; 11.1 %) with 11 implants in radiotherapy field (n = 11/99; 11.1 %). CONCLUSION: JIAD for HNC patients can have high success in majority of select patients/defects. Although early osseointegration rates were high, oncologic patients receiving adjuvant radiation may remain at elevated risk for ORN-associated prosthesis failure. As such, the risks and benefits of JIAD should be carefully reviewed with the patient, and cancer staging should also be considered.</description>

METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD. Proactive adherence-supporting factors facilitate high adherence in this population. Both real and sham HD-tDCS proved safe, feasible, and well tolerated.

Proton conformal FLASH treatment aims to deliver pencil beam scanning (PBS) Bragg Peaks to the tumor region with UHDR. In this work, we conducted a treatment planning study for head and neck (H&amp;N) re-irradiation patients using a research-version of a commercial TPS paired with conformal FLASH hardware integrated into a nozzle of a clinical cyclotron-based system. METHODS: Fifteen H&amp;N patients were planned for re-irradiation of 40 GyRBE in 5 fractions to the area of intact tumor. The TPS was configured with validated UHDR beam measurement to generate optimized patient FLASH plans with one or two beams, delivered as single-beam-per-fraction (SBPF). Each beam consists of a deliverable mono-energetic PBS map, a 3D-printable conformal energy modulator design, a selection of aluminum range shifter plates, and a brass aperture. Python scripts with machine-specific delivery timing parameters were used for Monte Carlo dose and dose rate calculations. Clinical VMAT and IMPT plans were also generated for dosimetric comparison. RESULTS: All plans met the tumor target and OAR planning objectives. Conformal FLASH plans showed very similar dose distributions to the clinical IMPT plans. Compared to VMAT plans, both IMPT and FLASH plans have reduced low dose region, maximum cord dose D0.03 cc (8.37 ± 0.94 vs. 3.19 ± 3.81 and 4.32 ± 3.12 GyRBE, respectively), contra-lateral parotid mean dose (1.88 ± 0.99 vs. 0.00 ± 0.01 and 0.00 ± 0.00 GyRBE, respectively) and contra-lateral submandibular gland mean dose (2.49 ± 1.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.13 and 0.19 ± 0.19 GyRBE, respectively). With 500nA quasi-continuous nozzle beam current, the mean dose-averaged dose rate in CTVs of these 15 patients achieved 95.75 ± 22.78 Gy/s. CONCLUSIONS: - We report the deliverable proton conformal FLASH treatment plans for H&amp;N re-irradiation patients using the innovative hardware configuration and measured beam data in our institution. The FLASH plans have very similar plan qualities to clinical IMPT proton plans and were deliverable with our proton machine. The machine specific 3D dose rate distribution can be calculated and displayed in the TPS.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS &gt; 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P &lt; 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P &lt; 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P &lt; 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P &lt; 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P&lt; .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools.</description>

The purpose of this study is to compare sociodemographic factors, main tumor characteristics, treatment modalities, and survival rates between cancer patients managed within a prison hospitalization unit (PHU) and those treated in a community hospital. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted, comparing 63 cancer patients from the PHU with 129 matched controls from the general population, matched by tumor type and age. Sociodemographic variables, risk factors, tumor types, treatment and survival were analyzed. Chi-square tests and Student's t tests were used for group comparisons, and Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests were applied for survival analysis. The statistical significance level considered was 5% (SPSS v29). RESULTS: The prison population had a higher prevalence of smoking (74.6% vs. 60.5%), alcohol consumption (50.8% vs. 36.4%), and other substance use (25.4% vs. 14.7%) (p &lt; 0.001). The most common types of tumors were gastrointestinal (12%), prostate (9%), and head and neck (9%). Survival was lower for head/neck cancer patients in the PHU and higher in lung cancer patients (p &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Incarcerated cancer patients presented a higher prevalence of risk factors but received similar oncological treatments compared to community controls. Survival was poorer for head and neck cancers and unexpectedly better for lung cancer, although these findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size. The integrated prison-hospital model may reduce treatment disparities, but barriers to early diagnosis and follow-up remain.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and SinoMed Database, from their inception until August 6, 2024. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of Mepitel film on radiodermatitis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Traditional meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies involving 2,313 cancer patients were included. The pooled analysis indicated that Mepitel significantly reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.50, I2 = 67%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to the control groups. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, Mepitel reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.46, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.0001), breast cancer (OR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.68, I2 = 24%, P = 0.0004), and various malignancies (OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.16, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.00001). Mepitel use was also associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe skin injury in radiotherapy patients (RTOG grade II OR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.42, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade III OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.30, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade IV OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, P = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the severity of radiation-induced skin damage (combined RISRAS score, MD= -0.74 95% CI -1.02 to -0.46, I2 = 95%, P &lt; 0.00001; researcher RISRAS score MD= -0.47 95% CI -0.67 to -0.27, I2 = 90%, P &lt; 0.00001; and patient RISRAS score MD= -1.19 95% CI -1.33 to -1.05, I2 = 39%, P &lt; 0.00001). Additionally, patients treated with Mepitel experienced fewer cases of moist desquamation (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.83, I2 = 58%, P = 0.010), and shorter healing times (MD= -4.73, 95%CI -7.16 to -2.30, I2 = 98%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Mepitel interventions significantly reduced RTOG grades and RISRAS scores, decreased the risk of moist desquamation, and shortened healing times for radiation-induced dermatitis in cancer patients. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the relationship between Mepitel and radiation dermatitis in this patient population.</description>

This study investigates the recurrence and MT rates in an Iranian patient cohort with OED, evaluating associations with demographic factors, lifestyle habits, and histopathologic grading systems, with the aim of providing population-specific prognostic insights and enhancing disease prediction and patient outcomes. METHODS: This mixed cohort study included 89 surgically treated patients with OED, followed for 24-168 months. Demographic data, smoking and alcohol consumption history, recurrence, and MT status were collected from medical records. Histopathological grading was performed using both the WHO 2017 classification and a binary grading system. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression, and statistical tests were applied to identify prognostic factors. A p-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: During follow-up, 22.5% (20/89) of patients experienced recurrence, and 30.3% (27/89) underwent MT. The tongue was the most common site for OED (48.3%), recurrence (55%), and MT (44.4%). Males were more frequently affected than females (60.7% vs. 39.3%,), but females tended to remain cancer-free more often. Smoking and alcohol consumption did not significantly influence cancer development. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 50% of MT cases occurred after about 108 months (mean: 114.8 months). The combined mean survival for recurrence and MT was 92.8 months. Cox regression identified WHO grading as the only statistically significant predictor of MT and recurrence/MT (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The WHO grading system plays a crucial role in predicting the likelihood of OED recurrence and malignant transformation. Lesion location showed only a non-significant trend, suggesting that its effect may be mediated by grade. These findings highlight the importance of using grading-based risk assessments and ensuring close follow-up care to better manage OED and improve patient outcomes.</description>

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are emerging as promising biomarkers for predicting ICB response. Early characterization of ctDNA and TCR dynamics may enable timely treatment adjustments before clinical or radiological progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IO-KIN study (NCT04606940) is a single-center, prospective trial involving 15 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Blood samples (n=104) were collected across seven timepoints from baseline to day 29. ctDNA was analyzed using a personalized assay (Signatera), and peripheral TCR repertoires were profiled using CapTCR-seq in eight patients. RESULTS: A decline in ctDNA after day 8 was associated with radiological response, longer progression-free survival, and a trend toward improved overall survival. TCR repertoires transiently diversified between days 8-22, with longer diversification windows in patients showing sustained ctDNA decline. Using the GLIPHII algorithm, an EBV-specific TCR signature was identified and persisted in patients with clinical benefit. Additional TCR signatures, potentially recognizing tumor-associated antigens, emerged as early as day 3 and were linked to positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous early monitoring of ctDNA and TCR dynamics reveals key determinants of ICB outcomes in R/M HNSCC. The transient nature of TCR diversification emphasizes the importance of precise sample timing to guide early therapeutic decisions and improve patient outcomes.</description>

This study evaluated BM management strategies and patients' outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DTC and BM at Tel Aviv Sourasky and Rabin Medical Centers between 1985 and 2024. Clinical features, histopathology, treatments, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified: 11 (55%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma, 8 (40%) had follicular carcinoma and 1 had Hurtle cell carcinoma. BM treatments included neurosurgical resection (n = 9), stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 14), and whole-brain radiotherapy (n = 6). Median survival following BM diagnosis was 16.2 months. Patients who did not undergo surgical resection had significantly shorter survival than those whose BM were resected (13 vs. 80 months, p = 0.03). Survival was also worse among patients receiving systemic therapy at the time BM developed (8.9 vs. 80 months, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Unresected BM of DTC and those arising during systemic therapy portend high mortality.</description>

Circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a minimally invasive biomarker able to improve early detection, assess minimal residual disease, monitor systemic treatment response and identify therapeutic targets. This literature review aims to critically synthesise evidence from the past decade on the clinical use of ctDNA in both HPV-related and HPV-unrelated HNCs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A literature review was performed using PubMed and Cochrane Library on March 11th 2024, updated on November 21st, 2025, using the keywords: "circulating tumour DNA", "head and neck cancer", "ctHPV-DNA associated with HNSCC", "liquid biopsy and HNSCC". RESULTS: After evaluation of 363 articles identified, 92 were included. ctDNA has been investigated for screening, diagnosis, prognostic stratification, treatment-response assessment, relapse detection and identification of therapeutic targets. However, performance varies considerably across studies due to methodological and biological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: ctDNA shows strong potential for response assessment and post-treatment monitoring, particularly in HPV-related disease. Nevertheless, its integration into clinical practice requires methodological standardisation and validation in larger prospective studies.</description>

But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Feng Y, Al-Aroomi MA, Chen J, Song S, Jiang C, Wang J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107824'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107824&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41418401/'&gt;41418401&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: Patients who undergo solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are at an increased risk of developing oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) due to prolonged immunosuppression. The specific characteristics and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in these post-transplant patients are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the risk, characteristics, and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in post-transplant patients. METHODS: This study analyzed the clinical baseline characteristics of OSCC patients with pathological confirmation who had undergone organ transplantation (study group) and non-transplant OSCC patients (control group), all of whom were monitored with comprehensive follow-up. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate whether organ transplantation status was an independent risk factor affecting survival. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were enrolled (study group, n = 17; control group, n = 86). The median age at OSCC diagnosis for study group was 53 years, with tumors primarily located on the tongue (35.3 %), buccal (17.6 %), and gingiva (11.8 %). Control group had a similar median age, with tumors mostly located on the tongue (64.0 %), buccal (16.3 %), and gingiva (8.1 %). Except for one transplant recipient who received conservative management, all patients underwent surgical resection. Cox multivariate analysis identified tumor recurrence (p = 0.002), tumor size (p = 0.016), and vascular invasion (p = 0.006) as significant adverse factors affecting survival. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the importance of organ transplantation history in managing OSCC. Regular screening is essential for early detection and improved survival, particularly under immunosuppressive conditions, in this high-risk group.</description>

Our previous studies demonstrated that the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) LINC-PINT enhances the radiosensitivity of NPC cells. However, the clinical relevance of functional polymorphisms in LINC-PINT remains unclear. METHODS: A total of 199 Chinese NPC patients who received concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy were enrolled. The association between the LINC-PINT rs1059698 polymorphism and short-term treatment efficacy (assessed 3 months post-treatment) was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. LINC-PINT expression in NPC tissues was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A luciferase reporter assay was performed to assess the effect of rs1059698 on miR-646 binding. Eight machines were further employed learning algorithms to construct predictive models for treatment efficacy. RESULTS: NPC patients with a complete response (CR) showed significantly higher LINC-PINT expression than those with partial response (PR) or progressive disease (PD) (P &lt; 0.05). The rs1059698 CC genotype was significantly associated with an improved treatment response (CR vs. PR + PD, OR = 0.189, 95% CI: 0.042-0.860, P = 0.031). Individuals carrying the CC genotype also exhibited approximately 1.5-fold higher LINC-PINT expression compared to AA genotype carriers (P &lt; 0.001). Functional analysis showed that the A-to-C substitution at rs1059698 disrupted miR-646 binding to LINC-PINT. Additionally, the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model incorporating rs1059698 and clinical variables achieved moderate predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.765 in training and 0.641 in validation). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the rs1059698 polymorphism were associated with NPC treatment response possibly by influencing the expression of LINC-PINT or altering miRNA-lncRNA interaction. LINC-PINT rs1059698 may serve as a predictive biomarker for chemoradiotherapy efficacy in NPC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Scholfield DW, Boe LA, Eagan A, Levyn H, Kavanagh F, Tuttle RM, Shaha AR, Cracchiolo JR, Shah JP, Wong RJ, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4653'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41411004/'&gt;41411004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) with lateral neck metastases (N1b) are usually treated with total thyroidectomy (TT), neck dissection, and adjuvant radioactive iodine (RAI). This philosophy comes with higher risks of complications and sequela than thyroid lobectomy (TL) and neck dissection alone. There are no prior studies on patients from the Western hemisphere that compare survival and recurrence outcomes between these groups. OBJECTIVE: To compare recurrence and survival outcomes in propensity-matched TL vs TT + RAI patients who presented with ipsilateral N1b PTC at a tertiary cancer center in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort propensity-matched study was conducted at a single US tertiary cancer center included 37 TL patients and 37 of 561 TT + RAI patients (after excluding patients with M1 disease), with a median (IQR) follow-up of 113 (58-241) and 90 (48-185) months, respectively. Adult patients with PTC with lateral neck node metastases (N1b) were identified from a thyroid cancer database. The study included patients undergoing surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1986 to 2020, inclusive, and the study was conducted from 2024 to 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Of 598 total individuals, the median (IQR) age was 41 (33-55) years, and 341 (57%) were female. The 5-year OS was 96.9% in the TL group and 96.8% in the TT + RAI group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03-1.58). The 5-year DSS was 96.7% in the TL group and 100% in the TT +RAI group. The 5-year RFS was 89.8% in the TL group and 88.9% in the TT + RAI group (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.39-5.58). The survival rates did not change between 5 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that a select group of patients with N1b PTC treated with TL had no important difference in survival and recurrence outcomes compared with patients treated with TT + RAI. Therefore, TL is an effective and safe treatment option in carefully selected and appropriately counselled patients with N1b PTC with unilateral tumors and low-volume regional lymph node metastases without clinical extranodal extension.</description>

However, whether pathologic treatment response is a meaningful surrogate end point for survival has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the association between pathologic treatment response and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after neoadjuvant ICI. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed from January 1, 2000, through May 31, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed studies investigating neoadjuvant ICI for the treatment of mucosal HNSCC in patients 18 years and older were identified. Full-length English-language articles that presented pathologic treatment response and survival data (OS and/or DFS) and any association between the 2 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three blinded reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, pathologic treatment response data, and survival data, including hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs when available, according to PRISMA guideline. Data were compiled for statistical analysis to calculate DFS, OS, and HRs using a random-effects model. The I2 index was used to report data heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: HRs for the association of pathologic treatment response with DFS and OS. RESULTS: Eleven trials involving 451 patients met inclusion criteria, with 368 patients included in this meta-analysis. Nine nonrandomized and 2 randomized studies were included, including 7 cohort studies, 2 randomized clinical trials, and 2 retrospective cohort studies, each with a different neoadjuvant ICI regimen. Pooled analysis demonstrated that overall (primary tumor plus lymph node) partial pathologic response (PPR; ≤50% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; I2 = 2.1%) and major pathologic response (MPR; ≤10% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.93; I2 = 0.0%) were both associated with improved DFS up to 2 years. PPR and MPR were not associated with improved OS. Nine of 11 studies were at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study findings suggest that overall PPR and MPR are associated with improved DFS. These data provide additional support for the potential use of pathologic treatment response as a surrogate for DFS after neoadjuvant ICI in resectable mucosal HNSCC.</description>

This has prompted extensive research into biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes beyond conventional staging systems. This mini review summarizes findings from the existing literature to provide a comprehensive examination of the prognostic significance of malignancy and progression factors in OSCC, offering insights into future perspectives. There is clear evidence that molecular and protein-based biomarkers, in addition to established clinical and histopathological features, such as lymph node involvement, extranodal spread, and depth of invasion, strongly correlate with overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Integrating different gene expression signatures, microRNA (miRNA) profiles, and changes in intracellular signaling pathways enables more differentiated risk stratification. Protein biomarkers such as cyclin D1, trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (TROP2), urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), and E-cadherin have been shown to provide clinically useful prognostic information. These results underscore the importance of incorporating biomarkers into individualized risk stratification to enhance personalized treatment regimens and outcomes for OSCC patients. Currently, however, established clinical and histopathological parameters, as well as a limited number of validated molecular profiles, remain the most reliable prognostic indicators. While identifying new biomarkers is promising, establishing standardized protocols and implementing careful prospective validation are essential to ensuring their seamless integration into standard clinical practice.</description>

Artificial intelligence (AI) and radiomics offer promise for nodal assessment, but clinical utility and reporting quality remain variable. METHODS: This systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies published between 2020-2025. Eleven eligible studies (4 core, 7 supportive) addressed ENE (n=2) or LNM prediction (n=2), with additional supportive studies on segmentation, lymphatic spread modeling, MRI radiomics, and outcomes modeling. Extracted variables included study characteristics, performance metrics, validation, calibration, and unit of analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using PROBAST; reporting quality was evaluated with TRIPOD. Due to heterogeneity and limited study numbers, no meta-analysis was performed; results were narratively synthesized. For ENE, we report study-level accuracy, decision-curve analysis (DCA), and per-1,000 management impact. RESULTS: All core studies were CT-based. The task-specific deep-learning ENE model achieved AUC 0.86 with balanced operating points, while the generalist LVLM (Large Vision-Language Model) reached sensitivity 1.00 with specificity 0.34. DCA favored the DL model across thresholds 0.10-0.40, showing fewer unnecessary dissections per 1,000 patients than Treat-all or L(V)LM. For LNM, discrimination was high (AUC 0.865-0.919), calibration was reported, and one study included external validation, though threshold-level sensitivity/specificity were missing. External validation was reported in 25% of core studies, calibration in 50%; TRIPOD adherence was 74.5% overall, with frequent under-reporting of blinding and missing-data handling. CONCLUSIONS: AI and radiomics show promising potential for preoperative prediction of ENE and LNM in oropharyngeal cancer. Task-specific deep-learning models achieve balanced discrimination, while generalist LVLMs provide high recall at lower specificity. For LNM, encouraging performance is reported, but limited external validation and absent standardized thresholds still preclude clinical use. Broader validation and harmonized reporting are essential before translation into practice. REGISTRATION/PROTOCOL: Not registered; methods followed PRISMA/TRIPOD/PROBAST guidance.</description>

Despite advances in treatment, reliable biomarkers for the early detection and monitoring of HNC remain lacking. The α-Gal carbohydrate epitope, absent in humans but present in other mammals, has garnered interest due to the natural presence of anti-α-Gal antibodies in the human immune repertoire, comprising approximately 1% of total circulating IgG. We investigated the role of anti-α-Gal IgG as a potential biomarker by performing ELISA on serum samples from a cohort of 11 patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck. Eight were older male patients, most of whom lived in rural areas and engaged in manual occupations. High rates of tobacco (81.8%) and alcohol consumption (63.6%) were observed, in line with established risk factors for HNC. These individuals showed significantly elevated anti-α-Gal antibody titers compared to non-cancer controls. Chemotherapy with cisplatin did not markedly affect antibody levels, suggesting consistent immune reactivity across treatment status. These results suggest that anti-α-Gal antibodies may serve as promising biomarker candidates in HNC and warrant further investigation to clarify their potential diagnostic and immunotherapeutic applications.</description>

METHODS: The research subjects were patients with head and neck tumors who underwent free flap reconstruction in our hospital, The clinical-relevant data of all patients were collected. Patients were randomly divided into training set and validation set at the ratio of 7:3. Univariate and multivariate analyses using Logistic regression were performed to identify independent risk factors for postoperative complications. The random forest algorithm was further used to construct the prediction model, and the performance of the model was verified by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curve evaluation, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: A total of 341 patients were included in the study, and 82 cases (24.05%) had postoperative complications. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, operation time, bleeding volume, flap type and flap area were the independent risk factors for complications after free flap reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer (P &lt; 0.05). The contribution magnitudes of each variable obtained from the random forest model was flap resection area, intraoperative bleeding volume, age, operation time, flap type and concomitant hypertension. The calibration curve of the constructed Nomogram model showed that the predicted value was in good agreement with the actual value, and the AUC of the ROC curve was 0.793 (95% CI: 0.711-0.874) and 0.788 (95% CI: 0.665-0.912), respectively, showing good prediction performance. The DCA analysis indicated that the model had good clinical application value. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression and random forest algorithm can effectively analyze the influencing factors of complications after free flap reconstruction in patients with head and neck cancer and construct accurate prediction model. This model can provide a scientific theoretical reference for the prevention of postoperative complications and facilitate the precise optimization of individualized prevention plans based on risk prediction.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control study including clinical information and DNA samples from 792 subjects from the University of Pittsburgh dental clinics. The cases were 264 subjects diagnosed with oral potential malignant disorders or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Controls were matched by sex and age in a 1:2 ratio. χ2 tests detected differences between groups regarding ethnicity, race, and covariates. A Post-hoc test with Bonferroni and Holm corrections accounted for multiple comparisons between groups. A standard χ2 residual test was used to investigate which ethnicity category contributed most to the association. Multiple logistic regression models were used to obtain the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and to detect the association between single-nucleotide variants and outcomes, stratified by ethnicity and race. RESULTS: The risk of having the outcomes was 78% greater in those patients who self-reported as African American (OR, 1.78; P = .002; 95% confidence interval, 1.225-2.592). Minor allele G (rs9879992-GSK3B) increased the risk for the outcomes in patients who self-reported as African American (OR, 1.85; P = .002; 95% confidence interval, 1.236-2.772). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported race and ethnicity were associated with oral potential malignant disorder/oral cancer. Future studies using ancestry informative markers can confirm these findings.</description>

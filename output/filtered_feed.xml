      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yoshino Y, Masui K, Takenaka T, Kawabata K, Aibe N, Kimoto T, Nagasawa S, Kajikawa T, Ikeda S, Kawamoto T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiation oncology (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s13014-025-02775-9'&gt;10.1186/s13014-025-02775-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41526918/'&gt;41526918&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Surgery is the primary therapy for hard palate cancer, but this sometime worsens oral function and unavailable for patients with several comorbidities. Radiotherapy represents an alternative curative treatment option to preserve oral function, however, there are few reports on the use of radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate (SCCHP). High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy has been known as an effective treatment for SCCHP, which seems to be less invasive when mold technique is used. In our hospital, the HDR customized mold brachytherapy (HDR- customized MBT) is available for patients with SCCHP. This study aimed to report the efficacy and toxicity of HDR- customized MBT for patients with early-stage SCCHP. CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients with early-stage SCCHP were treated with mainly HDR- customized MBT between June 2015 and May 2023. Three of four patients received the combined radiotherapy: one patient underwent short-term external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) before the HDR- customized MBT; two patients underwent single-fraction interstitial brachytherapy before HDR- customized MBT. The total biological effective dose was 77-110 Gy (α/β = 10). All patients completed HDR- customized MBT with or without the combined radiotherapy and experienced no local recurrence. The acute toxicity was only mucositis limited to the irradiated area: one case with EBRT developed grade 2 mucositis. Only this case had late grade 2 mucositis; no late adverse events were observed in the other cases. No oral dysfunction or cosmetic problems occurred in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study might show that HDR-customized MBT is useful for early-stage SCCHP and might be an alternative curative treatment option for them to preserve oral function.</description>

This study aimed to identify the optimal age threshold and evaluate its association with overall survival (OS) to improve risk stratification and inform individualized treatment strategies. METHODS: Data were extracted from the SEER database (2018-2021), the University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, and the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCC). Only HPV-positive OPC cases with complete survival records were included. The optimal age threshold was identified using restricted cubic spline modeling in combination with a recursive partitioning approach. Prognostic factors beyond HPV status and AJCC eighth edition stage were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to construct a risk stratification model. The primary endpoint was OS. RESULTS: Of the 10 283 eligible patients (87.9% male; median age, 62 years), 2.7% had distant metastases at diagnosis. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed that 62 years of age represents an important critical threshold. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that patients younger than 62 years exhibited significantly improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70; p &lt; 0.001). RPA stratified patients into five risk groups with distinct 2-year OS: extremely low (96.8%), low (93.7%), intermediate (86.1%), high (74.6%), and extremely high risk (47.5%). Among patients classified in the extremely low-risk group (T0-2N0-1M0 and younger than 62 years), no significant difference in OS was observed between those treated with radiotherapy alone and those treated with chemoradiotherapy. External validation in the UHN (N = 843) and NCC (N = 167) cohorts suggested that extremely low-risk patients might be spared concurrent chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a risk stratification model for patients with p16-positive OPC based on the AJCC eighth edition staging and age. Patients in the extremely low-risk group may derive limited benefit from concurrent chemotherapy, suggesting that its omission could be considered in selected patients and may help guide the design of future de-escalation trials.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao YD, Sun HW, Zha CP, Wang ZH, Sun CZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41524932/'&gt;41524932&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: This study aimed to comprehensively analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SGSC) using a large population-based cohort to determine temporal patterns, identify independent survival predictors, and evaluate treatment effectiveness for optimizing clinical management. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with SGSC between 2011 and 2021 were included. We analyzed clinicopathological features, incidence trends, and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 36.5 months, the overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.93% and 86.53%, respectively. The incidence of SGSC has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of 6.3 cases per year in 2011-2013 to 29.3 cases per year in 2019-2021. This increase was predominantly driven by early-stage (I/II) tumors (75.9%), with the parotid gland being the most common primary site. Multivariable analysis identified age &gt; 55 years and AJCC Stage IV disease as independent poor prognostic factors. Surgical intervention, including local tumor excision and glandectomy, was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Notably, patients who received a combination of surgery and radiotherapy had better outcomes compared to those who received either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study with extended follow-up clarifies the rising incidence and early-stage predominance of SGSC. Age, TNM stage, and surgical treatment were identified as key prognostic factors.</description>

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on studies employing TORS in HPV-associated OPSCC. Meta-analysis of continuous measures, proportions, and comparison of weighted proportion and relative risk were performed for patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies, comprising 16,129 adults treated with TORS for OPSCC, were included. The mean age was 59.5 years (SD 2.08) (range 18-93), with an average follow-up of 43.4 months (SD 13.36); 83.5% of the cohort was male, and 85.6% had HPV-positive OPSCC. In the HPV-positive group, TORS survival rates were 91.0% at 1 year, 94.9% at 3 years, and 89.8% at 5 years. In comparison, the HPV-negative group had survival rates of 92.3%, 84.2%, and 72.9%, respectively. Significant survival differences were observed between cohorts at 3 and 5 years (P &lt; .0001). The HPV-positive group had a significantly higher likelihood of 5-year overall survival compared to the HPV-negative group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34) Recurrence rates in HPV-positive patients were 2.0% local, 3.1% regional, and 5.3% locoregional, whereas HPV-negative patients had recurrence rates of 7.6% local, 6.0% regional, and 9.1% locoregional (P = .0037, .2143, .426, respectively). Distant metastasis rates were 5.6% in HPV-positive and 10.2% in HPV-negative patients (P = .0033). CONCLUSION: The higher survival rates and lower recurrences in HPV-positive OPSCC patients compared to their HPV-negative counterparts reflects the favorable long-term oncologic outcome seen in HPV-associated OPSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Osbourne G, Devlin A, Walsh N, Hardcastle N, Moore A, Rischin PD, Kenny PL, Porceddu PS, Wratten C, Macann A, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.058'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.058&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520894/'&gt;41520894&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Unilateral radiotherapy (URT) is an effective treatment strategy in selected patients with lateralized tonsil cancer. However, there is a lack of established planning guidelines for URT treatment leading to suboptimal optimization of contralateral and midline organs at risk (OARs). This study aimed to re-optimize URT plans to maximize sparing of midline and contralateral OAR's while maintaining target coverage, providing dosimetric guidelines for URT planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment plan data for patients treated with URT on XXXX were re-optimized using Eclipse V16.01. All relevant midline and OAR contours were contoured to align with international OAR consensus guidelines. Treatment plans were re-optimized, aiming for maximal midline and contralateral sparing while maintaining XXXX protocol-mandated target coverage (GTV: D100%&gt;95%; PTV: D95%&gt;95%). A second re-optimisation was performed to align with NRG acceptance criteria (PTV: D95%&gt;100%). RESULTS: All re-optimized plans achieved the XXXX and NRG protocol target volume coverage. Clinically meaningful reductions in dose to the pharyngeal constrictors (trial delivered plan vs XXXX re-optimized plan, median of mean dose, 48.5 Gy vs 37.4 Gy, estimated mean difference [ED] -9.5Gy, p&lt;0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (14.9 vs 6.7 Gy, ED -11.0, p&lt;0.001) and larynx (22.1 vs 12.1, ED -12.2, p&lt;0.001). Improvements were also seen in contralateral parotid gland (9.2 vs 4.9, ED -5.0, p&lt;0.001) and oral cavity (39.5 vs 35.9, ED -3.0, p&lt;0.001), which were considered less likely to be clinically relevant. There was no increase in dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral mandible. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this re-optimization study provide planning guidelines to guide dosimetrists and radiation oncologists on achievable OAR sparing when delivering URT.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, non-randomized phase II trial enrolled patients with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory R/M HNSCC. In Cohort A, a single lesion was treated with SBRT while other sites were left unirradiated. In Cohort B, all known oligometastatic lesions were treated with SBRT. Pembrolizumab was administered every 3 weeks in both cohorts. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS). Correlative immune analyses were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using mass cytometry and TCRβ sequencing. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (6 in Cohort A, 12 in Cohort B). Median PFS was 1.8 months in Cohort A and 5.7 months in Cohort B. The 3-month PFS rate was 17% (1/6) in Cohort A and 67% (8/12) in Cohort B, with an overall response rate of 25% (3/12) in Cohort B and no objective responses in Cohort A. Median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: [0.7-32.9])in Cohort A and 10.1 months (95% CI: [5.8-49.7]) in Cohort B. In Cohort B there were 2 (2/12, 17%) Grade 4 toxicities observed in the setting of re-irradiation. Correlative studies showed that patients with PFS &gt;3 months had higher baseline frequencies of CD8+ central memory T cells and elevated CXCR5 expression on memory B cells. CONCLUSIONS: In anti PD-1-refractory R/M HNSCC, SBRT with pembrolizumab was safe and feasible, suggesting activity when all progressing lesions were treated. Immune profiling describes pre-existing memory T and B cell phenotypes that appear to correlate with treatment benefit. These findings support further study and clinical use of comprehensive SBRT plus PD-1 blockade in this hard-to-treat population.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Elsharief MM, Hassouna AH, Shouman T, Mosallam A, Elbadrawy A, Shawky A, Wahab AA, Abdelfatah SM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111376'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111376&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520731/'&gt;41520731&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Both Transoral laser surgery (TLS) and radiotherapy are used in the treatment of T1aN0 glottic cancer with similar oncological outcomes. Retrospective studies suggest excellent local control with single vocal cord irradiation that targets only the affected vocal cord. So, the aim of this study was to compare the treatment outcome and toxicity of the classic radiotherapy field vs single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI) technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective phase 2 randomized study (clinicaltrial.gov registration NCT05679856). A total of 57 patients with T1aN0 glottic cancer were randomized. 28 were assigned to standard of care whole larynx radiotherapy that covers the whole larynx with a prescription dose of 63 Gy/28 Fractions (Fs) The remaining 29 patients were randomized to single vocal irradiation with a prescription dose of 58.08 Gy/16Fs. The primary endpoint was to prove superiority of SVCI in terms of voice quality by comparing voice handicap index (VHI) between the 2 study arms. Baseline VHI was recorded before treatment, at end of radiotherapy then during each follow up visit. RESULTS: Demographic and patients' characteristics were comparable between the 2 arms. The dose to different organs at risk were statistically lower in the SVCI arm. 2-year local control rate was 100% in SVCI arm and 96% in the whole larynx arm, with no significant difference. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were reported in both treatment arms. Patients in the SVCI arm demonstrated lower VHI scores at 2 months and 1-year post-treatment, with median scores of 4 and 0, respectively, compared with 22 and 21 in the whole-larynx arm. CONCLUSION: SVCI is effective and safe treatment for T1aN0 glottic cancer with comparable local control rates and safe toxicity profile. SVCI was associated with superior voice outcome as evidenced by significantly improved VHI scores compared with whole larynx radiotherapy.</description>

We hypothesized that personalization of fractionation using PSI would increase the percentage of patients achieving a rapid reduction in tumor size during radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage human papillomavirus related squamous cancers of the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center nonrandomized phase 2 single arm trial, 113 patients underwent screening, and 57 patients were consented and enrolled. Pretreatment PSI was calculated, and patients were assigned to 60 - 70 Gy in 30 - 35 fractions given once daily (PSI≤ 0.75) or 60 - 69.6 Gy in in 50 - 58 fractions given twice daily (PSI&gt;0.75). The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of patients with ≥ 32% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks of RT, with a planned sample size of 60 patients, with an interim analysis after 49 patients. Secondary end points included locoregional failure (LRF), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 55 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint were consented and enrolled, and 32 (58%; 95% CI = 44%-71%) met the primary endpoint of ≥ 32% reduction at 4 weeks of RT, meeting criteria for efficacy, leading to early study closure. For the 54 patients evaluable for secondary endpoints, the cumulative incidence of LRF at 2 years was 2% (95% CI: 0-5.8), with a 2-year PFS of 92% (95% CI: 85-100), and a 2 year OS of 96% (95% CI: 91-100). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized RT fractionation based on PSI suggests a promising rate of mid-treatment response with favorable LF, PFS, and OS.

This study, therefore, aims to develop tumor control probability (TCP) models. METHODS: Dose-time modeling of TCP was performed for three key dose descriptors: 3-fraction equivalent dose (3fxED) prescription dose, 3fxED planning target volume (PTV) D95%, and 3fxED PTV D2%. Each dose descriptor was stratified into 4 dose groups using a k-medians clustering algorithm, and the Kaplan-Meier estimator was computed in each group separately to enable time-dependent dose-response modeling. Logistic regression models were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation with model parameters determined separately for 1-year and 2-year local control. RESULTS: This retrospective multicenter analysis included 318 pulmonary metastases from 215 patients. The median 3fxED prescription dose was 45.0 Gy (IQR, 39.2-46.5), corresponding to a biologically effective dose (α/β = 20 Gy) (BED20) of 78.8  Gy (IQR, 64.8-82.5). After a median radiographic follow-up of 13.3 months (IQR, 6.6-32.0), 21 local failures were observed. All models indicated a dose-dependent effect on the local control probability. A local control rate of 95 % was achieved at 1 and 2 years when 3fxED prescription doses and PTV D95% exceeded about 51 Gy (94 Gy BED20), and when PTV D2% reached 66 Gy (139 Gy BED20). CONCLUSION: These TCP models suggest a dose-dependent probability of local control in pulmonary HNSCC metastases treated with SBRT and provide a basis for future clinical assessments in this population.</description>

We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine the survival outcomes and resource utilization of patients with R/M SCCHNC who were treated with nivolumab. METHOD: Patients with R/M SCCHNC were included in the study if they received nivolumab between January 17th 2018 to August 31st 2022 in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), were assessed using Kaplan-Meier. Cox proportional hazard model was used to explore the association between baseline patient characteristics and all-cause death. The incidence of healthcare utilization was estimated using the cumulative incidence function, taking death as a competing event. RESULTS: A total of 498 R/M SCCHNC patients received nivolumab (Mean age 62.9, 78.7 % male). The median OS was 6.0 months (95 % CI: 5.0-7.3) and median time-to-treatment discontinuation was 2.6 months (95 % CI: 2.3-3.0). There is no significant OS difference between older patients (age &gt; 75 years old) and younger patients (p-value 0.73). At 1-year post-nivolumab initiation, the cumulative incidence of emergency department visits is 50.6 % (95 % CI: 46.1-55.0 %) and direct hospitalization is 22.7 % (19.0-26.6 %). CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the survival outcomes of nivolumab were similar to those observed in CheckMate-141 trial. We demonstrated that there is no survival difference between older and younger patients. Furthermore, more than half of patients exaperienced an hospital encounter with the healthcare system, suggesting significant healthcare resource utilization.</description>

The impact of perioperative extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage remains unclear. This study hypothesizes that calculated prophylaxis with piperacillin/tazobactam reduces early-onset SSI in this high-risk population. METHODS: From a microvascular reconstructed cohort, 161 with prior irradiation were retrospectively identified (tumor, N = 101; ORN, N = 60). SSI risk reduction was compared between patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (N = 39) and standard prophylaxis (N = 122). RESULTS: With underlying SSI incidence of 36%, piperacillin/tazobactam showed a fourfold SSI risk reduction (HR 0.24; p = 0.002) across the entire cohort and a fivefold reduction in patients with bone resection (HR 0.17; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses confirmed this effect with a sevenfold reduction in tumor patients (HR 0.14; p = 0.008) and a threefold reduction in ORN patients (HR 0.29; p = 0.04). Extended coverage did not significantly prolong antibiotic treatment times. CONCLUSION: In summary, calculated use of piperacillin/tazobactam in previously irradiated patients requiring microvascular reconstruction appears effective in reducing early-onset SSI.</description>

Despite its high incidence (6.0 per 100,000 males; 2.3 per 100,000 females) and poor prognosis, no molecular biomarkers exist for early detection. Non-invasive sampling could improve diagnosis and patient outcomes. METHODS: This pilot study used RNA sequencing to identify significantly upregulated mRNA targets in swab samples from oral and oropharyngeal SCC patients and healthy probands. After filtering, four potential biomarkers were further validated in 79 samples using RT-qPCR. CombiROC analysis assessed diagnostic performance. Additional RT-qPCR on tumour and normal tissues and fluorescence staining in FFPE tumour sections evaluated expression at mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: A panel of three markers (c-JUN, SFN, HSP90AB1) showed high diagnostic accuracy: 92.3% specificity, 92.3% sensitivity, and AUC of 0.91. Fluorescence staining confirmed significantly higher protein expression in tumour tissues, supporting RNA findings. The panel showed stronger diagnostic performance in men than in women. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising non-invasive biomarker panel for oral and oropharyngeal SCC detection. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm diagnostic value and clarify sex specificity. The approach is adaptable to other tumour types and sample materials, supporting molecular diagnostics. The workflow shows all project steps from sampling to marker localisation in FFPE tissue. In the discovery phase, RNA sequencing was used to find potential mRNA markers in swab samples. Via strict filtering, markers for RT-qPCR were selected and verified in a bigger cohort in the validation phase. Selected markers were then used to do combinatorial analysis to improve the specificity and sensitivity compared to that of the single markers. Finally, markers were verified and localised in primary oral and oropharyngeal SCC FFPE tissue. Created with BioRender.com.</description>

This study evaluated risk-adjusted dental utilization patterns and associated healthcare costs among patients with OOC in Medicare and commercially insured populations. METHODS: Using the 2013-2024 Merative™ MarketScan® Research Databases, individuals with at least one medical claim for OOC were identified and matched 1:1 to non-OOC controls using propensity score matching. Analyses were stratified by insurance type (Medicare vs. commercial). Outcomes included frequency of dental visits, types of dental procedures, treatment modalities, and total annual healthcare costs. RESULTS: The prevalence of OOC was 67 per 100,000 among commercially insured and 397 per 100,000 among Medicare enrollees. Compared with controls, OOC patients were older and predominantly male (all p&lt;0.01). OOC patients had significantly fewer annual dental visits than controls (2.79 vs. 2.98 [Medicare]; 2.81 vs. 3.20 [Commercial], all p&lt;.0001). Restoration and periodontal treatments were the most common dental procedures. Surgical treatment alone was more frequent among OOC patients (20.1% Medicare; 15.6% Commercial). The risk-adjusted total annual healthcare burden was $22,984 for Medicare and $47,542 for Commercial OOC patients (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher medical costs and intensive cancer treatment, OOC patients had fewer dental visits, indicating a gap in survivorship care. IMPACT: These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated medical-dental care models and policies that enhance access to preventive and restorative dental services, potentially reducing complications, improving quality of life, and lowering healthcare costs among OOC survivors.</description>

Its role in reducing postoperative complications in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 415 OSCC patients undergoing radical resection with free flap reconstruction. After propensity score matching, 174 well-matched pairs were analyzed. Patients were divided into a tooth cleaning group (n = 174) and a control group (n = 174). Outcomes included postoperative pneumonia (PP), surgical site infection (SSI), fever, length of stay, and unplanned reoperation were recorded. RESULTS: Preoperative tooth cleaning was significantly associated with lower PP risk (OR = 0.30). Significant independent risk factors for PP included tumor location at the floor of the mouth (OR = 4.70), hypertension (OR = 2.93), and longer operative duration (OR = 1.33 per hour). The radiographic severity of periodontitis was not a significant risk factor for PP. No associations were found between tooth cleaning and other outcomes. Stratified analyses showed significant protective effects in patients aged &gt; 60 years (OR = 0.19), with hypertension (OR = 0.08), periodontitis (OR = 0.07), or surgeries &gt; 5 h (OR = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Preoperative professional tooth cleaning one day before surgery is associated with a reduced risk of PP in OSCC patients.</description>

While associated with poor prognosis in various malignancies, characterization of ISTDs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is limited. METHODS: This single-center cohort study examined 11 cases of PTC with ISTDs. Multi-platform next-generation sequencing analyzing driver mutations and tumor suppressor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was performed on primary tumors, lymph nodes, and ISTDs. Clinical and histopathologic features were compared to a 3:1 matched control cohort. RESULTS: Genomic alterations were identical across paired tumors, lymph nodes, and ISTDs. LOH was present in 78% of cases with driver mutations. Compared to controls, ISTD cases demonstrated increased rates of high lymph node burden (p &lt; 0.01), extranodal extension (p = 0.012), and lymphovascular invasion (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Associated with aggressive disease features, the molecular profiles of ISTDs mirror primary tumors and lymph node metastases.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Adults undergoing parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation between 2018 and 2023 were included. Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 740 tumors were analyzed (353 benign, 387 malignant). Antegrade dissection was performed in 288 cases (194 malignant), retrograde in 334 (167 malignant), and extracapsular in 118 (26 malignant). Transient and permanent facial weakness occurred in 20% and 5% of cases. After adjustment, extracapsular dissection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.7, P = .0058) significantly reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade dissection. Retrograde dissection (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P = .11) demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of transient weakness relative to antegrade dissection. In malignant tumors, outcomes were similar across approaches. Extracapsular dissection was rarely used in malignant disease and reserved for selected cases. Antegrade dissection had longer operative times in benign and malignant tumors (P &lt; .001). Perioperative complication rates, unplanned visits, recurrence, re-operations, ED visits, and readmissions were low and not significantly different across techniques. CONCLUSION: In benign parotidectomy, extracapsular dissection significantly reduced transient facial weakness, while retrograde dissection demonstrated a trend toward reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade. In malignant disease, outcomes were similar across approaches. Selective application of extracapsular and retrograde techniques may optimize facial nerve outcomes and operative efficiency.</description>

However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective secondary analysis used single-institution prospective registries of HNC patients treated with RT who completed the MDASI-HN and a modified barium swallow (MBS) before, during, or after RT. The DynamicImaging Grade ofSwallowing Toxicity(DIGEST) overall (D), efficiency (E), and safety (S) scores were compared to a priori-defined (≥6) and data-driven thresholds using binomial regression. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), PPV and NPV, using DIGEST D, E, S ≥ 1 (any impairment) and ≥ 2 (moderate-severe) as reference standards. RESULTS: Among 264 patients (mean age 62; 87 % male; 47 % nasopharyngeal cancer; 55 % post-RT), -Swallow ≥ 6 was associated with D ≥ 1 and D ≥ 2 (RRs = 1.8-2.6, p &lt; 0.05), showing high SP (92-95 %) but low SN (23-30 %). -Choke ≥ 6 demonstrated stronger associations for D ≥ 2 (RR = 3.5, p &lt; 0.05), and similar SN/SP tradeoffs. Data-driven thresholds improved accuracy: for D ≥ 1, a combined threshold (-Swallow or -Choke) ≥ 2 yielded SN 77 %, SP 64 %; for D ≥ 2, -Choke ≥ 1 showed SN 85 %, SP 69 %, while -Choke ≥ 2 increased SP to 84 %. For aspiration risk (S ≥ 2), -Choke ≥ 1 had SN 88 %, SP 66 %; -Choke ≥ 2 improved SP to 83 %. CONCLUSION: MDASI-Swallow and -Choke correlate with imaging-based dysphagia. While ≥ 6 may flag moderate-severe impairment, lower thresholds (≥1-2) offer better sensitivity, supporting early detection. Combined thresholds may enhance screening and guide survivorship care.</description>

This study aims to explore association between occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM) in level II and preoperative clinical characteristics. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed unilateral cN1b PTC patients who underwent surgery (2000-2017), with clinical lateral neck metastasis limiting in level III and IV. The OLNM in level II was assessed with preoperative clinical characteristics using logistic regression model; its association with pathological nodes distribution was examined with restricted cubic spline; the prognosis value of level II OLNM was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. RESULTS: A total of 640 patients (mean [SD] age, 41[11.3] years; 440[68.8 %] female individuals; 307[48.0 %] with OLNM in level II) were analyzed. Primary tumor size (&gt;1.5 cm, OR, 1.625[1.174-2.252]; P = 0.003) and clinical positive lymph nodes (multiple, OR, 4.241 [2.283-8.506]; P &lt; 0.001) are associated with elevated risk of level II OLNM. A non-linear relationship was found between level II OLNM and metastatic lymph nodes number in levels III and IV. No significant difference in all-site recurrence-free survival (RFS) or regional RFS was found between patients with or without level II OLNM, even after adjusting other potential risk factors. CONCLUSION: The primary tumor size and metastatic burden in adjacent cervical compartments are associated with risk of level II OLNM, super-selective neck dissection could be considered in patients with small primary tumor cancer and low metastatic burden.</description>

This study evaluates survival outcomes and prognostic factors-particularly the impact of tumor stage (pT category), histologic grade, and resection margins-in a contemporary institutional series. METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 30 patients treated for histologically confirmed sinonasal ITAC at a single centre from July 2010 to July 2024. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment strategies (including surgical approach and perioperative therapies), and outcomes were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: The study cohort comprised predominantly male patients (86.7%), with a mean age of 66 years. Advanced disease (pT3 and pT4) occurred in 66.7% of patients. The median follow-up was 53 months. Five-year OS was 58.6%, DSS 75.3%, and DFS 65.3%. Early-stage tumors (pT1 and pT2) demonstrated superior outcomes, achieving 100% five-year OS and DSS compared to 41.7% OS and 62.9% DSS for advanced stages (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pathological T category remains a key prognostic determinant in sinonasal ITAC. Endoscopic resection, including transnasal craniectomy when necessary, coupled with risk-adapted radiotherapy, yields favorable survival outcomes even in advanced cases.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fermi M, Guarino P, Chiari F, Serafini E, Filippini DM, Ferrulli G, Basso M, Mattioli F, Caporale CD, Marchioni D, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09887-8'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09887-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41495506/'&gt;41495506&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to identify potential prognostic factors influencing disease control and survival outcomes in patients with neck metastases (NLM) and/or intraparotid metastases (PLM) arising from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck. A secondary aim was to compare patients with isolated NLM, isolated PLM, and concurrent NLM/PLM. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective multicenter study included 68 patients with nodal metastatic cSCC treated at the Head and Neck Units of Bologna, Modena, and Pescara (2014-2024). Clinical, pathological, and treatment variables were analyzed for associations with survival using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models (IBM SPSS). RESULTS: The cohort included 30 patients with isolated NLM (44%), 14 with isolated PLM (21%), and 24 with both NLM and PLM (35%). At 5 years, DFS was 33.8%, DSS 70.6%, and OS 69.1%. DFS was reduced by extranodal extension (ENE) in PLM (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.65-9.48, p = .002). DSS was negatively influenced by perineural invasion (HR 4.53, 95% CI 1.02-34.44, p= 0.016), NLM ENE (HR 5.60, 95% CI 1.72-18.19, p = 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 8.90, 95% CI 2.51-18.90, p &lt; 0.001). OS was independently worsened by PNI (HR 6.16, 95% CI 1.20-31.39, p = 0.029), NLM ENE (HR 5.18, 95% CI 1.67-16.03, p= 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 7.03, 95% CI 2.24-22.07, p &lt; 0.001). Female sex (36% in isolated PLM vs 3% in isolated NLM, p = .004) and immunosuppression (67% in patients with both NLM and PLM, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with nodal dissemination pattern, but not with survival. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic relevance of PNI, ENE, advanced nodal stage, and lack of adjuvant RT in nodal metastatic cSCC. Immunosuppression and female sex appear more related to higher nodal dissemination patterns than to survival.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yu J, Zhang Y, Chen Z, Yang X, Bai L, Kuang L, Li F, Bi X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0339329'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0339329&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41493936/'&gt;41493936&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AIMS: Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common concern among cancer survivors; however, its prevalence and determinants in patients with oral and maxillofacial cancers have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to assess the severity of FCR and explore the relationships among resilience, quality of life (QoL), and FCR in preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals in China from March to July 2024. The study collected demographic and clinical data, the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), and the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 281 preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. The mean FCRI-SF score was 17.38 (SD = 4.73), with 85.1% of the participants exhibiting high FCR. Resilience, as measured by CD-RISC-10, had a mean score of 23.33 (SD = 3.85), whereas QoL, measured by the UW-QOL, had an average of 58.36 (SD = 8.61). Correlation analysis revealed significant associations among age, sex, first treatment, resilience, QoL, and FCR. Multiple linear regression revealed that QoL and sex were significant predictors of FCR, explaining 40.1% of the variance (P &lt; 0.001). Higher QoL was associated with lower FCR, and males reported lower levels of FCR than females did. DISCUSSION: Preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients experience elevated levels of FCR, which are influenced by various socio-demographic and clinical factors. These findings highlight the need for healthcare providers to develop targeted interventions and comprehensive support systems to address FCR effectively in this high-risk group.</description>

Interventional radiotherapy (IRT, brachytherapy) may provide a function-preserving alternative. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 12 patients with primary oral vestibule SCC treated between February 2022 and March 2025. Eleven underwent high-dose-rate IRT (HDR-IRT) with curative intent after multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation. Clinical outcomes, toxicity, and functional preservation were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients treated with HDR-IRT, ten achieved a complete response. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, nine were alive and disease-free. Two-year disease-specific survival and overall survival were 86% and 78%, respectively. Acute toxicity was limited to grade II mucositis, and long-term sequelae were minimal, with only mild skin dyschromia. No patient developed trismus or Stensen's duct dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive HDR-IRT appears to be a safe, effective, and organ-preserving therapeutic option for selected oral vestibule SCCs; however, further studies in larger cohorts are needed to validate our findings.</description>

P16, a surrogate marker for HPV, is also overexpressed in non-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (non-OPSCC), but its clinical impact remains unclear. This study evaluates the effect of p16 status in non-OPSCC. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of non-OPSCC patients from January 2017 to November 2023 was conducted. Demographics, clinical data, and p16 expression were analyzed. Survival and recurrence rates were compared using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier with log-rank testing. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients with non-OPSCC were included, most commonly in the oral cavity (55.3%). P16+ tumors were found in 21.8% of cases. Median follow-up length was similar between groups (p = 0.724). Tumor recurrence rates were similar (p = 0.377), and p16+ status did not significantly impact survival. CONCLUSIONS: P16 overexpression in non-OPSCC does not confer a significant survival advantage or reduced recurrence.</description>

Inaccuracies contribute to delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Tobacco-related changes in oral mucosa may compromise the accuracy of oral screening approaches, and, in emerging "smart" screening modalities, they may overshadow the influence of other predictive variables. The objective of this study was to evaluate the screening accuracy of an imaging- and risk factor-based OC screening platform in individuals practicing different types of tobacco usage. Methods: 318 subjects who had previously screened positive for increased OC risk were recruited and sorted into "tobacco smoker", "tobacco vaper", "tobacco chewer", "hookah user", "multiple tobacco usage", or "tobacco non-user" groups. Next, demographic information, risk factors, outcome of clinical examination, as well as AFI and pWLI were recorded using a prototype OC screening platform. The OC risk assessment outcome from the OC screening platform was compared to that from an oral medicine specialist. Results: The screening platform demonstrated high sensitivity in tobacco chewers and hookah users, and it also exceeded 90% in smokers, vapers, and multi-product users. In tobacco non-users, 80% screening sensitivity was recorded. Screening specificity was considerably better in tobacco non-users than in the tobacco-user groups, and low in tobacco chewers (33.3%), vapers (55.6%), and smokers (62.5%). Across all groups, agreement between the screening platform outcome and specialist evaluation exceeded 80%. Significant differences in probe accuracy were noted between tobacco non-users and users (p &lt; 0.05), except for tobacco vapers. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to consider the effects of type of tobacco use on the OC screening approach, and to integrate these variables into imaging-and risk-factor-based algorithms for OC screening.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Whittles J, Bharathan A, Hall S, Baumgartner J, Lopez J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18010154'&gt;10.3390/cancers18010154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41514662/'&gt;41514662&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: As pediatric head and neck cancer (pHNC) incidence increases, the development of new surgical oncology techniques to reduce morbidity are essential. Intraoperative navigation (iNav) represents the most translatable technology among both the model-comparative and integrative surgical navigation technologies to optimize surgical outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from 1970 to present (February 2025), investigating the use of iNav in cases of pHNC. Patient case details and authors' perception of iNav's utility were analyzed. A single-center retrospective case series review (September 2022 to September 2025) of the senior authors' experience employing iNav in pHNC cases was also performed. RESULTS: The scoping review identified twenty-seven cases of pHNC from sixteen studies that both utilized iNav and met the inclusion criteria. Many of the authors commented favorably on the utility of iNav technology, while concurrently agreeing upon its limitations. The case series review identified five cases of pHNC that met the inclusion criteria. This small case series revealed a 100% R0 resection rate with the use of iNav in four pHNC resections. The fifth case used iNav for biopsy site selection. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our scoping review as well as our institutional experience with this technology demonstrate its utility in guiding surgical approach, confirming depth of resection, and navigating marginal assessment. This study was limited by incidental and incomplete reporting of iNav's clinical application to pHNC; several extensive institutional reports had to be excluded due to insufficiently detailed data linkage. Our review builds upon the existing pediatric surgical literature, anchoring the evidentiary justification for the application of iNav to pediatric head and neck surgery.</description>

However, there is limited consensus on optimal sampling strategies, storage methods, and analytical approaches. This narrative review critically evaluates current strategies for sampling, preservation, DNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis in oral microbiome research related to oral cancer. We compared commonly used sampling methods, including saliva, oral rinse, swab, brush, and tissue biopsy, and reviewed preservation conditions, extraction kits, sequencing platforms, and analytical pipelines reported in recent oral microbiome studies. Sampling approaches affect microbial yield and site specificity. Saliva and oral rinse samples are convenient and noninvasive but may dilute lesion-specific microbial signals, whereas lesion-directed swabbing or brushing yields greater microbial biomass and biological relevance. Preservation media and storage temperature significantly influence microbial stability, and DNA extraction methods vary in their ability to remove host DNA. Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains the most common approach, shotgun metagenomics offers higher resolution and function insights but is still limited by clinical applicability. Differences in data pre- and post-processing models and normalization strategies further contribute to inconsistent microbial profiles. Given that oral mucosal sites differ markedly in structure and microenvironment, careful consideration is required to ensure that collected samples accurately represent the biological question being addressed. Methodological consistency across all workflow stages-from collection to analysis-is essential to generate reproducible, high-quality data and to enable reliable translation of oral microbiome research into clinical applications for cancer detection and risk assessment. Together, these insights provide a framework to guide future study design and support the development of clinically applicable microbiome-based biomarkers.</description>

While most cSCC cases can be treated with surgery, locally advanced, metastatic, and high-risk cSCC tumors are associated with a worse prognosis with higher rates of recurrence and require multimodality therapy. However, there is limited data on animal models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for the use of combinatory immunotherapy and radiation. Methods: In this study, spontaneously generated tumors using DMBA/TPA were treated over three weeks with either IgG control, anti-PD1 antibody monotherapy, 8 Gy of localized radiation, or a combination of anti-PD1 and 8 Gy of radiation followed by anti-PD1 therapy. Results: We found that while anti-PD1 therapy showed a trend toward slowed tumor growth compared to controls, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0775), with most mice showing continued tumor progression. Preliminary histological analysis suggested that anti-PD1 treatment increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and the addition of radiation further enhanced CD8+ responses but added greater variability. A pathologic review revealed that irradiated tumors were associated with fibroblastic spindle-like cell morphology. Conclusions: This animal model represents a potential preclinical model for studying CSCC with limited responses to immunotherapy to understand potential mechanisms of resistance.</description>

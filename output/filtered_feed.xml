Elucidation of the metabolic alterations linked to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) could uncover potential therapeutic strategies. Using proteomics and transcriptomic profiles, we identified wild-type IDH1 as a crucial metabolic enzyme upregulated in gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy (GP)-resistant NPC. IDH1 reprogrammed nucleotide metabolism in response to chemotherapy, linking DNA damage repair (DDR) to ferroptosis resistance via DHODH, thereby contributing to chemoresistance in NPC. Mechanistically, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a metabolite of IDH1, enhanced chromatin accessibility to promote DHODH transcription via α-KG-dependent dioxygenase ALKBH5-recruited HNRNPC. The DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234 markedly sensitized NPC cells to chemotherapy. Clinically, a prognostic model based on DDR and ferroptosis signatures effectively predicted disease relapse risk post-chemotherapy in NPC. This study links DDR to ferroptosis defense via the IDH1/α-KG/ALKBH5/DHODH axis, suggesting DHODH inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in tumors harboring wild-type IDH1.</description>

Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang WR, Liu GD, Ren DX, Liu XY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0341063'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0341063&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569987/'&gt;41569987&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: To compare the levels of allostatic load score (ALS) between thyroid cancer patients and patients with other types of cancer and explore whether ALS mediates the association between thyroid cancer and alterations in physiological function. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted a secondary analysis of 181 cancer patients using NHANES data from 2007 to 2020, including 91 individuals with thyroid cancer. Generalized linear regression, logistic regression, and sensitivity analysis were used to analyze the association between thyroid cancer and ALS in three different models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and feature importance analysis were utilized to assess the clinical predictive value of thyroid cancer. We also conducted a series of mediation analyses to examine the mediating role of ALS. RESULTS: The ALS in thyroid cancer patients was higher than that in other cancer types (P &lt; 0.05). Thyroid cancer was significantly associated with ALS even after adjusting for demographic variables (β = 0.770, 95%CI: 0.315-1.480; OR=2.255, 95%CI: 1.111-4.575). This association remained robust to missing data (all P &lt; 0.05) and was not confounded by drinking, diabetes, or thyroid disease (all P &gt; 0.05). Although thyroid cancer had limited predictive value on ALS, it exerted strong explanatory power. The mediation analysis conducted with imputed data and adjusted for confounding variables revealed that ALS fully mediated the effect of thyroid cancer on red cell distribution width (RDW) (IE: β = 0.103, P = 0.008; DE: β = 0.389, P = 0.056), with a mediation proportion of 20.93%. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that thyroid cancer condition were associated with elevated AL. AL mediated the relationship between thyroid cancer and RDW.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruiz-Torres DA, Roberts TJ, Du P, Mendel J, Neagele S, Bonora G, Zhang F, Efthymiou V, Merkin RD, Lin DT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569592/'&gt;41569592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Recurrence rates for locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are high. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

In the present study, we conducted cell proliferation assay and western blotting using cell lines derived from MM and the immunohistochemical analysis of pathological MM tissues to identify novel therapeutic targets. Herein, we report on the potential of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitors as molecular targeted therapies for MM. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study and laboratory analysis. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. METHODS: MTT assay and western blotting were performed on the HMV-II (RCB0777) and GAK (JCRB0180) cell lines, treated with the CDK4 inhibitors abemaciclib (LY2835219) and palbociclib (PD-0332991). This retrospective cohort study included patients with head and neck MM; immunohistochemistry was performed on clinical specimens. RESULTS: Abemaciclib and palbociclib showed concentration-dependent cytostatic effects on HMV-II and GAK cells at 72 hours in the MTT assay. In western blotting, they exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on phosphorylated RB1 in HMV-II and GAK cells at 24 hours. Of 23 patients, 18 (78.3%) had positive results on CDK4 immunostaining. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly associated with CDK4 status. CONCLUSION: Abemaciclib and palbociclib may suppress MM cell proliferation. The CDK4 signaling pathway is a potential target for molecular-targeted therapies in MM.</description>

Depth of invasion (DOI) affects staging, prognosis and treatment outcome. Pre-operative Contrast Enhanced Computed tomography (CECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are expensive and have limitations in assessing DOI.Buccal mucosa tumors not involving bone can be assessed for DOI by intraoral ultrasound (IOUS). RESEARCH QUESTION: Is IOUS reliable alternative to CECT in assessing DOI in buccal mucosa cancers? METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study compared assessment of DOI using IOUS and CECT in buccal mucosa cancers against gold standard of histopathology in 52 patients with OSCC staged T2 or T3. Sonologist, radiologist assessing CECT and pathologist were blinded against each other's findings. DOI by above methods was compared and correlation analysis between each imaging and histopathology was done. RESULTS: Out of 52 patients, DOI was same as histopathology in 37 patients (71.2%) by IOUS and in 14 patients (26.9%) by CECT. IOUS over-estimated DOI in 11 (21.1%) patients by 1-2 mm whereas CECT over-estimated DOI in 34 patients (65.4%) by 3-5 mm. DOI was under-estimated in 4 patients (7.1%) each by IOUS and CECT. Correlation coefficient between IOUS and histopathology was 0.929 and that between CECT and histopathology was 0.874 for DOI. CONCLUSION: IOUS is reliable, easily available tool without ionizing radiation in assessing DOI in OSCC not involving bone. RESULTS: are encouraging compared to CECT, but it is operator dependent. Multi-institutional, large studies may further validate this conclusion.</description>

However, the immunological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain undefined. Here, we perform longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of paired pre-/post-TPF HPSCC specimens, mapping immune cell dynamics underlying chemoresistance. Our study identifies ZNF683+ natural killer (NK) cells as a gatekeeper of chemotherapy efficacy through integrated single-cell transcriptomics, spatial multiplex immunohistochemistry and functional validation. Moreover, pretreatment baseline enrichment of ZNF683+ NK cells predicts TPF response, while GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells function as the predominant immunologic effector to successful TPF intervention. Mechanistically, bioinformatics and in vitro coculture data reveal that ZNF683+ NK cells directly interact with CD8+ T cells, and drive an MHC-I-dependent licensing of polyfunctional GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells. Collectively, this NK-CD8+ axis provides a potential predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in patients with HPSCC.</description>

To facilitate individualized risk assessment, this study aimed to develop and internally validate a novel prediction model. We retrospectively analyzed 3723 patients with OSCC from a single center (2012-2023), with 2792 eligible patients randomly allocated to a training (n = 1954) and a validation set (n = 838). A rigorous variable selection process was employed, where predictors significant in univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model that utilized a stepwise forward and backward elimination procedure to identify the final set of predictors. Six factors were ultimately incorporated into the nomogram: clinical T stage, clinical N stage, histological grade, perineural invasion, time from onset to treatment, and alcohol consumption. The model demonstrated good discrimination in both training (AUC = 0.780) and validation (AUC = 0.744), excellent calibration, and clinical utility. In conclusion, this internally validated nomogram accurately predicts CLNM risk and can aid in tailoring neck management, pending external validation.</description>

Though it has been associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis, increasing CIN above a maximally tolerated threshold leads to cell death because of loss of essential chromosomes. Because radiation causes CIN, we hypothesize that pre-existing CIN sensitizes tumor cells to radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We induced mitotic defects that lead to CIN in FaDu (head and neck cancer, HNC) and HeLa (cervical) cells by knocking down or overexpressing the mitotic checkpoint protein mitotic arrest deficient 1 (Mad1), which induces lagging chromosomes. Radiation sensitivity was tested with clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts in vivo. MTT assays were used to determine the sensitivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV-negative HNC cells to docetaxel, and mitotic defects were quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy. Docetaxel-induced mitotic errors and tumor growth delay were evaluated in vivo. Six-chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantify CIN in a cohort of patients with laryngeal cancer treated with definitive radiation. RESULTS: Here, we show in two tissue contexts using engineered isogenic cancer cell lines that higher rates of chromosome missegregation sensitize to ionizing radiation, which itself induces mitotic errors. Consistent with this result, higher rates of anaphase defects in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNC patient-derived xenograft tumors correlate with response to radiation. Moreover, laryngeal tumors with higher CIN before treatment tend to have an improved response to radiation therapy in the clinic. Furthermore, we show that docetaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug commonly used in combination with radiation, causes cell death and radiosensitizes cells by inducing abnormal multipolar spindles rather than causing mitotic arrest. CONCLUSIONS: These results mechanistically implicate CIN as an inducer of radiation response and provide evidence that increasing the rate of CIN is a rational method to enhance radiation sensitivity, which has significant implications for personalized therapy.</description>

The anterior commissure is a surgically challenging area due to limited accessibility, high incidence of postoperative stenosis and risk of recurrence [2] (Chone et al Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 133(9):882-887, 2). OBJECTIVE: To share our experience with a single-stage reconstruction technique for anterior commissure defects following TLM, using a buccal mucosal graft secured with sutures and tissue glue, and to present post-surgical outcomes. METHODS: A series of five cases performed at VPS Lakeshore Hospital, Kochi, over a 1.5-year period (January 2024-April 2025) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of anterior commissure of glottis following TLM were evaluated. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. TLM was performed using carbon dioxide laser, followed by reconstruction using a buccal mucosal graft fixed with polypropylene sutures and tissue glue. Outcomes were assessed using Voice Handicap Index (VHI) scores (Johnson et al Am J Speech-Language Pathol 6: 66-70, 3), video laryngoscopic evaluation of graft integrity, and rates of postoperative stenosis or adhesion. RESULTS: All patients remained free of disease at the end of the follow up period. VHI scores indicated acceptable postoperative voice quality. Post operative healing in patients who underwent transcutaneous suture fixation of grafts with tissue glue support demonstrated better and predictable outcomes in terms of stable graft positioning, good vocal cord approximation and minimal fibrosis. CONCLUSION: This novel, single-stage reconstruction technique allows good healing of anterior commissure defects by preventing stenosis. Functional outcomes measured by VHI are good. It offers a cost-effective alternative to staged procedures while ensuring optimal vocal outcomes.</description>

A key driver of this failure is the emergence of drug-tolerant persister (DTP) cells, which enter a reversible quiescent state to evade chemotherapy. Ferroptosis-an iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-driven form of cell death-has recently gained attention as a strategy to overcome such tolerance. This study investigated the role of ferroptosis suppressor protein-1 (FSP1) and its interplay with acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member-4 (ACSL4) in modulating ferroptosis sensitivity and cisplatin resistance in PTC. METHODS: Cisplatin-resistant PTC tissues and primary DTP cells from recurrent cases were examined alongside in-vitro DTP models (8505 C and K1). FSP1 and ferroptosis markers were profiled by qPCR, immunofluorescence, and RNA-seq. Functional relevance was tested through ACSL4 knockdown (shACSL4) and pharmacologic FSP1 inhibition (iFSP1), alone or combined with cisplatin. Ferroptosis and metabolic states were assessed using viability, GSH/GSSG, lipid ROS, and Seahorse XF assays. RESULTS: Resistant tumors and DTP cells exhibited marked FSP1 upregulation with concurrent ACSL4 suppression, forming an FSP1-high/ACSL4-low adaptive state dependent on FSP1. iFSP1 treatment alone triggered pronounced ferroptosis, lipid peroxide accumulation, mitochondrial depolarization, and metabolic collapse, sharply restoring cisplatin sensitivity (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, ACSL4 targeting conferred no additional benefit. CONCLUSION: FSP1 acts as a metabolic safeguard maintaining ferroptosis resistance and drug tolerance in PTC. Its inhibition disrupts mitochondrial integrity and reinstates ferroptotic vulnerability, positioning FSP1 as a promising therapeutic target to eliminate drug-tolerant persister cells and reverse cisplatin resistance.</description>

This study evaluated trends in outpatient PC consultation over 7 years at a comprehensive cancer center and identified predictors of timely referral to PC. METHODS: We randomly selected 700 patients seen at our outpatient supportive care center (100 per year, 2017-2023). Demographics, cancer diagnosis, symptom burden, date of outpatient PC consultation, and survival status were retrieved from their electronic medical records. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), defined as time from outpatient PC consultation to death or last follow-up. Timely referral to PC was defined as occurring ≥6 months before death or last follow-up from outpatient PC consultation. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models identified predictors associated with timely referral. RESULTS: Among 700 patients (median age 62 years, 54% female, 92% with advanced cancer), the median OS increased from 9.3 months in 2017 to 31.7 months in 2021 (P = .0001). The median follow-up for living individuals at the data cutoff was 19.1 months. The median number of PC visits increased from 3 to 7 between 2017 and 2023. Four hundred forty-nine (72%) patients received timely referral. In multivariable analysis, timely referral was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; P = .014), head and neck cancer (OR, 4.64; P &lt; .001), hematologic malignancies (OR, 3.31; P = .013), lower pain (OR, 0.9; P = .008), lower anorexia (OR, 0.88; P = .001), year of consultation (OR, 1.12; P = .038), and better performance status (OR, 0.70; P = .006). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a gradual and consistent shift toward earlier PC referral at a comprehensive cancer center, demonstrating that timely referral to PC with a follow-up of 30+ months is possible.</description>

We characterized hospital type, geographic distribution, and market concentration of TORS. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study of inpatient Medicare claims from 2017 to 2023, identifying OPSCC with ICD-10-CM codes and TORS with ICD-10-PCS codes including a robotic-assistance qualifier. Claims were linked to inpatient prospective payment system files for hospital teaching status, disproportionate share hospital (DSH) percentage, urbanicity, and geographic labor market area (GLMA). We mapped county-level procedure counts, calculated GLMA-level Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), and used negative binomial regression to evaluate associations of hospital factors with TORS volume and inpatient length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: We identified 2499 unique TORS procedures at 161 hospitals; 86.2% occurred at teaching hospitals, and annual volume rose 31% from 2017 to 2023. TORS use was geographically diffuse but locally concentrated: among 102 GLMAs with any TORS, 64.7% had HHI = 10 000 and 28.4% had HHI 5000-9999. Six GLMAs with &gt; 100 procedures accounted for 33.6% of all cases and were predominantly teaching centers. Higher teaching intensity was associated with greater TORS use (incidence rate ratio [IRR]: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.63-2.45). LOS was longer in urban and rural hospitals versus metropolitan centers and shorter in high-volume GLMAs (IRR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.87). CONCLUSION: Among Medicare beneficiaries with OPSCC, TORS is concentrated in teaching hospitals and a few high-volume markets, with shorter LOS in high-volume regions, highlighting trade-offs between centralization and access.</description>

We aimed to investigate aggressive inpatient care and palliative care (PC) at the EoL for hospitalized patients with distant metastases. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Patients with metastatic head and neck cancer and terminal hospitalization were identified in the National Inpatient Sample database between 2016 and 2020. METHODS: We examined the level of aggressive inpatient care (intensive care unit (ICU) level of care, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery) and PC at the EOL. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine their associations with selected patient and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 43 310 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-five percent of patients received one or more forms of aggressive EOL interventions, and 61.76% received PC. Among the 15 095 receiving aggressive intervention, 76.9% received ICU level of care, 12.18% received chemotherapy, 19.2% surgery, and 8.04% radiotherapy during their terminal hospitalization. In multivariable analyses, younger age, lower PC use, larger hospitals, urban teaching hospitals, and higher risk of mortality were associated with a greater likelihood of aggressive care. PC was associated with lower hospital costs (-$20,115; [-$28,284, -$11,946]) and aggressive care was associated with higher terminal hospitalization costs ($100,309; [$91,373, $109,245]). CONCLUSION: Receiving PC at the EoL was associated with less aggressive interventions and costly hospitalization. Further research should examine these associations using prospective designs and evaluate whether increased PC referral and early uptake might help diminish poor quality of care and costly hospitalizations.</description>

This study reports the long-term follow-up of de-escalation in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, providing critical data for future studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced HPV-OPC treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by reduced-dose chemoradiation (rdCRT). We hypothesized that de-escalated radiation therapy after IC would be non-inferior to standard-dose CRT (sdCRT). DESIGN: Two sequential clinical trials; Quarterback (QB) 1: phase III randomized control trial, QB 2: phase II non-randomized trial; patient accrual conducted between December 2012 and February 2022; final data cutoff April 2025. Median follow-up (IQR): 88.5 (64.6-118.2) months. SETTING: Single-institution academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients with HPV-OPC were screened. 47 patients received rdCRT after IC and were included in the primary analysis. Key eligibility: smoking history ≤20 pack-years, no active smoking, no distant metastases, molecularly confirmed HPV status. INTERVENTIONS: Three cycles of induction TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) followed by rdCRT (5600 cGy) with weekly carboplatin in clinical responders; non-responders in both QB trials and responders in the control arm of QB1 received sdCRT (7000 cGy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoints: 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary: overall survival (OS). Tertiary: disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Among 47 patients treated with rdCRT after IC, the 3-year and 5-year LRRFS were 89.3% and 86.6%. PFS was 87.2% and 84.6% at 3 and 5 years. OS was 91.5% and 89.1% at 3 and 5 years. Six patients (13%) experienced locoregional failure, and two (4%) developed distant metastases. 7/8 treatment failures (87.5%) occurred in patients with extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rdCRT following IC yields durable disease control in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, with outcomes comparable to historical benchmarks. Extended follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of this de-escalation strategy, even in patients with aggressive disease characteristics, but also underscores the need for careful patient selection, particularly in those with extracapsular extension.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lin YC, Kang D, Cao B, Hume E, Tabriz AA, Suneja G, Coghill AE, Jim H, Turner K, Islam JY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of geriatric oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102855'&gt;10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102855&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41558110/'&gt;41558110&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: People with HIV (PWH) are more likely to die due to cancer compared to people without HIV. Disparities in cancer care, including access to palliative care, for PWH contribute to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and survival. However, limited research exists examining patient-reported HRQoL among PWH with cancer. We examined HRQoL among patients diagnosed with non-AIDS defining cancers with and without HIV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the 2007-2017 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linkage data to assess HRQoL among patients (ages ≥18) diagnosed with breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, and prostate cancers. HRQoL outcomes included the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores and the eight scale scores of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), and the VR-6D health utility score. Higher HRQoL scores indicate better health status. Adjusting for patient characteristics, we computed mean HRQoL scores using multivariable linear regression models and the predictive margins method. The minimally important difference (MID) in HRQoL scores between patients with and without HIV by cancer types was assessed. RESULTS: The sample (N = 43,973) included 310 (0.7%) patients with HIV and had an average age at cancer diagnosis of 70.8 years. PWH reported lower scores in at least one HRQoL outcome compared to patients without HIV for all cancers examined. Differences in HRQoL for PWH compared to patients without HIV exceeded the MID for cancers of the breast (PCS: -2.7; MCS: -9.1; VR-6D: -0.08), colorectum (PCS: -2.3; MCS: -6.2; VR-6D: -0.06), gastrointestinal tract (MCS: -5.9; VR-6D: -0.04), head and neck (PCS: -4.1; MCS: -7.5; VR-6D: -0.07), lungs (PCS: -2.5; MCS: -6.3; VR-6D: -0.06), lymphatic system (PCS: -2.3; MCS: -2.6; VR-6D: -0.04), and prostate (MCS: -8.0; VR-6D: -0.07). DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrated that PWH across all cancers examined reported substantially lower mental and/or physical HRQoL compared to patients without HIV. Future work can explore strategies for symptom monitoring and management among PWH.</description>

This study aims to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of FSA for identification of HPV-associated SCCUP. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with biopsy-proven p16-positive SCCUP who underwent diagnostic operation at two tertiary care institutions was performed. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of diagnostic FSA were assessed. RESULTS: 77 patients were included in analysis. 66 patients underwent definitive TORS (diagnostic TORS operation with subsequent neck dissection after identification of the occult primary tumor), 7 patients underwent diagnostic TORS (TORS to identify occult primary tumor, no neck dissection), and 4 patients underwent direct laryngoscopy and biopsy only. Primary tumors were identified in 63 patients (82%) with a mean tumor size of 1.1 cm. There was no significant difference in size between patients whose tumor was identified on FSA (mean 1.1 cm) and on permanent only (mean 0.9 cm) (p = 0.26). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of FSA for SCCUP was 86%, 100%, 100%, and 86%, respectively. Diagnostic frozen specimens included 52 direct laryngoscopy biopsies and 69 TORS excisions. In the biopsies, sensitivity was 100% and NPV was 100%, whereas in the TORS-excised specimens, sensitivity was 77% and NPV was 77%. CONCLUSIONS: In this case series of 77 patients with SCCUP, the sensitivity and NPV of FSA for identification of the primary tumor was over 85%. FSA is valuable during diagnostic operation for SCCUP.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the association between various levels of lead exposure in drinking water and incidence rates of head and neck cancers (HNC) in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. SETTING: County-level data from 608 US counties included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: County-level HNC incidence rates and sociodemographic variables were obtained from SEER. Drinking water lead concentrations were sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW). Tobacco and alcohol use data were retrieved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flexible semi-parametric regression models were used to assess the association between lead exposure and HNC incidence, adjusting for known confounders. Multiple comparisons were addressed using Holm's method, and sensitivity analyses were performed using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. RESULTS: Higher lead concentrations were significantly associated with increased incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancers (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P &lt; .01), gum and mouth cancers (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P = .02), and esophageal neoplasms (IRR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, P = .02). These associations remained significant after multiple testing correction and were consistent across OLS models. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that even low-level lead exposure below EPA limits in drinking water is associated with increased incidence of specific HNC subsites. These findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into environmental determinants of HNC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.</description>

However, complications of oncologic temporal bone surgery have not been systematically categorized. We aim to detail the postoperative outcomes of lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) and mastoidectomy for otologic oncology patients, and secondarily, to identify preoperative risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Patients with temporal bone or parotid gland malignancies treated with LTBR or mastoidectomy at our institution. Demographic, clinical, and 30-day postoperative data was extracted from a head and neck-specific (HNS) NSQIP database. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four patients underwent LTBR (n = 121) or mastoidectomy (n = 53). Reconstruction was performed in 98%, with 94% being free flaps. Half experienced at least one postoperative occurrence (n = 59/121, LTBR; n = 27/53 mastoidectomy). The most common was anemia requiring blood transfusion (n = 47/174), with nearly double the incidence in LTBR versus mastoidectomy (32.2% vs 15.1%, P = .019). LTBR patients had longer length of stay (mean 7.6 vs 5.5 days), while mastoidectomy had higher rates of facial nerve injury (5.7% vs 1.7%, P &gt; .05). On multivariable analysis, patients with increased age (per decade) (P = .012), higher stage tumors (T3/T4) (P = .048) and lengthy operative time (&gt;13 hours) (P = .015) had significantly increased risk of developing an HNS-NSQIP occurrence. CONCLUSION: LTBR and mastoidectomy, alongside their reconstruction, are associated with relatively high rates for anemia requiring blood transfusion, new-onset facial paralysis, and extended length of stay. When performing risk assessment and mitigation, age, tumor stage, and operative time should be considered.</description>

However, mETE remains classified as an intermediate-risk feature for recurrence in thyroid cancer. The prognostic significance of mETE and its association with recurrence risk remain subjects of ongoing debate. METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1870 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) with central lymph node dissection (CLND) between 2015 and 2020. Cox proportional hazards regression models and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the association of mETE with structural recurrence. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.9 months, 124 patients (6.6%) experienced structural recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with mETE than in those without (11.0% vs. 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that mETE was an independent risk factor, particularly in patients with bilateral tumors (HR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.8-4.95) and those without Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.53-3.63). A significant interaction between tumor bilaterality and mETE was observed (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PTC, mETE is a significant prognostic factor of structural recurrence and is associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS). Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that mETE elevates recurrence risk to near the ATA intermediate-high threshold (17.6%) in bilateral PTC, regardless of tumor size. This synergy of mETE and bilaterality supports upgrading risk stratification and intensifying surveillance for this subset.</description>

Although imaging techniques have advanced, occult metastases are present in approximately 20-30% of patients with early-stage oral cancer and clinically negative necks. OBJECTIVE: This review examines current evidence on optimal strategies for managing the N0 neck in oral cancer patients. METHODS: We discuss diagnostic modalities for detecting occult metastases, including clinical examination, conventional imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), functional imaging (positron emission tomography), and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The review evaluates the main management approaches---elective neck dissection, watchful waiting, and sentinel lymph node biopsy---analyzing current evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. RESULTS: We examine patient and tumor factors that influence decision-making, including tumor thickness, location, differentiation, and pattern of invasion. Special considerations for specific subsites and clinical scenarios are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we explore emerging technologies and future directions in the management of the N0 neck, including molecular biomarkers, liquid biopsy techniques, and personalized approaches to treatment. This review provides evidence-based recommendations to support clinical decision-making for managing patients with oral cancer and clinically negative necks.</description>

METHODS: Sex, age, staging, year, and Federative Unit of diagnosis were evaluated for all cases registered under the ICD-C02 code in a public nationwide database. Statistics encompassed the Dickey-Fuller and Mann-Kendall tests, Kendall's Tau coefficient, and Sen's Slope Estimator. RESULTS: The registry of OTSCC increased from 2013 to 2023, with a stronger and more consistent trend in young adults. OTSCC showed a stronger, more consistent, and higher rate of increase in young females than in young males. OTSCC was diagnosed at advanced stages in both age groups. OTSCC increasing trends were pronounced in the North region. CONCLUSION: This study presented an overview of the temporal trends of OTSCC in Brazil, evidencing an increase among young women.</description>

Yet most computational tools highlight common cell types and overlook rare populations that can drive disease. Here we show GARDEN, a computational framework that identifies and characterizes these pathogenic cells or regions in spatial omics by embedding graph-based dynamic attention into a spatially-aware graph fusion contrastive model. GARDEN works consistently across tissues, species and resolution scales, and aligns consecutive sections to reconstruct 3D anatomy. In an Alzheimer's disease model, GARDEN localizes C1qa/C1qb-marked microglia in amyloid-β regions and reveals key immune pathways. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma it identifies tiny tertiary lymphoid structures, and in breast cancer it uncovers inflammatory M1-like macrophages near ductal carcinoma in situ and links them to pro-metastatic signaling. An interpretation module pinpoints key immune signatures, and GARDEN extends to spatial chromatin accessibility, providing insight into epigenetic regulation and informing diagnostics and therapeutic targeting.</description>

However, evidence remains limited regarding whether, and to what extent, pre-treatment nutritional parameters contribute to local recurrence and metastasis. So, the aim was to estimate the association between pre-treatment nutritional parameters and these outcomes such as mortality, local recurrence, and metastasis over a five-year follow-up in patients with HNC, and to assess the prognostic validity of the nutritional parameters. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 84 HNC patients treated at a reference outpatient clinic, followed for up to five years after treatment initiation. Nutritional status was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), and the ESPEN criteria, as well as the Weight Loss Grading System (WLGS), and the presence of cachexia. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between pre-treatment nutritional parameters and clinical outcomes. The sensitivity and specificity of these parameters were also estimated to determine their predictive potential. RESULTS: High rates of mortality (76.2%), local recurrence (31.1%), and metastasis (38.1%) were observed. At the beginning of the study, most patients were at nutritional risk (34.5% PG-SGA score ≥ 10 to &lt; 16, and 36.9% PG-SGA score ≥ 16), 27.4 to 67.9% were malnourished depending on the diagnostic criteria, and 47.6% presented with cachexia. All nutritional parameters, except WLGS and ESPEN criteria, were associated with higher mortality and shorter survival. The PG-SGA score was the only parameter associated with local recurrence, while cachexia, nutritional risk, and malnutrition according to PG-SGA were associated with metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment nutritional risk, malnutrition (by GLIM and PG-SGA), and cachexia were associated with mortality, which was also associated with metastasis. Notably, nutritional risk (PG-SGA score &gt; 16) was the only parameter associated with all three outcomes. From a clinical perspective, we suggest that combining PG-SGA and cachexia assessment may enhance prediction of mortality and metastasis in HNC patients, respectively.</description>

This study aimed to define a histology-driven molecular profiling (MP) algorithm for SGCs to optimize testing strategies and support therapeutic decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all SGC patients who underwent MP (2016-2023) for gene rearrangements and pathogenic/likely pathogenic DNA variants (P-LPV). We considered adenoid cystic carcinomas (AdCCs) versus non-AdCCs, the latter as low aggression (LA) or high aggression (HA). MP included DNA/RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) ± fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and IHC for androgen receptor (AR) status. FISH, NGS and/or IHC were used for neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) detection. RESULTS: Among a total of 253 SGCs, AdCCs (132/253, 52%) had MYB/MYBL1 fusions in 47% of cases, all lacking P-LPV. Among HA non-AdCCs (84/253, 33%), P-LPV were found in 55% of cases, including TP53 (34%), PIK3CA (18%), HRAS (14%) and PTEN (5%), in the absence of gene fusions. We found P-LPV in 50% of LA non-AdCCs (37/253, 15%), with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in one secretory carcinoma. HER2 analysis identified HER2 positivity in 23% of cases (all HA non-AdCC), with 36% HER2-low and 41% HER2-negative. We found less P-LPV in HER2-positive (17.6%) versus HER2-low (67%) or HER2-negative (64%), regardless of AR status. MP-guided therapy was delivered in 4% of cases. Based on our results, we propose a stepwise, histology-driven MP algorithm for SGCs. In AdCCs, we recommend initial FISH for MYB/MYBL1 fusions: fusion-positive cases typically lack other P-LPV, sparing further MP. In fusion-negative cases, DNA NGS can be considered. In HA non-AdCCs, HER2 and AR should be tested upfront, proceeding with DNA NGS in HER2-low/negative tumors. In LA non-AdCCs, we recommend ETV6-NTRK3 FISH followed by DNA/RNA NGS in fusion-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the clinical implementation of a tailored, histology-driven MP algorithm, potentially optimizing the genomic testing resources in SGCs.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hijioka H, Tabata H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0340884'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0340884&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41544048/'&gt;41544048&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preoperative depth of invasion (DOI) is a critical predictor of cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). Ultrasonography (US) offers high accuracy for shallow tumors, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior visualization of deeper structures. However, each modality has limitations. This retrospective, exploratory study aimed to investigate a combined strategy leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities to improve preoperative CLNM prediction. The study included 46 patients with TSCC who underwent radical surgery between September 2014 and August 2019. Correlations between US-derived DOI (usDOI), MRI-derived DOI (mrDOI), and pathological DOI (pDOI) were assessed using Pearson's product-moment correlation. Agreement was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis. A grid search approach identified the optimal usDOI threshold for switching to mrDOI, and predictive performance for CLNM was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with the area under the curve (AUC). Both usDOI and mrDOI showed strong correlations with pDOI (r = 0.956 and r = 0.958, respectively). However, usDOI demonstrated smaller measurement bias (mean difference: 0.88 mm) compared to mrDOI (2.43 mm). Bland-Altman plots revealed that usDOI tended to underestimate pDOI when the mean DOI exceeded 10 mm. Grid search analysis determined an optimal threshold of 7 mm for switching from US to MRI measurements. The combined DOI strategy -using usDOI for DOI ≤ 7 mm and mrDOI for DOI &gt; 7 mm- yielded a numerically higher AUC (0.694) compared to either modality alone (usDOI: AUC = 0.682; mrDOI: AUC = 0.673). This study demonstrates the potential value of a conditional imaging strategy that applies US for shallow lesions and MRI for deeper ones. By capitalizing on the strengths of each modality, this approach offers a logical framework for improving the accuracy of preoperative CLNM prediction in TSCC. Larger, prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings.</description>

Therefore, we compared real-world survival and molecular/transcriptional signatures in patients with BRAF-mut and BRAF-wildtype (wt) PTC. METHODS: Thyroid tumor samples underwent DNA/RNA next-gen sequencing and immunohistochemistry at Caris Life Sciences. Tumor microenvironment (TME) cell fractions were estimated by RNA deconvolution using QuanTIseq. Insurance claims data was used to infer real-world overall survival (OS) and time on treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1348 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were identified; 81.8% were classified as PTC, of which 68.4% harbored a BRAF-V600E mutation. TERT promoter mutations were the most common mutation in PTC (72%), and more prevalent in BRAF-mut versus (vs) BRAF-wt. Mutations in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS, as well as RET, BRAF, and ETV6 gene fusions, were predominantly found in BRAF-wt PTC. BRAF-mut PTC were more often PD-L1+ (33% vs. 18%, p&lt;0.001) and had significantly higher IFNγ scores. OS was not significantly different between patients with BRAF-mut vs wt PTC. Systemic treatment (BRAF/MEKi, TKI or IO) was not associated with significant differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC, although there was a trend for longer OS in those treated with TKI compared to BRAF/MEKi or IO. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF-mut PTC is associated with a pro-inflammatory TME milieu compared to BRAF-wt PTC. However, in this limited data set, treatment choice was not associated with differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive liquid biopsy tool to stratify patient risk preoperatively. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study evaluating preoperative CTC levels in 210 patients diagnosed with PTC. A dual-threshold model was developed to analyze the diagnostic performance of CTC counts. The study particularly focused on the Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) subgroup (n=100) to address clinical uncertainty regarding active surveillance versus definitive therapy. Patients were monitored over a median follow-up period of 44 months to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and long-term prognostic outcomes. RESULTS: The dual-threshold model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff of ≥ 2 CTCs effectively identified high-risk patients with 93.2% specificity and 88.2% positive predictive value (PPV). In the PTMC cohort, a CTC count &lt; 2 reliably identified low-risk patients suitable for active surveillance (NPV=94.0%), while a count ≥ 2 pinpointed those with high-risk features warranting surgery (Specificity=96.4%, PPV=80.0%). Prognostic analysis revealed that CTC-negative patients had improved PFS. This was most significant in the PTMC subgroup, where the CTC-negative cohort remained recurrence-free and showed significantly longer PFS compared to CTC-positive cases (HR=0.035, 95% CI: 0.002-0.726; P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CTC detection enables precise risk stratification for PTC patients. This liquid biopsy approach allows clinicians to personalize therapy-confidently selecting conservative management for low-risk individuals and recommending aggressive treatment for high-risk patients-thereby optimizing clinical decision-making and long-term outcomes.</description>

This study explored the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for the treatment of rNPC. METHODS: This single-arm, Phase 2 trial included patients with rNPC who met the inclusion criteria as confirmed by pathology or imaging. The patients received toripalimab combined with CCRT. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) of the patients. Secondary end points included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile. RESULTS: Between April 2020 and September 2023, 40 patients with rNPC were recruited. The best response of ORR after radiotherapy was 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72.0-95.0), with a DCR of 100%. The median PFS for rNPC was 18.1 months (95% CI, 15.2-28.8). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year PFS rates were 68.2%, 41.3%, and 15.5%, respectively. The median OS for rNPC was 28.3 months (95% CI, 18.6-Not Available [NA]). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates were 69.7%, 53.9%, 44.8%. The most common acute toxicities were hematological toxicities, including lymphopenia (100%) and anemia (92.5%), whereas the most common late toxicities were dry mouth (60.0%) and nasopharyngeal wall necrosis (40.0%). Fatal epistaxis was the cause of death in 22.5% of patients. CONCLUSION: Toripalimab plus CCRT demonstrates antitumor efficacy in rNPC. The observed 22.5% rate of fatal epistaxis indicates that its potential benefits must be carefully weighed against this serious treatment-related risk.</description>

METHODS: A prospective population-based screening study was conducted in Southern China from October 2014 to November 2018 among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals aged 30-69 years. EBV-seropositive participants underwent both endoscopy and MRI. Suspicious findings from either modality triggered a second endoscopy with biopsy. Followup for cancer diagnoses was completed via multiple methods in October 2023. Primary end points included the 5-year NPC detection rate (overall and by stage) and the false-negative rate. Secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and referral rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 814 individuals (455 females; 56%) with a median age of 53 years (interquartile range, 46-60 years). Thirty-two NPC cases were detected (30 via MRI; 21 via endoscopy) over 5 years. MRI showed a significantly higher overall NPC detection rate (36.9 [95% CI, 25.9-52.1] vs. 25.8 [95% CI, 16.9-39.1] per 1000; p = .007) and early-stage tumor detection (20.9 [95% CI, 13.1-27.1] vs. 12.3 [95% CI, 6.7-22.5] per 1000; p = .020) than endoscopy. MRI also demonstrated a lower false-negative rate (3.0 [95% CI, 0.8-11.0] vs. 14.9 [95% CI, 8.4-26.5] per 1000; p = .024) and higher sensitivity (93.8% vs. 65.6%; p = .007) but lower specificity (84.0% vs. 92.8%; p &lt; .001) and PPV (19.6% vs. 27.6%; p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Single MRI demonstrated superior NPC detection versus endoscopy, particularly for early-stage tumors, in high-risk populations during a 5-year period, which suggests the potential for extending the rescreening interval to 5 years for MRI-negative individuals.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 8510 laryngoscopic images from 743 patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. A dual-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture was constructed, integrating multi-scale feature analysis with cross-attention fusion mechanisms. The model was rigorously evaluated through internal-external validation and a prospective reader study involving 12 endoscopists of varying expertise. RESULTS: The AI system demonstrated superior performance in three-tier classification, achieving F1-scores of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.869-0.896) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.844-0.878) for high-risk lesion identification in internal and external validation, respectively. AI assistance significantly improved junior endoscopists' sensitivity from 67.1% to 81.4% (P &lt; 0.001), effectively narrowing diagnostic performance disparities with senior experts. The system maintained robust generalizability across institutions, with 90.5% accuracy under heterogeneous imaging protocols. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI framework provides a clinically effective solution for reliable VCL risk stratification and reduces diagnostic variability between clinicians. Validated across multiple centers, this dual-scale ViT approach establishes a novel paradigm for laryngoscopic diagnosis and holds significant potential to standardize diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings.</description>

We evaluated whether neoadjuvant therapy could enable transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in a subset of patients with advanced BOT-SCC. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, nine consecutive patients with stage ≥T4N2bM0 BOT-SCC received three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy based on pembrolizumab, followed by TORS with concurrent neck dissection. Radiologic response and tumor shrinkage were assessed after neoadjuvant therapy. Perioperative outcomes, correlations between radiologic shrinkage and operative metrics, postoperative complications (Clavien -Dindo), and 3-month functional outcomes (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI], Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS], and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain [GRBAS]) were recorded. Follow-up was conducted for oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Post-neoadjuvant radiologic evaluation demonstrated clinically meaningful downstaging, with partial response in 6/9 patients (66.7%) and stable disease in 3/9 patients (33.3%). Mean tumor reduction was 35.6% ± 11.2% (median, 36%; interquartile range [IQR], 28 -44). All patients achieved R0 resection. Mean operative time was 193.3 ± 46.9 min (median, 180; IQR, 165 -240), and mean intraoperative blood loss was 78.3 ± 25.4 mL (median, 70; IQR, 60 -100). Tumor shrinkage was inversely correlated with operative time (r = -0.962; 95% CI: -0.992 to -0.825; p &lt; 0.001) and blood loss (r = -0.851; 95% CI: -0.968 to -0.430; p = 0.004), while operative time was positively correlated with blood loss (r = 0.864; 95% CI: 0.469 to 0.971; p = 0.003). No Clavien -Dindo grade ≥III complications or postoperative hemorrhage occurred. At 3 months, functional outcomes were favorable (mean MDADI 75.6 ± 10.2; FOIS ≥6 in 55.6%; median GRBAS 1.1). Over a median follow-up of 12 months, no local recurrences or distant metastases were documented. DISCUSSION: Neoadjuvant therapy may render a subset of patients with advanced BOT-SCC eligible for TORS, enabling oncologically radical resection with low perioperative morbidity and promising early functional recovery. Prospective studies are warranted to validate patient selection criteria and to develop biomarker-guided de-intensification strategies.</description>

We assessed global, regional, and national trends in NPC burden from 1990 to 2021 and projected estimates to 2050. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study for 204 countries and territories across 21 regions. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate were estimated, and temporal trends were assessed using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) by socio-demographic index (SDI), sex, and age group. Future burden from 2022 to 2050 was projected using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: In 2021, there were 118,878 incident cases, 75,359 deaths, and 2,490,191 DALYs due to NPC globally. The global ASIR was 1.38 per 100,000 population (EAPC -1.06), the ASDR was 0.87 (EAPC -2.17), and the age-standardized DALYs rate was 28.91 (EAPC -2.29). Incidence rate peaked at ages 65-69 years (4.23 per 100,000 population), with consistently higher rates in males than in females. East Asia had the highest regional ASIR, and Japan bore the highest age-specific disease burden. Projections indicate continued declines in apparent ASDR and DALYs rates globally to 2050, but rising ASIR in males, particularly in East Asia and high-middle SDI regions. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past three decades, global mortality and disability burden from NPC have decreased, whereas incidence has increased in selected populations. The projected rise in ASIR among males in high-risk regions highlights the need for targeted interventions, equitable resource allocation, and sustained surveillance to mitigate future burden.</description>

Preoperative differentiation among follicular thyroid adenoma (FA), follicular tumor of uncertain malignant potential (FT-UMP), and FTC remains challenging using conventional ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration. This study aims to develop a machine learning model utilizing ultrasound radiomic features to improve risk stratification of follicular thyroid tumors. METHODS: A total of 277 patients with histopathologically confirmed follicular tumors (163 FA, 63 FT-UMP, 51 FTC) were included. Clinical and ultrasound features, along with radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral regions, were extracted from preoperative ultrasound images. Three machine learning models-logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)-were trained to construct four models: clinical-ultrasound (U), clinical-ultrasound with intratumoral radiomics (UI), clinical-ultrasound with peritumoral radiomics (UP), and clinical-ultrasound with combined intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics (UIP). RESULTS: The RF-based clinical-ultrasound model demonstrated the highest accuracy (test: 0.643) but exhibited significant overfitting in radiomics-based models. The SVM model showed moderate performance. The LR model in the UP and UIP models delivered stable performance, achieving the highest test accuracy of 0.643. Specifically, the UP model showed improved micro-AUC, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. The LR model exhibited high sensitivity but low specificity for benign nodules, and high specificity but low sensitivity for malignant nodules. All models performed poorly in identifying FT-UMP nodules. CONCLUSION: Integrating peritumoral radiomic features with clinical-ultrasound features using logistic regression enhances the differentiation between benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumors.</description>

Despite advances in radiation techniques and surgical management, reliable predictors of ORN prognosis remain lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between systemic inflammatory biomarkers and ORN prognosis. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study included patients with ORN treated between January 2010 and March 2022 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. Patients with unavailable blood test data were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variables were pretreatment systemic inflammatory biomarkers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). The cutoff values for NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and LMR were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Each marker was calculated at the time of diagnosis of ORN. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome variable was prognosis. Subjects had a good prognosis if the ORN stage improved. The prognosis was poor if the ORN stage was stable or worse over time. COVARIATES: Sex, age, stage, onset region, primary tumor site, radiation dose, smoking history, medical history, steroid therapy, clinical symptoms, treatment methods, and computed tomography image findings were covariates. ANALYSES: Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test, Fisher's exact test, χ2 test, and Cox regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 75 subjects, of whom 16 (21.3%) had a poor prognosis. The median follow-up period was 88 (53 to 122) months. Bivariate analysis revealed that high NLR (P &lt; .01) and low LMR (P = .02) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, poor prognosis was significantly associated with advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 5.33; 95% CI, 1.61 to 17.65; P &lt; .01), ORN stage 3, 4 (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.56; P &lt; .01), high NLR (HR, 14.78; 95% CI, 3.50 to 62.35; P &lt; .01), and periosteal reaction (HR, 19.15; 95% CI, 4.65 to 78.87; P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified high NLR as a risk factor for poor prognosis in ORN. High NLR is considered to reflect worse local tissue and systemic health.</description>

The Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could be maintained in this model for a certain period of time. This model was confirmed to simulate PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, providing a reliable in vitro model for the verification and clinical prediction of the therapeutic effects of relevant immunotherapy drugs for head and neck cancer (HNC). METHODS: Fresh tumor tissue samples were obtained to establish an ALI head and neck cancer organoid (ALI-HNCO) model. The oncological characteristics of the organoids and their homology with parental tumors were verified using histomorphological analysis. T lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the organoids were detected using immunofluorescence staining. After treating with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor), the secreted levels of the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and changes in the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ distributed in the immune microenvironment of the organoid, as well as the expression of CD69+ immune cell subsets, were analyzed using flow cytometry. The FVS staining assay was used to verify the killing of tumor cells by cytotoxic T cells. RESULTS: The comparison of immunofluorescence in organoids and parental tumor tissues showed that CD3+ lymphocytes and SMA+ cells were also present in the active organoid tissues. Approximately 17.86% (5/28) of the ALI-HNCO model could amplify specific reactive CD8+ T lymphocytes, generating tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. DISCUSSION: An in vitro HNC immune microenvironment model was successfully constructed using the ALI method. This model maintained the proportions and structures of the components of the original tumor, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts, for a period of time in vitro, providing an experimental platform for exploring the complex crosstalk between HNC cells and multiple cell colonies. This study preliminarily validated the feasibility of using ALI organoid models to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy drugs in treating HNC, providing a reliable and stable preclinical model, and new ideas for drug screening platforms for personalized precision medicine in HNC.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on UG-FNA results from 10,839 patients (12,528 nodules) at Deyang People's Hospital between December 2021 and September 2024. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) combined with cell block technology identified 732 Bethesda III nodules (detection rate: 5.8%). Among these, 180 cases with postoperative histological follow-up were analyzed, including 101 cases with preoperative BRAF V600E testing using cell blocks. Using histology (5th edition WHO classification) as the gold standard, the influence of gender, age, nodule location, diameter, and cytological subcategory (with nuclear atypia vs. with other features) on malignant risk was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The diagnostic value of BRAF V600E testing was evaluated. RESULTS: Among 180 Bethesda III nodules, malignancies accounted for 62.2% (112/180), predominantly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; 110/112, 98.2%), while low-risk neoplasms and benign lesions constituted 15.0% (27/180) and 22.8% (41/180), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified nodule size &lt;1 cm (P &lt; 0.001) and the "nuclear atypia" subcategory as independent predictors, with the latter showing extreme predictive value for malignancy (OR = 121.854, P &lt; 0.001; capturing 98.2% malignancies) and modest association with low-risk neoplasms (OR = 7.014, P = 0.001). BRAF V600E testing (n=101) demonstrated 82.0% sensitivity (100% specificity) for PTC but exhibited striking subtype-dependent performance (classical PTC: 90.2% [46/51] vs. FVPTC: 40.0% [4/10], P = 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that combined cytology-BRAF testing achieved AUCs of 0.873 (95%CI:0.797-0.948) for malignancy and 0.892 (95%CI:0.822-0.962) for PTC, though accuracy was significantly lower for FVPTC (AUC = 0.481) versus classical PTC (AUC = 0.911, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In Bethesda III nodules, a diameter &lt;1 cm or the "with nuclear atypia" subcategory indicates a high malignant risk (OR = 121.854), warranting active management. Preoperative BRAF V600E testing provides excellent detection for classical PTC (sensitivity 90.2%, specificity 100%) but exhibits limited sensitivity for FVPTC (40%). Based on the 3rd edition TBSRTC and 5th edition WHO classification, our risk-stratified algorithm could reduce unnecessary surgeries by 25-30% in indeterminate nodules while maintaining perfect specificity for classical PTC, achieving optimal clinical decision-making.</description>

Hence, laboratory parameter profiles are of considerable interest as potential perioperative predictors. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed a comprehensive set of laboratory parameters in 233 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) who underwent tumor resection and reconstruction. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 30%, with wound dehiscence (12.4%), pulmonary embolism (PE, 11.6%), and surgical revision (10.3%) being the most common complications. Dynamic analysis of perioperative laboratory parameters from one week before to 49 days after surgery revealed that patients who developed complications showed less pronounced decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte levels. These patients also exhibited altered coagulation and electrolyte profiles. Statistical analysis using logistic regression identified hematocrit slope as independent predictor. Meanwhile, random forest modeling highlighted INR and aPTT as key markers. Subgroup analysis showed that PE, the most clinically significant complication, was associated with abnormal potassium, urea, and protein profiles. Whereas a therapy-related increase in aPTT was observed postoperatively, INR alterations were already evident preoperatively. Conversely, local complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical revision, and graft failure were more strongly associated with deteriorating hematological parameters. DISCUSSION: Given their multifactorial nature, influenced by comorbidities, tumor biology, and perioperative management, these findings highlight the need for longitudinal laboratory monitoring and prospective validation in controlled settings. Integrating dynamic laboratory trends into multimodal prediction models may facilitate earlier risk stratification and improve individualized perioperative management in head and neck reconstructive surgery.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 48 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) salivary gland tissue sections (5 µm thickness) were analyzed, including 8 NP, 24 PA, and 16 MEC specimens. ATR-FTIR spectra were acquired directly from routine histopathological slides over the 4000-400 per cm range without chemical deparaffinization. The spectral data were then processed using multivariate analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA) to reveal biochemical variations among the tissue groups. Supervised classification was then performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) algorithms with 6-fold cross-validation to evaluate classification performance. RESULTS: Distinct spectral differences were detected among NP, PA, and MEC tissues, particularly in protein (amide I-II), lipid (CH-stretching), and nucleic acid (phosphate) regions. OPLS-DA demonstrated clear class discrimination (3D: J₁ = 4.1250, J₂ = 2.2121). The SVM classifier achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (F1-scores: NP = 1.00, PA = 0.96, MEC = 0.94; overall accuracy = 95.83%), outperforming the kNN model (accuracy = 93.75%). CONCLUSIONS: Combining ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with ML-based multivariate analysis provides a highly accurate method of differentiating NP, PA and MEC salivary gland tissues based on their biochemical fingerprints. This integrative approach establishes the basis for a rapid, non-invasive, label-free diagnostic tool that is compatible with clinical practice and applicable to routine histopathological samples.</description>

Following TL, many patients require repeat esophageal dilations to maintain swallowing function. This study aimed to identify surgical and non-surgical risk factors associated with dysphagia following TL, defined as clinically diagnosed postoperative dysphagia based on patient-reported symptoms and dysphagia requiring dilation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institution cohort study of patients who underwent total laryngectomy from 1999 to 2024. Outcomes included clinically diagnosed dysphagia and dysphagia requiring esophageal dilations, with covariates including age, BMI, preoperative PEG tube, cricomyotomy, flap reconstruction type, pharyngectomy, glossectomy, base of tongue resection, postoperative complication, neoadjuvant radiation, and adjuvant radiation. Associations between dysphagia and covariates were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 787 patients underwent total laryngectomy. Median follow-up was 28.5 months (Interquartile range [IQR]: 10.3-68.2 months). During the follow-up period, 212 patients (26.9 %) reported dysphagia, and 131 patients underwent dilation (16.6 %). Prior radiation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.51, 95 % CI: 1.56-4.05, p &lt; 0.001), adjuvant radiation (aOR: 1.86; 95 % CI 1.10 to 3.17; p = 0.021), and tongue base resection (aOR: 2.14, 95 % CI: 1.24-3.70, p = 0.006) were independently associated with postoperative clinical dysphagia. Total pharyngectomy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.83, 95 % CI 1.17-2.83, p = 0.008) was associated with dysphagia on univariable analysis. Pedicled reconstruction (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI 1.00-1.90, p = 0.053) showed a trend towards increased odds of clinical dysphagia. Only prior radiation was independently associated with dysphagia requiring esophageal dilation (aOR: 2.92, 95 % CI: 1.62-5.26, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is common following total laryngectomy. Prior radiation, adjuvant radiation, total pharyngectomy, tongue base resection, and pedicled reconstruction were factors influencing swallowing outcomes following TL. Salvage TL patients should be counseled on the possible need for post-laryngectomy esophageal dilations.</description>

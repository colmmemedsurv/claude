      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Baratz H, Renkert E, Li Y, McDaniels J, Yeatts J, Yeoh M, Montealegre DH, Yin L, Ishikawa K, Orbelo D, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70134'&gt;10.1002/hed.70134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41532281/'&gt;41532281&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Individuals with oral cavity cancer (OCC) have negatively impacted functional status and quality of life. Little is known regarding patients' perspectives of their speech impairments. This study compared self-reported speech function between patients surgically treated for OCC and healthy controls using the Speech Handicap Index (SHI) and identified factors associated with worse scores. METHODS: This is a multiinstitutional cross-sectional study of OCC patients and healthy controls recruited between July 2024 and March 2025. Participants completed the SHI and self-reported speech quality. Demographics, tumor, and treatment details were abstracted from the electronic health record for OCC. Group differences were assessed with t-tests, χ2, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Among 69 OCC and 90 controls, OCC patients had significantly higher mean SHI scores (50.2 vs. 34.7, p &lt; 0.01) and were less likely to rate their speech as "good" or "excellent" (47.8% vs. 85.6%, p &lt; 0.01). Both speech and psychosocial domain scores were significantly worse among OCC. Free flap reconstruction was associated with worse scores (29.6 vs. 15.5, p = 0.02) and worse self-rated speech quality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with surgically treated oral cavity cancer have significantly impaired self-perceived speech and psychosocial functioning compared with healthy individuals. Greater deficits were observed in patients who required free flap reconstruction. Despite the functional deficit, nearly half of OCC patients reported satisfaction with their speech quality. These findings highlight the importance of using validated measures for speech function and support the need for early, multidisciplinary rehabilitation including speech therapy in this population, particularly for those undergoing free flap reconstruction.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yap TA, Sweis RF, Vaishampayan U, Kilari D, Gainor JF, McKean M, Barve M, Tarhini AA, Bockorny B, Sonpavde G, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature medicine | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w'&gt;10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41530380/'&gt;41530380&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have revolutionized oncology, many cancers are unresponsive or develop resistance that involves transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1). This multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study (DRAGON trial, SRK-181-001) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, predictive biomarkers and efficacy of linavonkibart, a first-in-class fully human selective anti-latent TGFβ1 antibody with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The DRAGON trial was divided into three treatment parts: part A1 (dose-escalation cohorts with single-agent linavonkibart), part A2 (dose-escalation cohorts with the combination treatment of linavonkibart and pembrolizumab) and part B (dose-expansion cohorts with the combination treatment). The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of linavonkibart alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives included evaluation of linavonkibart pharmacokinetics for each treatment paradigm, assessment of anti-linavonkibart antibody development (parts A and B) and measurement of antitumor activity (part B) after treatment. All primary and secondary objectives were met in the study. Overall, linavonkibart had a manageable safety profile, and combined therapy with pembrolizumab was generally consistent with that of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Dermatological reactions were the only additional risk identified. Neither cytokine release syndrome nor infusion interruption was observed in any patient enrolled in DRAGON. In part A (n = 34), no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred (linavonkibart; ≤3,000 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 2,000 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W)). In part B (n = 78), patients progressing on prior anti-PD-1 therapy received linavonkibart (1,500 mg Q3W/1,000 mg Q2W) with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W). This combination demonstrated confirmed objective response rates of 20.0%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 9.1% in anti-PD-1-resistant patients with clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), melanoma, head and neck squamous cell cancer and urothelial cancer, respectively. Biomarker data provide proof of mechanism and a potential ccRCC patient selection strategy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04291079 .</description>

Abemaciclib targets this pathway and may offer therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting abemaciclib efficacy. METHODS: In the NGS-based TRIUMPH trial, patients with platinum-refractory HNSCC harboring CDK4/6 pathway alteration received abemaciclib, classified as "long stable disease (SD)" (progression-free survival [PFS] &gt; 6 months) and "short SD" (PFS &lt; 6 months). In this post hoc analysis, the genetic profiles were compared. In vitro studies were conducted to assess abemaciclib's antitumor effects in HNSCC cell lines. RESULTS: Among 23 patients, abemaciclib showed limited efficacy (overall response rate, 0%; disease control rate, 43.5%). CDKN2A deletion was significantly associated with long SD (p = 0.0078), unlike CCND1 amplification and CDKN2A mutation. In vitro, CDKN2A-deleted cell lines showed greater sensitivity to abemaciclib. CONCLUSIONS: Although abemaciclib resulted in limited tumor regression, CDKN2A deletion may be a predictive biomarker for prolonged disease stabilization. Further investigations on genomically selected populations and combination strategies are required.</description>

However, there is a clear need for improved prognostic tools. This study aimed to identify immune-related tissue biomarkers associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 inhibition. This national real-world phase IV multicenter retrospective cohort study included Danish patients treated between 2017 and 2023. Pre-treatment biopsies were collected for immunohistochemical analyses. All patients were PD-L1 positive with histologically confirmed rmHNSCC treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Biomarker expression was assessed for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20, CD66b, CD68, STING, cGAS, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), using the median expression as the cut-off value. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was obtained from 263 eligible patients. Concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 were associated with a lower risk of progression (HRPFS: 0.47 [95 % CI: 0.33-0.67]). This interaction appeared to be driven by p16+ oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), where patients with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 showed a median 2-year PFS of 68 % [95 % CI: 42-86] in contrast to those with one or none of the two markers above the median level with a 2-year PFS of 3 % [95 % CI: 0-12] (p &lt; 0.001). In this real-world cohort, a subgroup with a promising prognosis was identified. This subgroup was characterized by p16+ OPC along with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68. PD-L1 alone showed no significant association with outcomes.</description>

Radiotherapy represents an alternative curative treatment option to preserve oral function, however, there are few reports on the use of radiotherapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the hard palate (SCCHP). High-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy has been known as an effective treatment for SCCHP, which seems to be less invasive when mold technique is used. In our hospital, the HDR customized mold brachytherapy (HDR- customized MBT) is available for patients with SCCHP. This study aimed to report the efficacy and toxicity of HDR- customized MBT for patients with early-stage SCCHP. CASE PRESENTATION: Four patients with early-stage SCCHP were treated with mainly HDR- customized MBT between June 2015 and May 2023. Three of four patients received the combined radiotherapy: one patient underwent short-term external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) before the HDR- customized MBT; two patients underwent single-fraction interstitial brachytherapy before HDR- customized MBT. The total biological effective dose was 77-110 Gy (α/β = 10). All patients completed HDR- customized MBT with or without the combined radiotherapy and experienced no local recurrence. The acute toxicity was only mucositis limited to the irradiated area: one case with EBRT developed grade 2 mucositis. Only this case had late grade 2 mucositis; no late adverse events were observed in the other cases. No oral dysfunction or cosmetic problems occurred in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study might show that HDR-customized MBT is useful for early-stage SCCHP and might be an alternative curative treatment option for them to preserve oral function.</description>

This study aimed to identify the optimal age threshold and evaluate its association with overall survival (OS) to improve risk stratification and inform individualized treatment strategies. METHODS: Data were extracted from the SEER database (2018-2021), the University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, and the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCC). Only HPV-positive OPC cases with complete survival records were included. The optimal age threshold was identified using restricted cubic spline modeling in combination with a recursive partitioning approach. Prognostic factors beyond HPV status and AJCC eighth edition stage were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to construct a risk stratification model. The primary endpoint was OS. RESULTS: Of the 10 283 eligible patients (87.9% male; median age, 62 years), 2.7% had distant metastases at diagnosis. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed that 62 years of age represents an important critical threshold. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that patients younger than 62 years exhibited significantly improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70; p &lt; 0.001). RPA stratified patients into five risk groups with distinct 2-year OS: extremely low (96.8%), low (93.7%), intermediate (86.1%), high (74.6%), and extremely high risk (47.5%). Among patients classified in the extremely low-risk group (T0-2N0-1M0 and younger than 62 years), no significant difference in OS was observed between those treated with radiotherapy alone and those treated with chemoradiotherapy. External validation in the UHN (N = 843) and NCC (N = 167) cohorts suggested that extremely low-risk patients might be spared concurrent chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a risk stratification model for patients with p16-positive OPC based on the AJCC eighth edition staging and age. Patients in the extremely low-risk group may derive limited benefit from concurrent chemotherapy, suggesting that its omission could be considered in selected patients and may help guide the design of future de-escalation trials.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with SGSC between 2011 and 2021 were included. We analyzed clinicopathological features, incidence trends, and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 36.5 months, the overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.93% and 86.53%, respectively. The incidence of SGSC has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of 6.3 cases per year in 2011-2013 to 29.3 cases per year in 2019-2021. This increase was predominantly driven by early-stage (I/II) tumors (75.9%), with the parotid gland being the most common primary site. Multivariable analysis identified age &gt; 55 years and AJCC Stage IV disease as independent poor prognostic factors. Surgical intervention, including local tumor excision and glandectomy, was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Notably, patients who received a combination of surgery and radiotherapy had better outcomes compared to those who received either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study with extended follow-up clarifies the rising incidence and early-stage predominance of SGSC. Age, TNM stage, and surgical treatment were identified as key prognostic factors.</description>

DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on studies employing TORS in HPV-associated OPSCC. Meta-analysis of continuous measures, proportions, and comparison of weighted proportion and relative risk were performed for patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies, comprising 16,129 adults treated with TORS for OPSCC, were included. The mean age was 59.5 years (SD 2.08) (range 18-93), with an average follow-up of 43.4 months (SD 13.36); 83.5% of the cohort was male, and 85.6% had HPV-positive OPSCC. In the HPV-positive group, TORS survival rates were 91.0% at 1 year, 94.9% at 3 years, and 89.8% at 5 years. In comparison, the HPV-negative group had survival rates of 92.3%, 84.2%, and 72.9%, respectively. Significant survival differences were observed between cohorts at 3 and 5 years (P &lt; .0001). The HPV-positive group had a significantly higher likelihood of 5-year overall survival compared to the HPV-negative group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34) Recurrence rates in HPV-positive patients were 2.0% local, 3.1% regional, and 5.3% locoregional, whereas HPV-negative patients had recurrence rates of 7.6% local, 6.0% regional, and 9.1% locoregional (P = .0037, .2143, .426, respectively). Distant metastasis rates were 5.6% in HPV-positive and 10.2% in HPV-negative patients (P = .0033). CONCLUSION: The higher survival rates and lower recurrences in HPV-positive OPSCC patients compared to their HPV-negative counterparts reflects the favorable long-term oncologic outcome seen in HPV-associated OPSCC.</description>

However, there is a lack of established planning guidelines for URT treatment leading to suboptimal optimization of contralateral and midline organs at risk (OARs). This study aimed to re-optimize URT plans to maximize sparing of midline and contralateral OAR's while maintaining target coverage, providing dosimetric guidelines for URT planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment plan data for patients treated with URT on XXXX were re-optimized using Eclipse V16.01. All relevant midline and OAR contours were contoured to align with international OAR consensus guidelines. Treatment plans were re-optimized, aiming for maximal midline and contralateral sparing while maintaining XXXX protocol-mandated target coverage (GTV: D100%&gt;95%; PTV: D95%&gt;95%). A second re-optimisation was performed to align with NRG acceptance criteria (PTV: D95%&gt;100%). RESULTS: All re-optimized plans achieved the XXXX and NRG protocol target volume coverage. Clinically meaningful reductions in dose to the pharyngeal constrictors (trial delivered plan vs XXXX re-optimized plan, median of mean dose, 48.5 Gy vs 37.4 Gy, estimated mean difference [ED] -9.5Gy, p&lt;0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (14.9 vs 6.7 Gy, ED -11.0, p&lt;0.001) and larynx (22.1 vs 12.1, ED -12.2, p&lt;0.001). Improvements were also seen in contralateral parotid gland (9.2 vs 4.9, ED -5.0, p&lt;0.001) and oral cavity (39.5 vs 35.9, ED -3.0, p&lt;0.001), which were considered less likely to be clinically relevant. There was no increase in dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral mandible. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this re-optimization study provide planning guidelines to guide dosimetrists and radiation oncologists on achievable OAR sparing when delivering URT.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, non-randomized phase II trial enrolled patients with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory R/M HNSCC. In Cohort A, a single lesion was treated with SBRT while other sites were left unirradiated. In Cohort B, all known oligometastatic lesions were treated with SBRT. Pembrolizumab was administered every 3 weeks in both cohorts. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS). Correlative immune analyses were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using mass cytometry and TCRβ sequencing. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (6 in Cohort A, 12 in Cohort B). Median PFS was 1.8 months in Cohort A and 5.7 months in Cohort B. The 3-month PFS rate was 17% (1/6) in Cohort A and 67% (8/12) in Cohort B, with an overall response rate of 25% (3/12) in Cohort B and no objective responses in Cohort A. Median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: [0.7-32.9])in Cohort A and 10.1 months (95% CI: [5.8-49.7]) in Cohort B. In Cohort B there were 2 (2/12, 17%) Grade 4 toxicities observed in the setting of re-irradiation. Correlative studies showed that patients with PFS &gt;3 months had higher baseline frequencies of CD8+ central memory T cells and elevated CXCR5 expression on memory B cells. CONCLUSIONS: In anti PD-1-refractory R/M HNSCC, SBRT with pembrolizumab was safe and feasible, suggesting activity when all progressing lesions were treated. Immune profiling describes pre-existing memory T and B cell phenotypes that appear to correlate with treatment benefit. These findings support further study and clinical use of comprehensive SBRT plus PD-1 blockade in this hard-to-treat population.</description>

Retrospective studies suggest excellent local control with single vocal cord irradiation that targets only the affected vocal cord. So, the aim of this study was to compare the treatment outcome and toxicity of the classic radiotherapy field vs single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI) technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective phase 2 randomized study (clinicaltrial.gov registration NCT05679856). A total of 57 patients with T1aN0 glottic cancer were randomized. 28 were assigned to standard of care whole larynx radiotherapy that covers the whole larynx with a prescription dose of 63 Gy/28 Fractions (Fs) The remaining 29 patients were randomized to single vocal irradiation with a prescription dose of 58.08 Gy/16Fs. The primary endpoint was to prove superiority of SVCI in terms of voice quality by comparing voice handicap index (VHI) between the 2 study arms. Baseline VHI was recorded before treatment, at end of radiotherapy then during each follow up visit. RESULTS: Demographic and patients' characteristics were comparable between the 2 arms. The dose to different organs at risk were statistically lower in the SVCI arm. 2-year local control rate was 100% in SVCI arm and 96% in the whole larynx arm, with no significant difference. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were reported in both treatment arms. Patients in the SVCI arm demonstrated lower VHI scores at 2 months and 1-year post-treatment, with median scores of 4 and 0, respectively, compared with 22 and 21 in the whole-larynx arm. CONCLUSION: SVCI is effective and safe treatment for T1aN0 glottic cancer with comparable local control rates and safe toxicity profile. SVCI was associated with superior voice outcome as evidenced by significantly improved VHI scores compared with whole larynx radiotherapy.</description>

We hypothesized that personalization of fractionation using PSI would increase the percentage of patients achieving a rapid reduction in tumor size during radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage human papillomavirus related squamous cancers of the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center nonrandomized phase 2 single arm trial, 113 patients underwent screening, and 57 patients were consented and enrolled. Pretreatment PSI was calculated, and patients were assigned to 60 - 70 Gy in 30 - 35 fractions given once daily (PSI≤ 0.75) or 60 - 69.6 Gy in in 50 - 58 fractions given twice daily (PSI&gt;0.75). The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of patients with ≥ 32% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks of RT, with a planned sample size of 60 patients, with an interim analysis after 49 patients. Secondary end points included locoregional failure (LRF), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 55 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint were consented and enrolled, and 32 (58%; 95% CI = 44%-71%) met the primary endpoint of ≥ 32% reduction at 4 weeks of RT, meeting criteria for efficacy, leading to early study closure. For the 54 patients evaluable for secondary endpoints, the cumulative incidence of LRF at 2 years was 2% (95% CI: 0-5.8), with a 2-year PFS of 92% (95% CI: 85-100), and a 2 year OS of 96% (95% CI: 91-100). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized RT fractionation based on PSI suggests a promising rate of mid-treatment response with favorable LF, PFS, and OS.

This study, therefore, aims to develop tumor control probability (TCP) models. METHODS: Dose-time modeling of TCP was performed for three key dose descriptors: 3-fraction equivalent dose (3fxED) prescription dose, 3fxED planning target volume (PTV) D95%, and 3fxED PTV D2%. Each dose descriptor was stratified into 4 dose groups using a k-medians clustering algorithm, and the Kaplan-Meier estimator was computed in each group separately to enable time-dependent dose-response modeling. Logistic regression models were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation with model parameters determined separately for 1-year and 2-year local control. RESULTS: This retrospective multicenter analysis included 318 pulmonary metastases from 215 patients. The median 3fxED prescription dose was 45.0 Gy (IQR, 39.2-46.5), corresponding to a biologically effective dose (α/β = 20 Gy) (BED20) of 78.8  Gy (IQR, 64.8-82.5). After a median radiographic follow-up of 13.3 months (IQR, 6.6-32.0), 21 local failures were observed. All models indicated a dose-dependent effect on the local control probability. A local control rate of 95 % was achieved at 1 and 2 years when 3fxED prescription doses and PTV D95% exceeded about 51 Gy (94 Gy BED20), and when PTV D2% reached 66 Gy (139 Gy BED20). CONCLUSION: These TCP models suggest a dose-dependent probability of local control in pulmonary HNSCC metastases treated with SBRT and provide a basis for future clinical assessments in this population.</description>

We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine the survival outcomes and resource utilization of patients with R/M SCCHNC who were treated with nivolumab. METHOD: Patients with R/M SCCHNC were included in the study if they received nivolumab between January 17th 2018 to August 31st 2022 in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), were assessed using Kaplan-Meier. Cox proportional hazard model was used to explore the association between baseline patient characteristics and all-cause death. The incidence of healthcare utilization was estimated using the cumulative incidence function, taking death as a competing event. RESULTS: A total of 498 R/M SCCHNC patients received nivolumab (Mean age 62.9, 78.7 % male). The median OS was 6.0 months (95 % CI: 5.0-7.3) and median time-to-treatment discontinuation was 2.6 months (95 % CI: 2.3-3.0). There is no significant OS difference between older patients (age &gt; 75 years old) and younger patients (p-value 0.73). At 1-year post-nivolumab initiation, the cumulative incidence of emergency department visits is 50.6 % (95 % CI: 46.1-55.0 %) and direct hospitalization is 22.7 % (19.0-26.6 %). CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the survival outcomes of nivolumab were similar to those observed in CheckMate-141 trial. We demonstrated that there is no survival difference between older and younger patients. Furthermore, more than half of patients exaperienced an hospital encounter with the healthcare system, suggesting significant healthcare resource utilization.</description>

The impact of perioperative extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage remains unclear. This study hypothesizes that calculated prophylaxis with piperacillin/tazobactam reduces early-onset SSI in this high-risk population. METHODS: From a microvascular reconstructed cohort, 161 with prior irradiation were retrospectively identified (tumor, N = 101; ORN, N = 60). SSI risk reduction was compared between patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (N = 39) and standard prophylaxis (N = 122). RESULTS: With underlying SSI incidence of 36%, piperacillin/tazobactam showed a fourfold SSI risk reduction (HR 0.24; p = 0.002) across the entire cohort and a fivefold reduction in patients with bone resection (HR 0.17; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses confirmed this effect with a sevenfold reduction in tumor patients (HR 0.14; p = 0.008) and a threefold reduction in ORN patients (HR 0.29; p = 0.04). Extended coverage did not significantly prolong antibiotic treatment times. CONCLUSION: In summary, calculated use of piperacillin/tazobactam in previously irradiated patients requiring microvascular reconstruction appears effective in reducing early-onset SSI.</description>

Despite its high incidence (6.0 per 100,000 males; 2.3 per 100,000 females) and poor prognosis, no molecular biomarkers exist for early detection. Non-invasive sampling could improve diagnosis and patient outcomes. METHODS: This pilot study used RNA sequencing to identify significantly upregulated mRNA targets in swab samples from oral and oropharyngeal SCC patients and healthy probands. After filtering, four potential biomarkers were further validated in 79 samples using RT-qPCR. CombiROC analysis assessed diagnostic performance. Additional RT-qPCR on tumour and normal tissues and fluorescence staining in FFPE tumour sections evaluated expression at mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: A panel of three markers (c-JUN, SFN, HSP90AB1) showed high diagnostic accuracy: 92.3% specificity, 92.3% sensitivity, and AUC of 0.91. Fluorescence staining confirmed significantly higher protein expression in tumour tissues, supporting RNA findings. The panel showed stronger diagnostic performance in men than in women. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising non-invasive biomarker panel for oral and oropharyngeal SCC detection. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm diagnostic value and clarify sex specificity. The approach is adaptable to other tumour types and sample materials, supporting molecular diagnostics. The workflow shows all project steps from sampling to marker localisation in FFPE tissue. In the discovery phase, RNA sequencing was used to find potential mRNA markers in swab samples. Via strict filtering, markers for RT-qPCR were selected and verified in a bigger cohort in the validation phase. Selected markers were then used to do combinatorial analysis to improve the specificity and sensitivity compared to that of the single markers. Finally, markers were verified and localised in primary oral and oropharyngeal SCC FFPE tissue. Created with BioRender.com.</description>

This study evaluated risk-adjusted dental utilization patterns and associated healthcare costs among patients with OOC in Medicare and commercially insured populations. METHODS: Using the 2013-2024 Merative™ MarketScan® Research Databases, individuals with at least one medical claim for OOC were identified and matched 1:1 to non-OOC controls using propensity score matching. Analyses were stratified by insurance type (Medicare vs. commercial). Outcomes included frequency of dental visits, types of dental procedures, treatment modalities, and total annual healthcare costs. RESULTS: The prevalence of OOC was 67 per 100,000 among commercially insured and 397 per 100,000 among Medicare enrollees. Compared with controls, OOC patients were older and predominantly male (all p&lt;0.01). OOC patients had significantly fewer annual dental visits than controls (2.79 vs. 2.98 [Medicare]; 2.81 vs. 3.20 [Commercial], all p&lt;.0001). Restoration and periodontal treatments were the most common dental procedures. Surgical treatment alone was more frequent among OOC patients (20.1% Medicare; 15.6% Commercial). The risk-adjusted total annual healthcare burden was $22,984 for Medicare and $47,542 for Commercial OOC patients (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher medical costs and intensive cancer treatment, OOC patients had fewer dental visits, indicating a gap in survivorship care. IMPACT: These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated medical-dental care models and policies that enhance access to preventive and restorative dental services, potentially reducing complications, improving quality of life, and lowering healthcare costs among OOC survivors.</description>

Its role in reducing postoperative complications in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 415 OSCC patients undergoing radical resection with free flap reconstruction. After propensity score matching, 174 well-matched pairs were analyzed. Patients were divided into a tooth cleaning group (n = 174) and a control group (n = 174). Outcomes included postoperative pneumonia (PP), surgical site infection (SSI), fever, length of stay, and unplanned reoperation were recorded. RESULTS: Preoperative tooth cleaning was significantly associated with lower PP risk (OR = 0.30). Significant independent risk factors for PP included tumor location at the floor of the mouth (OR = 4.70), hypertension (OR = 2.93), and longer operative duration (OR = 1.33 per hour). The radiographic severity of periodontitis was not a significant risk factor for PP. No associations were found between tooth cleaning and other outcomes. Stratified analyses showed significant protective effects in patients aged &gt; 60 years (OR = 0.19), with hypertension (OR = 0.08), periodontitis (OR = 0.07), or surgeries &gt; 5 h (OR = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Preoperative professional tooth cleaning one day before surgery is associated with a reduced risk of PP in OSCC patients.</description>

While associated with poor prognosis in various malignancies, characterization of ISTDs in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is limited. METHODS: This single-center cohort study examined 11 cases of PTC with ISTDs. Multi-platform next-generation sequencing analyzing driver mutations and tumor suppressor loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was performed on primary tumors, lymph nodes, and ISTDs. Clinical and histopathologic features were compared to a 3:1 matched control cohort. RESULTS: Genomic alterations were identical across paired tumors, lymph nodes, and ISTDs. LOH was present in 78% of cases with driver mutations. Compared to controls, ISTD cases demonstrated increased rates of high lymph node burden (p &lt; 0.01), extranodal extension (p = 0.012), and lymphovascular invasion (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Associated with aggressive disease features, the molecular profiles of ISTDs mirror primary tumors and lymph node metastases.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Adults undergoing parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation between 2018 and 2023 were included. Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 740 tumors were analyzed (353 benign, 387 malignant). Antegrade dissection was performed in 288 cases (194 malignant), retrograde in 334 (167 malignant), and extracapsular in 118 (26 malignant). Transient and permanent facial weakness occurred in 20% and 5% of cases. After adjustment, extracapsular dissection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.7, P = .0058) significantly reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade dissection. Retrograde dissection (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P = .11) demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of transient weakness relative to antegrade dissection. In malignant tumors, outcomes were similar across approaches. Extracapsular dissection was rarely used in malignant disease and reserved for selected cases. Antegrade dissection had longer operative times in benign and malignant tumors (P &lt; .001). Perioperative complication rates, unplanned visits, recurrence, re-operations, ED visits, and readmissions were low and not significantly different across techniques. CONCLUSION: In benign parotidectomy, extracapsular dissection significantly reduced transient facial weakness, while retrograde dissection demonstrated a trend toward reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade. In malignant disease, outcomes were similar across approaches. Selective application of extracapsular and retrograde techniques may optimize facial nerve outcomes and operative efficiency.</description>

However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective secondary analysis used single-institution prospective registries of HNC patients treated with RT who completed the MDASI-HN and a modified barium swallow (MBS) before, during, or after RT. The DynamicImaging Grade ofSwallowing Toxicity(DIGEST) overall (D), efficiency (E), and safety (S) scores were compared to a priori-defined (≥6) and data-driven thresholds using binomial regression. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), PPV and NPV, using DIGEST D, E, S ≥ 1 (any impairment) and ≥ 2 (moderate-severe) as reference standards. RESULTS: Among 264 patients (mean age 62; 87 % male; 47 % nasopharyngeal cancer; 55 % post-RT), -Swallow ≥ 6 was associated with D ≥ 1 and D ≥ 2 (RRs = 1.8-2.6, p &lt; 0.05), showing high SP (92-95 %) but low SN (23-30 %). -Choke ≥ 6 demonstrated stronger associations for D ≥ 2 (RR = 3.5, p &lt; 0.05), and similar SN/SP tradeoffs. Data-driven thresholds improved accuracy: for D ≥ 1, a combined threshold (-Swallow or -Choke) ≥ 2 yielded SN 77 %, SP 64 %; for D ≥ 2, -Choke ≥ 1 showed SN 85 %, SP 69 %, while -Choke ≥ 2 increased SP to 84 %. For aspiration risk (S ≥ 2), -Choke ≥ 1 had SN 88 %, SP 66 %; -Choke ≥ 2 improved SP to 83 %. CONCLUSION: MDASI-Swallow and -Choke correlate with imaging-based dysphagia. While ≥ 6 may flag moderate-severe impairment, lower thresholds (≥1-2) offer better sensitivity, supporting early detection. Combined thresholds may enhance screening and guide survivorship care.</description>

Inaccuracies contribute to delayed diagnosis and poor outcomes. Tobacco-related changes in oral mucosa may compromise the accuracy of oral screening approaches, and, in emerging "smart" screening modalities, they may overshadow the influence of other predictive variables. The objective of this study was to evaluate the screening accuracy of an imaging- and risk factor-based OC screening platform in individuals practicing different types of tobacco usage. Methods: 318 subjects who had previously screened positive for increased OC risk were recruited and sorted into "tobacco smoker", "tobacco vaper", "tobacco chewer", "hookah user", "multiple tobacco usage", or "tobacco non-user" groups. Next, demographic information, risk factors, outcome of clinical examination, as well as AFI and pWLI were recorded using a prototype OC screening platform. The OC risk assessment outcome from the OC screening platform was compared to that from an oral medicine specialist. Results: The screening platform demonstrated high sensitivity in tobacco chewers and hookah users, and it also exceeded 90% in smokers, vapers, and multi-product users. In tobacco non-users, 80% screening sensitivity was recorded. Screening specificity was considerably better in tobacco non-users than in the tobacco-user groups, and low in tobacco chewers (33.3%), vapers (55.6%), and smokers (62.5%). Across all groups, agreement between the screening platform outcome and specialist evaluation exceeded 80%. Significant differences in probe accuracy were noted between tobacco non-users and users (p &lt; 0.05), except for tobacco vapers. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need to consider the effects of type of tobacco use on the OC screening approach, and to integrate these variables into imaging-and risk-factor-based algorithms for OC screening.</description>

Intraoperative navigation (iNav) represents the most translatable technology among both the model-comparative and integrative surgical navigation technologies to optimize surgical outcomes. METHODS: A scoping review of the literature was performed according to PRISMA guidelines from 1970 to present (February 2025), investigating the use of iNav in cases of pHNC. Patient case details and authors' perception of iNav's utility were analyzed. A single-center retrospective case series review (September 2022 to September 2025) of the senior authors' experience employing iNav in pHNC cases was also performed. RESULTS: The scoping review identified twenty-seven cases of pHNC from sixteen studies that both utilized iNav and met the inclusion criteria. Many of the authors commented favorably on the utility of iNav technology, while concurrently agreeing upon its limitations. The case series review identified five cases of pHNC that met the inclusion criteria. This small case series revealed a 100% R0 resection rate with the use of iNav in four pHNC resections. The fifth case used iNav for biopsy site selection. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our scoping review as well as our institutional experience with this technology demonstrate its utility in guiding surgical approach, confirming depth of resection, and navigating marginal assessment. This study was limited by incidental and incomplete reporting of iNav's clinical application to pHNC; several extensive institutional reports had to be excluded due to insufficiently detailed data linkage. Our review builds upon the existing pediatric surgical literature, anchoring the evidentiary justification for the application of iNav to pediatric head and neck surgery.</description>

However, there is limited consensus on optimal sampling strategies, storage methods, and analytical approaches. This narrative review critically evaluates current strategies for sampling, preservation, DNA extraction, sequencing, and data analysis in oral microbiome research related to oral cancer. We compared commonly used sampling methods, including saliva, oral rinse, swab, brush, and tissue biopsy, and reviewed preservation conditions, extraction kits, sequencing platforms, and analytical pipelines reported in recent oral microbiome studies. Sampling approaches affect microbial yield and site specificity. Saliva and oral rinse samples are convenient and noninvasive but may dilute lesion-specific microbial signals, whereas lesion-directed swabbing or brushing yields greater microbial biomass and biological relevance. Preservation media and storage temperature significantly influence microbial stability, and DNA extraction methods vary in their ability to remove host DNA. Although 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains the most common approach, shotgun metagenomics offers higher resolution and function insights but is still limited by clinical applicability. Differences in data pre- and post-processing models and normalization strategies further contribute to inconsistent microbial profiles. Given that oral mucosal sites differ markedly in structure and microenvironment, careful consideration is required to ensure that collected samples accurately represent the biological question being addressed. Methodological consistency across all workflow stages-from collection to analysis-is essential to generate reproducible, high-quality data and to enable reliable translation of oral microbiome research into clinical applications for cancer detection and risk assessment. Together, these insights provide a framework to guide future study design and support the development of clinically applicable microbiome-based biomarkers.</description>

While most cSCC cases can be treated with surgery, locally advanced, metastatic, and high-risk cSCC tumors are associated with a worse prognosis with higher rates of recurrence and require multimodality therapy. However, there is limited data on animal models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma for the use of combinatory immunotherapy and radiation. Methods: In this study, spontaneously generated tumors using DMBA/TPA were treated over three weeks with either IgG control, anti-PD1 antibody monotherapy, 8 Gy of localized radiation, or a combination of anti-PD1 and 8 Gy of radiation followed by anti-PD1 therapy. Results: We found that while anti-PD1 therapy showed a trend toward slowed tumor growth compared to controls, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.0775), with most mice showing continued tumor progression. Preliminary histological analysis suggested that anti-PD1 treatment increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, and the addition of radiation further enhanced CD8+ responses but added greater variability. A pathologic review revealed that irradiated tumors were associated with fibroblastic spindle-like cell morphology. Conclusions: This animal model represents a potential preclinical model for studying CSCC with limited responses to immunotherapy to understand potential mechanisms of resistance.</description>

METHODS: Germline and somatic RET testing were performed in 164 MTC patients (105 sporadic, 59 hereditary) consecutively enrolled at a single tertiary center (2021-2024) using genomic DNA or DNA extracted from fresh surgical or paraffin-embedded pathology specimens. RESULTS: Hereditary MTC (hMTC) accounted for 59/164 (35.9%) cases. Among hMTC, 58/59 (98.3%) had MEN2 (72.4% classic, 5.2% with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis, 5.2% with Hirschsprung disease, and 17.2% with familial medullary thyroid carcinoma), and 1/59 (1.7%) had MEN3. Codon 634 mutations were the most prevalent (33/59, 55.9%). Extracellular cysteine-rich domain mutations were significantly more prevalent in syndromic cases (p = 0.006), while non-cysteine mutations were predominant in apparently sporadic cases (p = 0.006). In advanced MTC (stage III/IV or metastatic), the somatic M918T mutation was the most common (15/20, 75% cases). CONCLUSIONS: Germline RET screening is mandatory for all MTC cases. Somatic testing is critical in advanced disease, where M918T prevails in 75% of cases and guides tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Codon 634 is the most frequent mutation in Romanian MTC, highlighting regional variation warranting population-adjusted screening and earlier prophylactic thyroidectomy.</description>

The main risk factors include tobacco, alcohol, or human papilloma virus (HPV) viral infections, which contribute to HNC development through various, mostly unknown, mechanisms. One of these postulated mechanisms is cellular senescence. This biological aging-associated process is responsible not only for the arrest of cellular growth and division but also mediates the modulation of cell metabolism and secretory phenotype. Consequently, it may play a crucial role in carcinogenesis, which makes it an interesting topic in the context of cancer development, prognosis, prevention, and therapy. This review focuses on the current state of knowledge regarding all aspects of the association between cellular senescence and head and neck cancer.</description>

Achieving adequate resection while minimising surgical risk is important. This retrospective study investigated the role of the lymph node yield for the survival of patients with HNSCC. Methods: A total of 234 patients with advanced HNSCC who were treated at a German university hospital between 1997 and 2018 were analysed. The analysis included patient data, tumour-specific characteristics, and the extent of neck dissection performed. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, supplemented by Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results: The median age was 60.0 years (range: 30-85 years, interquartile range: 12.3 years). The follow-up period covered up to 25 years. According to the Union for International Cancer Control, n = 64 patients had UICC-stage III, and 170 patients had UICC-stage IV. The above-average lymph node yield was superior to average, but especially to below-average lymph node yields in bilateral (2.9-fold), ipsilateral (2.6-fold), and contralateral (10.7-fold) neck dissection. In particular, contralateral neck dissection was found to correlate with a significantly better prognosis in terms of overall survival when a higher number of lymph nodes were removed. Conclusions: The study suggests that a thorough and careful neck dissection involving the removal of a greater number of lymph nodes and including the contralateral side could significantly improve the survival for patients with advanced HNSCC.</description>

This review explores the range of diagnostic techniques utilized to assess the HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) status in OPSCC. It covers both traditional methods-such as p16 immunohistochemistry, HPV in situ hybridization, and DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-and newer, evolving strategies including circulating HPV tumor DNA analysis and oral HPV DNA/mRNA PCR testing. DISCUSSION: There are currently several histopathologic techniques for the diagnosis of HPV-associated OPSCC. This complexity of care has led to guidelines from numerous authorities (NCCN, ASCO, CAP), which this paper discusses and summarizes for head and neck oncology specialists. CONCLUSION: The ability to detect HPV in HPV-associated OPSCC is imperative for diagnosis, prognostication, staging, and management of the disease. Advances including liquid biopsy (TTMV-HPV DNA) may be utilized as an adjunct to diagnosis, treatment, and cancer surveillance in the future.</description>

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has historically failed to improve overall survival (OS) in mixed head and neck cohorts, although contemporary HPV-stratified series suggest NAC may enable treatment de-escalation. We aimed to narratively synthesize OPSCC-specific evidence on NAC focusing on primary and nodal response, pathologic complete response (pCR), survival, and functional outcomes. Methods: We conducted a narrative review of PubMed, selecting primary studies in which OPSCC outcomes were reported separately (surgery- or chemoradiotherapy [CRT]-based strategies; HPV status when available). We extracted study design, treatment regimens, response outcomes, survival, and toxicity data. Results: Pre-HPV studies showed variable responses and no consistent OS advantage over locoregional therapy. In the HPV era, non-comparative cohorts of NAC followed by transoral surgery reported substantial downstaging and high pCR rates at both the primary site and regional nodes, with 3-5-year OS frequently ≥80%. NAC+CRT paradigms demonstrated high clinical CR rates and OS exceeding 80-90%, and lower feeding-tube dependence and reduced swallowing morbidity in de-escalated regimens. Comparative retrospective series suggest NAC + surgery may be associated with lower rates of distant metastases and feeding-tube use compared with CRT or upfront surgery, although interpretation is limited by selection bias, regimen heterogeneity, and small sample sizes. Conclusions: While randomized trials have not established an OS advantage for NAC over standard CRT in head and neck cancer overall, HPV-positive OPSCC shows emerging evidence that systemic intensification with NAC may enable surgical and/or radiation de-escalation with promising oncologic and functional outcomes.</description>

Increasing reports of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) developing adjacent to DIs have raised concerns regarding the interaction between implants, chronic inflammation, and genetically altered mucosa. METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed/MEDLINE search was performed through June 2025 to identify English- or Spanish-language publications reporting primary OSCC occurring in proximity to DIs. Extracted variables included patient demographics, tumor site, clinical presentation, presence of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) or prior OSCC, peri-implant inflammation, management, and outcomes. Cases describing clinical features compatible with field-altered mucosa (e.g., OPMD or prior OSCC) were evaluated descriptively, recognizing that formal histopathologic or molecular evidence of OFC was rarely reported. RESULTS: A total of 105 implant-associated OSCC cases were identified. The mean patient age was 66.8 years (range: 40-90), with a female predominance (1.3:1). The mandible was the most frequently involved site (86.7%). A prior history of OPMD or OSCC was reported in 53 patients (50.5%), and peri-implantitis preceding diagnosis in 21 cases (19.0%). The most common clinical presentations were exophytic (59.0%) and ulcerated (37.1%) lesions, frequently mimicking peri-implantitis and contributing to diagnostic delay. Reported outcomes included recurrence in 11 cases (10.5%) and death in 13 cases (12.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence suggests that implant-associated OSCC frequently occurs in patients with pre-existing mucosal alterations and may be influenced by the interaction of field cancerization with local inflammatory and mechanical factors. Implant rehabilitation in individuals with OPMD, prior OSCC, or epithelial dysplasia should be undertaken cautiously, with rigorous long-term surveillance to ensure oncologic safety.</description>

Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) are particularly vulnerable to FT due to lower rates of return to work and higher out-of-pocket payments (OOPP). In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the amount and types of OOPP, as well as the prevalence of FT, in HNC patients who had completed curative radiotherapy. Methods: We included HNC patients who underwent curative-intent radiotherapy at four private clinics in Romania, within 12 months of completing treatment. Participants completed a 25-item questionnaire capturing sociodemographic information, insurance status, income, and OOPP. To assess subjective FT, we used the validated nine-item Financial Index of Toxicity (FIT), which measures three FT domains: financial stress, financial strain, and lost productivity. Each domain and the total score range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater financial toxicity. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient characteristics. Pearson's chi-square, t-tests, and one-way ANOVA were used to assess statistical associations, with a significance threshold of p &lt; 0.05. Results: Among 113 patients (mean age: 59), the majority were male (74.3%) and married (74.3%), with 40% having completed university or higher education. The most frequent tumor sites were the oropharynx (29 cases), larynx (22), and oral cavity (21). Concurrent chemoradiation was the most common treatment modality (47%). The mean total FT score was 18.8. Overall, 39.8% of patients experienced financial toxicity, and 29.2% scored above the mean in financial stress. Moderate financial strain (score &gt; 21) was reported by 39.8% of participants, and approximately one-third reported loss of productivity. Transportation and nutritional supplements were the most common OOPP categories. Notably, 42% of patients spent at least 400 euros-equivalent to Romania's monthly minimum income-on transportation during radiotherapy. FT was significantly associated with employment and marital status, but not with tumor site or treatment type. Conclusions: Among Romanian HNC patients treated with curative radiotherapy, we found substantial OOPP, particularly for transportation and nutritional supplements. While overall FT levels were moderate, divorced patients and those retired due to other chronic conditions were the most vulnerable to financial distress. Financial toxicity can directly affect treatment adherence, survival, and quality of life. By integrating financial counseling, social support, and broader coverage of treatment-related expenses, healthcare systems can mitigate FT for these patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tenore G, Mohsen A, Fantozzi PJ, Golrang A, Podda GM, Rocchetti F, Borghetti L, Sansotta L, Di Gioia CRT, Romeo U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18010002'&gt;10.3390/cancers18010002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41514515/'&gt;41514515&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the malignant transformation (MT) risk profile in patients with oral proliferative leukoplakia (OPL) referred to the Oral Medicine and Oral Surgery units of Umberto I Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome. Methods: The departmental database and medical records of OPL patients were reviewed from January 2014 to June 2024. Demographic, clinical, and histopathological features and treatment strategies were collected in a de-identified dataset. Results: A total of 51 OPL patients (33 females and 18 males; mean age 62.86 ± 13.55 years) were included. MT occurred in 17.6% (n = 9) after a mean follow-up of 4.78 ± 2.59 years. A higher percentage of the presence of a previous history of solid or hematological tumor was observed in patients with MT, with an OR of 2.940 (95% CI 0.064-1.350), without statistical significance. The homogeneous clinical form was more common in patients without MT (78.57%), and the speckled clinical form was more common in patients with MT (44.44%). The percentage of patients with lesions located on the floor of the mouth, ventral surface of the tongue, and dorsal surface of the tongue was higher in patients with MT. The tongue was the most common site of MT, followed by the gingiva, buccal mucosa, and palate. At the histological level, a verrucous, nodular, or bulky architecture was more commonly observed in patients with MT, and the presence of band-like lymphocytic infiltrate was observed in all patients with MT. Higher dysplasia grades were significantly associated with MT (p = 0.009). No significant association was found between the treatment modality and MT risk, although laser ablation was associated with a trend toward lower risk. Conclusions: This study further suggests that the clinical morphology, lesion site, and histological grading may be important predicting factors for MT in OPL. The presence of a non-homogeneous lesion form, a higher grade of dysplasia, and a history of previous solid or hematological tumor led to a more aggressive disease course. Individualized risk assessment and long-term surveillance may be advisable.</description>

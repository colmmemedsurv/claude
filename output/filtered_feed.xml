      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bhalerao RV, Huppert Steed A, Kelbert J, Hintze JM, Lott DG, Jategaonkar AA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70442'&gt;10.1002/lary.70442&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41685670/'&gt;41685670&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: Laryngeal chondrosarcoma (LC) is a rare tumor accounting for less than 1% of all laryngeal cancers. While surgery is the primary treatment, national trends in management and outcomes remain poorly defined. This study aimed to analyze incidence, survival, and treatment strategies for LC using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: Patients with LC diagnosed between 2000 and 2021 were identified from SEER. Demographic, treatment, and survival data were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze survival outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 351 patients with LC were identified, representing 0.3% of all laryngeal malignancies. Among patients with treatment data, 53.3% underwent local excision or partial laryngectomy, 27.5% underwent total laryngectomy (TL), and 19.2% received no surgery. Ten-year disease-specific survival was 84.8%. Patients undergoing partial resection demonstrated significantly improved survival compared with TL (p &lt; 0.05), although this finding is likely confounded by tumor size and stage. On multivariate analysis, advanced stage (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.68-3.97), older age (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-1.99), and TL (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.88-4.62) were associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: LC remains rare but carries favorable long-term survival. National trends demonstrate a shift toward organ-preserving surgery, with partial resections increasingly favored over TL. Prognosis is most strongly influenced by age and stage, while radiation therapy appears to play a little role. These findings support organ preservation in appropriately selected patients and highlight the need for prospective studies integrating oncologic and functional outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to provide insight into practice patterns of providers who treat HPV-associated OPSCC. METHODS: A five case-vignette survey was distributed to head and neck surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists who treat head and neck cancer at NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Providers were asked to recommend management. RESULTS: Eighty-three providers completed the survey (14% response rate). Head and neck surgeons had a 60% surgical recommendation rate while medical and radiation oncologists had a 58% non-surgical recommendation rate. Radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend RT and CRT, and medical oncologists were more likely to recommend CRT over surgery compared to head and neck surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Provider specialty-specific biases influence treatment recommendations and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to head and neck cancer care.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kohl S, Schaper M, Lajarín JA, Subtil FSB, Engenhart-Cabillic R, Dikomey E, Adeberg S, Theiß U&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiation oncology (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s13014-026-02798-w'&gt;10.1186/s13014-026-02798-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41680869/'&gt;41680869&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Radiation-induced senescence strongly contributes to therapy resistance in HPV-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In particular, the NF-[Formula: see text]B-dependent arm of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) activates signaling pathways that are tightly associated with, and promote, resistance to irradiation. In addition to the SASP, another hallmark of senescence is the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. The BH3-only mimetic ABT-263 has been shown to effectively eliminate senescent cells. In this study, we employed ABT-263 to overcome the therapy-induced resistance in HNSCC cells and uncovered a link to chemokine signaling. METHODS: The HNSCC cell lines Cal33 and UPCI:SCC040 were treated with a combination of ABT-263 and photon irradiation, followed by functional and mechanistic assays assessing viability, apoptosis, senescence, secreted proteins, clonogenic survival, and DNA repair. RESULTS: Functionally, ABT-263 induced apoptosis via impeding Bcl-xL and activating Bax. Senescence levels were reduced after irradiation. Mechanistically, we observed cell-line- and protein-specific changes in the SASP, including a striking difference in CXCR2 receptor expression. Cal33 cells exhibited strong downregulation of CXCR2 and were radiosensitized by ABT-263, as indicated by reduced viability and clonogenic survival. In contrast, CXCR2 expression was induced in UPCI:SCC040 cells following treatment; although viability was diminished, clonogenic survival remained unaffected. Notably, radiosensitization in UPCI:SCC040 cells could be achieved through concomitant inhibition of CXCR2. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect was not attributable to increased DNA damage, as evidenced by γH2AX/53BP1 co-localization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a central role for CXCR2-mediated signaling in the development of radioresistance in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.</description>

Due to the rarity of salivary gland malignancies and more than 20 different histological types, there is a need to analyse clinicopathological risk factors of each histology separately, with emphasis on long-term outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study from a tertiary care centre conducted from 2014 to 2024 on all histologically confirmed MEC that underwent upfront surgery. RESULTS: 244 MEC [major salivary gland (MASG)-153, minor salivary gland (MISG)-91] were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 39 months. Location in MISG, higher T category and female sex were independent prognostic variables for survival on multivariate analysis (MVA) of the entire cohort. The impact of tumour location persisted following matched-pair analysis controlling for tumour stage, grade and margin status (OS: HR:5.3, 95% CI: 2.1 to 12.9; DFS: HR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.8). The predominant pattern of failure for tumour located in MISG was distant metastasis, whereas in MASG, loco-regional failure was commonly encountered. In terms of tumour grade, low-grade and high-grade had the best and worst outcomes for both MASG and MISG. However, survival curves for intermediate-grade tumours clustered with low-grade tumours in MASG and with high-grade tumours in MISG. CONCLUSION: Tumour location demonstrated a pronounced impact on MEC outcomes following treatment, independent of AJCC staging and histological grade.</description>

To establish a theoretical foundation for THCA immunotherapy, we investigated the association between genetic mutations and tumor microenvironment (TME) by analyzing RNA-sequencing data and somatic mutation profiles from 571 THCA samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The ESTIMATE algorithm was first applied to calculate ImmuneScores and StromalScores. Samples were subsequently stratified into immune-high and immune-low groups, as well as stromal-high and stromal-low groups, based on median score thresholds. We then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially mutated genes (DMGs). Significant disparities in mutation frequencies of BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS were observed both between immune stratification groups (high vs low) and stromal stratification groups (high vs low). Correlation analysis between DMGs and clinicopathological features revealed that BRAF/NRAS expression levels were associated with THCA clinical stage. CIBERSORT computational algorithm was also used to quantify the relative abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs), demonstrating that 11 types of activated TICs were strongly associated with BRAF expression. Finally, we examined target DMGs expression in relation to immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) to identify potential therapeutic targets. THCA specimens with suppressed BRAF expression demonstrated upregulated ICPs expression, indicating potential susceptibility to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bourdillon AT, Yao A, Bur AM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5462'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5462&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678150/'&gt;41678150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Radiomics is a field that establishes associations between quantifiable imaging biomarkers and histopathological characteristics or clinical outcomes. Radiomics holds particular promise in otolaryngology given anatomic intricacies, diverse pathologies, and many commonplace imaging modalities. Radiomics applications span diagnostic classifiers, long-term prognosticators, and predictors of treatment response. The objective of this Review was to establish methodological frameworks, identify common limitations, and evaluate the current landscape of radiomics within otolaryngology. OBSERVATIONS: Radiomics applications span the breadth of otolaryngology, with most focused on neoplasms of the upper airway, larynx, sinonasal passages, and skull base. Head and neck cancer applications include classifiers of clinically occult pathologic features (such as extranodal extension or nodal metastases) that can guide treatment options. Prognostic radiomics can reliably model recurrence and survival outcomes, with hybrid clinical radiomics models achieving superior performance compared with single-modality models. Treatment prediction through approaches like dosiomics (using radiotherapy dose distributions) and δ-radiomics (sequential imaging over time) have shown potential in improving the prediction of therapeutic response, tumor recurrence, and radiotherapy toxic effects. Beyond neoplastic classifiers, a growing body of work has sought to risk stratify or predict the evolution of rhinologic and otologic inflammatory conditions (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis, middle ear disease). Recently, there have also been radiomics applications in sleep and pediatrics. Despite these broad advances, radiomics models have several pitfalls, such as variable imaging protocols, resource-intensive manual segmentation, limited cohort sizes, and a lack of external validation, all of which hinder clinical translation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this Review suggest that radiomics is a promising tool that can be integrated with clinical and pathologic data to enhance diagnosis, optimize prognostication, and personalize treatment in otolaryngology. Standardization of imaging protocols, rigorous validation in multi-institutional cohorts, and integration with clinical workflows remain critical prerequisites for clinical application. With continued refinement and integration, radiomics applications may help streamline clinical workflows and guide treatment planning.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang SH, Cotler J, Palis B, Seethala RR, Hosni A, O'Sullivan B, Vander Poorten V, Bishop JA, Glastonbury CM, Beadle B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5396'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5396&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678147/'&gt;41678147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: A unified salivary gland carcinoma (SGC)-specific tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification can enhance prognostic accuracy, support clinical decision-making, and improve the quality of patient care. OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an SGC-specific pTNM classification with improved prognostic accuracy and optimized stage distribution for version nine of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging protocol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

This burden may be reduced through surveillance of patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Here we describe a readily accessible pilot study evaluating a database-generating approach that captures our longstanding Cancer Active Surveillance Program (CASP). Our methods can be applied to other premalignancies and disease conditions to fuel clinically relevant research related to cancer risk, disease progression, interception, and outcomes. METHODS: Electronic medical record data from the senior author's head and neck cancer practice, which harbors a significant primary screening component, was interrogated for 35 International Classification of Disease 9 and 10 codes. These codes represent over 300 unique mucosal lesion descriptors or conditions associated with heightened risk for oral cancer. These data were subject to a proof-of-concept analysis to assess geographic and racial representation in the CASP. RESULTS: Automated extraction from the electronic medical record identified 1576 individuals with OPMDs with lower cost and higher fidelity than manual chart review. CASP patients were overrepresented relative to the state population within urban centers, with underrepresentation in more rural areas. More Black patients and fewer Asian/Pacific Islander patients were seen in CASP relative to our cancer catchment's demography. CONCLUSIONS: Automated medical record queries can identify patients in the catchment area with precancerous or other at-risk conditions for cancer. IMPACT: This information informs resource utilization to improve inclusivity of underrepresented groups and streamlines identification of potential participants for cancer prevention clinical trials.</description>

Studies in various fields of medicine have shown that DC to facilities is associated with clinical outcomes. Evidence specific to HNC surgery is limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate how DC, to either home or a facility, impacts outcomes for patients undergoing HNC surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent HNC surgery between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2023 was performed. Patients were included based on postoperative hospitalization, surgical interventions, and a minimum 30-day follow-up. The primary outcomes were 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and postoperative complication severity. RESULTS: Among 1,895 patients (mean age 63 years, 67% female), 1,554 (82%) were DC home and 341 (18%) to a facility. After adjusting for significant variables, DC site was not associated with readmission (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.40), mortality (0.6% home vs 1.5% facility, p = 0.2), or complication severity (mild OR 1.3, p = 0.11; severe OR 1.0, p = 0.92). Factors such as dependency in activities of daily living, tracheotomy presence, surgery severity and prolonged hospitalization were found to be significant covariates in the multivariable analysis for both 30-day readmissions and complication severity. Facility patients had more infections or wound dehiscence (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although DC to a facility was not significantly associated with worsened outcomes in the multivariable analysis, the findings of this study revealed clinically relevant differences in complication rates and readmission.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using routinely collected primary care data Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD from the United Kingdom. Adults aged ≥ 18 years with ≥ 1 year of prior history were included. We estimated crude and age-standardised incidence rates (IRs) and one-, five-, and ten-year survival from 2000 to 2021, stratified by age and calendar year. Findings from CPRD GOLD were compared with primary care data from CPRD Aurum (England only). RESULTS: There were 12,455 patients with a diagnosis of HNC from CPRD GOLD (69.2 % male; median age 64 years). Crude incidence in GOLD increased from 9.08 (95 % CI: 7.88-10.42) per 100,000 person-years in 2000-15.59 (14.07-17.23) in 2021, with similar trends observed in CPRD Aurum. Age-standardised incidence trends were attenuated overall but remained elevated for oropharyngeal and tongue cancers. Five-year survival improved modestly, from 53.8 % (95 % CI: 51.4-56.3 %) in 2000-2004-58.7 % (56.5-60.9 %) in 2015-2019. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence increases for HNC were attenuated after age standardisation, suggesting a contribution of demographic ageing, although elevations persisted for specific subsites. Small improvements in long term survival highlights more research is needed to improve earlier diagnosis which will lead to better patient outcomes.</description>

Current guidelines recommend TSH ≥30 mIU/L, a target that prolongs hypothyroidism and worsens quality of life, yet rests on limited evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between pre-RAI TSH levels and oncologic outcomes in adults with DTC prepared by THW. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes across pre-RAI TSH thresholds (&lt;30 vs. ≥30, &lt;60 vs. ≥60, and &lt;90 vs. ≥90 mIU/L) in adults with DTC prepared by THW. Primary outcomes included disease-specific mortality, recurrence, and response to therapy. Searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus (inception to March 2025) identified eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the CLARITY tool and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020158354). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight retrospective cohort studies comprising a total of 4651 DTC patients, predominantly women (68.5%) with a mean age of 46 years. All patients underwent THW before RAI. Across all TSH thresholds examined (&lt;30, &lt;60, and &lt;90 mIU/L), higher pre-RAI TSH levels were not associated with better treatment response, lower recurrence, or reduced mortality. Specifically, patients with higher pre-RAI TSH levels (≥30 mIU/L) did not have better oncologic outcomes compared with those with lower levels (&lt;30 mIU/L). At 2- and 3-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed in excellent (pooled RR = 0.87; confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.11) or indeterminate (RR = 1.28; CI 0.72-2.27) response rates. Similarly, recurrence rates did not differ (RR = 1.45; CI 0.83-2.55), and no study demonstrated a difference in disease-specific mortality across follow-up periods extending up to 10 years. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was rated very low due to risk of bias, heterogeneity, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base is insufficient to support or refute the routine use of a specific TSH threshold before RAI administration. These findings question the recommendation to achieve TSH ≥30 mIU/L before RAI and highlight the need for trials to define the minimal effective level of TSH stimulation.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 28 institutions contributed data on 3061 patients. From this, there were 64 pediatric patients (2.1%). Clinical variables, overall and disease-free survival (OS and DFS) outcomes, and multivariable factors associated with outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 37:27 and the median [IQR] age at diagnosis was 14.0 [9.6-16.0] years. The most common malignancy was sarcoma (57.8%), followed by esthesioneuroblastoma (25.0%) and carcinoma (17.2%). Negative margins were achieved in 53.1% children. Dural invasion was associated with reduced OS and DFS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with improved survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Open approaches were widely used for pediatric skull base tumor resection in the period between 1995 and 2015 but we saw a rise in the use of endoscopic and combined techniques by the end of the period covered by this study. Our results may represent a transitional era in which alternative endoscopic techniques continue to expand.</description>

We quantified patterns of relapse relative to flaps and summarized practice, toxicity and function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: in the retrospective XFLAP1 cohort (2018-2023), patients with HNC underwent tumor resection with flap reconstruction and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) ± concurrent chemotherapy. Competing-risks (Fine-Gray) estimated locoregional relapse (LRR) and metastases; overall survival (OS) used Kaplan-Meier. Flaps were contoured a posteriori on planning CTs, when available. RESULTS: Of 355 patients across eight centres, free flaps were used in 239 (67%) and regional pedicled flaps in 69 (33%). The entire flap body was encompassed in the CTVs in 66% of plans; median flap-body dose was 65.3 Gy and pedicle Dmax 67.5 Gy for the delineated flaps (N = 153). Median follow-up was 32.9 months, 120/355 (34%) patients relapsed, including 68 (19%) LRR and 71 (20%) metastases. Median time to LRR was 7.35 months; only 3 (1%) of relapses arose within the flap body. Two-year cumulative incidence was 15.8% for LRR and 16.7% for metastases; two-year OS was 74.6%. On multivariable analysis, pN2-3 predicted metastases; LRR, metastases, and ECOG ≥ 1 were associated with worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: relapses in the flap-body epicentre were rare; most local failures involved the native tissue-flap junction or non-flap sites. These data support junction-focused CTVs with reduced emphasis of the flap body to limit morbidity, pending prospective validation.</description>

More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI -6.7-9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1-2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1-2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1-2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</description>

DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Seven hospitals in China between 18 August 2020 and 21 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-70 years with newly diagnosed high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after three cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (stage 4a, stage 2-3 with stable or progressive disease, or detectable Epstein-Barr virus DNA). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive combination chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin (standard treatment group) or standard treatment with 19 cycles of intravenous camrelizumab (200 mg) once every three weeks (radiotherapy plus two concurrent cycles and 17 adjuvant cycles; camrelizumab group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat group was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: 390 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=194) or the standard treatment group (n=196). At median follow-up of 39.9 months (interquartile range 36.8-43.4 months), progression-free survival was higher in the camrelizumab group than the standard treatment group (36 months: 83.4%, 95% confidence interval 78.3% to 88.8% v 71.3%, 65.2% to 77.9%; stratified hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77, P=0.001). The incidence of acute and late adverse events (grade 3 or 4) was 50.5% and 3.2% in the camrelizumab group compared with 48.7% and 3.7% in the standard treatment group. Immunological adverse events (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 19 patients (10.2%) in the camrelizumab group. CONCLUSION: The addition of camrelizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment improved progression-free survival among patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after induction chemotherapy.

In countries with universal healthcare such as Spain, the impact of rurality on head and neck cancer remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 1042 patients discussed at the Head and Neck Tumor Board of a tertiary hospital in Málaga, Spain (2019-2023). Demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables were collected. Rurality was defined according to Spanish legislation (population &lt; 30,000 and density &lt; 100 inhabitants/km2). Analyses included chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Rural patients had a higher prevalence of tobacco use (74.8% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.0074) and more severe smoking patterns, especially among men. Advanced-stage tumors were slightly more frequent in rural patients (64.5% vs. 60.6%) without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.6097). No associations were found between rurality and alcohol use, HPV status, or tumor site, while EBV positivity was more frequent in urban patients (p = 0.0235). CONCLUSIONS: Rural residence was associated with significantly higher tobacco use but not with advanced disease stage at diagnosis. These findings highlight rurality as a social determinant of health and support the need for targeted public health strategies to reduce cancer-related disparities in rural populations.</description>

METHODS: In this retrospective study, race/ethnicity-stratified inferential and mediation analyses assessed selected clinical outcomes for 70 581 OPSCC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. We examined the effects of Food Environment Atlas scores composited from 282-county-level variables, adjusted for the effects of traditional social determinants of health. RESULTS: Worse food environments were modestly associated with increased risk of overall mortality (aHR-1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), 3-year overall mortality (aOR-1.04, 95% CI, 1.03-1.05), and advanced stage at diagnosis (aOR-1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.03) in the whole sample, with exacerbated associations across all outcomes among non-White patients. The food environment was not significantly associated with having more than one primary tumor at diagnosis. Traditional social determinants of health partially mediated mortality, but not staging effects. CONCLUSIONS: Poor food environments were modestly associated with increased OPSCC mortality and advanced staging, with exacerbated effects in non-White patients. These retrospective findings support investigations into specific mechanisms of food environment inequity on OPSCC outcomes to guide targeted public health interventions such as subsidized transportation.</description>

This trend has raised concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) plays a pivotal role in preoperative risk stratification, yet clinical decision-making remains challenging in indeterminate categories (Bethesda III-V), particularly in resource-limited settings where molecular testing is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of malignancy (ROM) for each TBSRTC category among patients who underwent thyroid surgery over a 10-year period at a tertiary care center in India, and to compare these rates with the 2023 TBSRTC risk estimates. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed fine-needle aspiration cytology and histopathology data for all patients who underwent thyroid surgeries conducted between 2014 and 2024. ROM across TBSRTC categories was calculated and compared with established TBSRTC risk estimates. RESULTS: A 100% malignancy rate was observed in TBSRTC VI category, supporting the reliability of surgical decisions in this group. However, significantly higher malignancy rates were found in TBSRTC categories III (58.7%), IV (82.7%), and V (100%) compared to TBSRTC estimates (22%, 30%, and 74%, respectively). TBSRTC III nuclear had a significantly higher malignancy rate (70.0%) than TBSRTC III other (40.57%). CONCLUSION: Institution specific malignancy data enhances the clinical utility of TBSRTC and improves patient counseling, particularly in settings where molecular diagnostics are not feasible.</description>

We previously reported the discovery of a tumor DNA methylation signature of hypoxia (Hypoxia-M), identifying HNSCC patients at risk for local recurrence (LR), all event progression, and death after primary radiochemotherapy (RCHT). We further validate Hypoxia-M in an independent cohort of HNSCC patients who underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) METHODS: Hypoxia-M was validated in HPV-negative HNSCC patients (n = 134) homogeneously treated with PORT-C in the frame of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) multicenter biomarker trial. DNA methylation was profiled using Illumina450K technology. The performance of Hypoxia-M was integrated with previously reported biomarkers, including gene expression signatures (GES) of hypoxia, a methylome-based HPV-Independent Classifier of disease Recurrence (HICR), and immune cell score using immunohistochemistry (CD3/CD8/PD-L1/PD1). RESULTS: Hypoxia-M was independently prognostic for overall survival (OS, HR = 2.34, p = 0.03) and distant metastasis (DM, HR = 4.3, p = 0.001), but not for LR after PORT-C. Hypoxia-M remained significant after adjusting for patientś age, gender, smoking status, tumor stage, and high-risk features (ECE&amp;/R1 resection). Hypoxia-M status was inversely associated with CD8 T-cell infiltration. Patient stratification improved by integrating previously reported biomarkers, with Hypoxia-M demonstrating independent prognostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of Hypoxia-M was validated in an independent cohort. Our results highlighted a difference in recurrence patterns of hypoxic tumors treated in the primary setting (local recurrence) versus postoperatively (distant metastasis) and the utility of Hypoxia-M for identifying the main pattern of recurrence.</description>

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the antitumor immune response and type I interferon response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear and require further elucidation. In this study, we identify CD38 in NPC cells as a key mediator impairing T cell antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, CD38 induces mitochondrial autophagy through PHB2, enhances the interaction between PHB2 and MAVS, leading to the degradation of MAVS protein, and inhibits the type I interferon response and CD8+T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Importantly, CD38 promotes tumor progression and reduces the proportion of CD8+T cells and IFNγ+CD8+T cells in vivo via MAVS. In conclusion, these findings reveal previously unrecognized roles and mechanisms of CD38 in regulating anti-tumor T cell immunity, suggesting that inhibition of CD38 could initiate tumor-targeted immune responses, enhance anti-tumor immunity in patients, and provide new therapeutic strategies for NPC.</description>

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monotherapy showed lower response in OMM than other subtypes of melanoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with anlotinib in patients with advanced OMM between August 2018 and September 2024. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); the secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled in our study. Seventeen patients (41.4%) achieved an objective response. The median PFS was 6.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-8.3 months), and the median OS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.3-11.7 months). Thirty-three patients (80.5%) experienced at least one TRAE. The most common TRAEs were hypertension (29.3%), hand-foot syndrome (19.5%), and anemia (19.5%). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs occurred in two patients (4.8%), and no grade 5 TRAEs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that pembrolizumab with anlotinib in patients with advanced OMM showed potential efficacy and manageable adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this combination strategy.</description>

Recent studies have suggested that this difference persists even after accounting for smoking and alcohol use, highlighting the need to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that sex differences in HNSCC are androgen-dependent and identified androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and function. Mechanically, early growth response 4 (EGR4) functioned as a direct downstream transcriptional effector of AR that induced CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction. Clinically, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was an effective therapeutic strategy in HNSCC, suppressing tumor growth in mice while improving intratumoral CD8⁺ T cell function. Moreover, combining ADT with immune checkpoint inhibitors led to improved antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal ADT as a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the antitumor activity of sex-biased CD8⁺ T cells in HNSCC, which could inform the development of sex-biased immunotherapies for treating HNSCC patients.</description>

We evaluated the added value of fluorescently labeled tilmanocept in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of the oral cavity compared to gamma probe. METHODS: Healthy male New Zealand white rabbits received oral cavity injections of radioactive (Technetium 99m) and fluorescently (IRDye800) conjugated tilmanocept followed by either fluorescence guided (n = 14) or gamma probe guided (n = 14) SLNB performed 1 h, 48 h, or 5 days postinjection. Duration of the SLNB performed by two individuals was measured and compared using the two methods. RESULTS: Fluorescence guidance resulted in a 1.8-fold reduction in time of SLN removal (median 104 vs. 191 s, p = 0.05). For the fluorescence guided SLNB, 7.1% (1 of 14) had nonsentinel node tissue removed prior to the correct identification of the SLN, whereas gamma probe/radioactivity guided SLNB had 28.6% (4 of 14). When comparing operation time between attending and resident surgeon, time to identification of first SLN was not significantly different for fluorescence guided surgery (82 vs. 107 s, respectively) or with gamma probe (158 vs. 204 s); however, median times using the gamma probe were nearly double for both operators. We additionally show the durability of fluorescence signal up to 5 days and clear visualization of proposed tracer with commercially available intraoperative imagers. CONCLUSION: The use of fluorescent labeled tilmanocept decreases operative time needed for SLNB as well as reduces the amount of nonsentinel tissue removed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

We aim to explore the effect of tobacco cessation on the risk of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC). A case-control study was conducted across five cancer centres in India. We enrolled 2320 BMC and 2302 frequency-matched controls. Information was collected on smoking and chewing (products, duration and quitting). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of tobacco cessation compared to current users, after adjusting for potential confounders. For both smoking and chewing, the odds reduced rapidly after 5 years of quitting, so that those who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago had only 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.54) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to smoke, and those who quit chewing ≥10 years ago had 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to chew. Chewing with areca nut was associated with almost double the risk of chewing without (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.53-2.26) but the rate of reduction of risk with quitting was similar. These findings show clearly the benefits of quitting and inform policies that emphasize chewing tobacco cessation, given its widespread prevalence in India.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Singh SP, Prasad S, Dean PM, Kujur AL, Jaiswal G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41655423/'&gt;41655423&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Extranodal extension (ENE) of cervical lymph node metastases is a key prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the survival impact of ENE in HNSCC and identified global research trends relevant to this research field through a complementary bibliometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus were systematically searched during 2000-2025. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Biblioshiny package of R to identify and map the publication trends, influential authors, and major institutional contributions between 2010 and 2025. RESULTS: Of the 839 retrieved records, 711 studies were screened, and 16 studies comprising approximately 3900 patients met all inclusion criteria. The bibliometric analysis of 120 Scopus-indexed publications demonstrated a marked increase in ENE-related research from 2015 onward, driven primarily by institutions in Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea. Keyword mapping indicated expanding intersections of ENE research with radiomics, prognostic modelling, and refinement of staging systems. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant association between ENE and adverse survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed consistently poor prognostic implications across both pathologic and radiologic ENE assessments. CONCLUSION: ENE in cervical lymph node metastases is an independent and strong predictor of adverse survival in HNSCC. The increasing global attention to ENE highlights its crucial role in multidisciplinary oncologic management. Therefore, standardized pathological and imaging-based assessment of ENE is essential for developing superior prognostic models and optimizing future treatment planning strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rühle A, Subramani R, Su J, O'Sullivan B, Waldron JN, Hope A, Bayley A, McPartlin A, Malik N, Bratman SV, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70424'&gt;10.1002/lary.70424&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41654325/'&gt;41654325&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic importance of impaired vocal cord mobility (VCM) in T2N0 glottic cancer. METHODS: All patients with T2N0 glottic cancer treated with partial laryngeal IMRT in 2009-2021 in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. For comparison, cohorts with T1N0 and T3N0 disease were also included. Locoregional failure (LRF), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared among T1N0, T2N0 with normal VCM (T2-Normal-VCM), T2N0 with impaired VCM (T2-Impaired-VCM), and T3N0 groups. Multivariable analysis (MVA) assessed the prognostic value of VCM within the T2N0 group. RESULTS: A total of 642 cases were included: 288 T1N0, 224 T2N0 (147 T2-Normal-VCM, 77 T2-Impaired-VCM), and 130 T3N0. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (IQR 3.4-6.2). Five-year LRF for T1N0, T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 were 4% (95% CI 2-6), 9% (5-15), 27% (17-38), and 35% (27-44), respectively. Corresponding DFS was 83% (78-88), 80% (73-87), 55% (45-68), and 50% (41-60), while OS was 85% (80-90), 86% (80-92), 71% (61-83), and 59% (50-69), respectively. In T2N0, MVA confirmed that impaired VCM was associated with higher LRF (aHR 3.72 [95% CI 1.79-7.71], p &lt; 0.001), lower DFS (aHR 2.74 [1.68-4.45], p &lt; 0.001), and lower OS (aHR 2.07 [1.17-3.67], p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary cohort, LRF rates increased stepwise from T1N0 to T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 glottic cancer. Within T2N0 disease, impaired VCM is an adverse prognostic factor, supporting subdivision into T2a (normal VCM) and T2b (impaired VCM) in future TNM revisions. Prospective studies are warranted to assess whether treatment intensification can improve outcomes for T2-Impaired-VCM disease.</description>

WDTC is biologically heterogeneous, with generally favorable prognosis but substantial variability in clinical behavior. Advances in molecular imaging, artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostics, and liquid biopsy have altered diagnostic strategies, while targeted therapy and immunotherapy have expanded treatment options for selected patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) model has therefore become an essential component of WDTC management through the integration of expertise from multiple specialties. METHODS: This review examines the role of MDT application in WDTC through analysis of relevant literature and international clinical guidelines, focusing on MDT composition, implementation models, clinical roles across diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, and current limitations. Differences in MDT recommendations among guidelines from various regions were also compared. RESULTS: MDT involvement supports personalized decision-making in WDTC, particularly in cases with indeterminate diagnosis, risk-adapted treatment selection, recurrent disease, and radioiodine-refractory progression. Persistent challenges include overtreatment of low-risk disease, suboptimal management of high-risk cases, limited MDT implementation in primary hospitals, uneven specialty participation, and variability in decision-making within guideline gray zones. CONCLUSION: The MDT model provides a structured framework to improve risk-adapted management of WDTC. Future efforts should prioritize refined risk-stratified MDT models, integration of decision-support tools, and expansion of remote platforms to enhance consistency and quality of management.</description>

BNCT produces high linear energy transfer particles with micrometer-range energy deposition, enabling cell-selective irradiation confined to boron-enriched tumor cells in a geometrically targeted region by the neutron beam. This mechanism offers the potential for exceptionally high therapeutic ratios, provided two core requirements are met: sufficient differential tumor uptake of 10B and a neutron beam with appropriate energy and penetration. After early clinical attempts in the mid-20th century were hindered by inadequate boron agents and reactor-based neutron beams, recent technological breakthroughs have made BNCT clinically viable. The development of hospital-compatible accelerator neutron sources, next-generation boron delivery systems (such as receptor-targeted compounds and nanoparticles), advanced theranostic approaches (such as 18F-BPA positron emission tomography and boron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging), and AI-driven biodistribution modeling now support personalized treatment planning and patient selection. These innovations have catalyzed modern clinical implementation, exemplified by Japan's regulatory approval of BNCT for recurrent head and neck cancer and the rapid expansion of clinical programs across Asia, Europe, and South America. Building on these foundations, BNCT has transitioned from a predominantly academic experimental modality into an increasingly commercialized and industrially supported therapeutic platform. The emergence of dedicated BNCT companies, international collaborations between accelerator manufacturers and hospitals, and pharmaceutical development pipelines for next-generation boron carriers has accelerated clinical translation. Moreover, BNCT now occupies a unique position among radiation modalities due to its hybrid nature, namely combining the biological targeting of radiopharmaceutical therapy with the external-beam controllability of radiotherapy, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities where competitive approaches fall short. Emerging evidence suggests therapeutic promise in glioblastoma, recurrent head and neck cancers, melanoma, meningioma, lung cancer, sarcomas, and other difficult-to-treat malignancies. Looking ahead, continued innovation in compact neutron source engineering, boron nanocarriers, multimodal theranostics, microdosimetry-guided treatment planning, and combination strategies with systemic therapies such as immunotherapy will be essential for optimizing outcomes. Together, these converging developments position BNCT as a biologically targeted and potentially transformative modality in the era of precision oncology.</description>

Despite a wide range of treatment options, it remains a challenge to identify which ones are the most effective for which groups of patients. One solution is to analyse selected biomarkers. In this paper, biomarkers are divided into distinctive groups according to the molecular pathways analysed or specific molecules within the cell or in tissue fluids. The paper provides a description of these groups, including genetic and apoptosis-associated factors, factors regulating angiogenesis, cell structure regulators, immune factors in the form of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1), hormone receptors, molecules involved in growth factor pathways, and cell cycle regulators. Representative examples are discussed for each of these groups, indicating their potential usefulness in staging, assessing tumour aggressiveness, and making a prognosis.</description>

Many studies fail to investigate the biological drivers behind survival disparities, especially sex-specific differences within racial groups. This study serves as a foundational project to begin elucidating biological differences in the tumor microenvironment between male and female African American HNSCC patients. Methods: A total of 111 patients who were diagnosed with HNSCC and identify as African American were grouped by sex. Analyses of socioeconomic status, co-morbidities, tumor characteristics, and treatment were conducted. Spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed on four randomly selected primary HNSCC tumor tissues. Results: No sex-based differences were observed in socioeconomic measures, treatments, tumor stage, follow-up, recurrence, or cause of death (all p &gt; 0.15), though females had higher median income than males (p = 0.035). Comorbidity profiles were also largely comparable between males and females. Evaluating tumor microenvironments, we found that male tumors were dominated by malignant cells and fibroblasts, with limited adaptive immune infiltration. By contrast, female tumors displayed markedly higher proportions of immune cells, including T cells and B cells. Male tumors harbored sparse T cells, largely skewed toward exhausted phenotypes while female tumors displayed abundant T cell infiltration consistent with immunologically active tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: Clinical and demographic factors showed minimal sex-based differences among African American HNSCC patients, spatial transcriptomic profiling revealed strikingly distinct immune microenvironments by sex. These findings suggest that biological, rather than simply clinical, differences may drive survival disparities. This project serves as a novel and foundational study promoting the use of spatial transcriptomics to evaluate possible survival disparities within HNSCC populations to alleviate survival disparities.</description>

The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody cemiplimab has transformed the outcome of advanced or metastatic cSCC, with response rates approaching 50% and sustained benefit beyond three years in clinical trials. Cemiplimab is now the first-line standard of care treatment for advanced disease. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included consecutive adult patients with locally advanced (lac) or metastatic (m) cSCC who received cemiplimab (350 mg every three weeks) at the Center for Immuno-Oncology, University Hospital of Siena, Italy, either through an Expanded Access Program or routine clinical practice. Clinical outcome and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) are reported. RESULTS: Between December 2019 and December 2023, 27 patients (24 male; median age 82 years [range 41-90]) diagnosed with lacSCC (n = 20 [74.0%]) or mcSCC (n = 7 [25.9%]) were treated with cemiplimab as first line therapy and were followed until June 2024. Head and neck were the primary tumor location for 88.8% of patients, followed by trunk (7.4%) and lower extremities (3.7%). All patients had comorbidities, including six patients (22.2%) with hematologic malignancies. With a median follow-up of 31 months (data cut-off June 2024), the ORR was 66.6% (complete response 22.2%) and the disease control rate (DCR) 77.7%. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) were not reached, while 2-year PFS and OS rates were 65.2% and 71%, respectively. Treatment was well-tolerated, with three (11.1%) patients experiencing grade ≥3 TRAEs, and three patients discontinuing treatment due to TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our real-world experience confirms the high rate of durable objective responses, good tolerability and long treatment duration of cemiplimab in elderly and frail cSCC patients as well.</description>

Although ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (USgFNAB) is widely used as a minimally invasive diagnostic tool, its sensitivity for detecting occult metastases remains limited. Current preoperative staging modalities are further constrained by operator dependency and suboptimal specificity in early-stage disease. Integration of molecular diagnostics, particularly the analysis of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), represents a promising strategy to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Objective: This review synthesizes the current evidence on lncRNA expression profiles in HNSCC, with an emphasis on their association with lymph node metastasis and potential application in FNAB-derived material for pre-treatment staging. Methods: A structured literature search was conducted, focusing on studies evaluating lncRNA expression profiles in HNSCC and their relevance to lymph node metastasis, with a particular focus on the feasibility of analysis of USgFNAB samples. Results: Multiple lncRNAs, including HOTAIR, MALAT1, UCA1, TUG1, AFAP1-AS1, H19, MEG3, and ADAMTS9-AS2, have been implicated in metastatic progression through their involvement in diverse mechanisms such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, chromatin remodeling, angiogenesis, and pre-metastatic niche formation. Elevated expression of several of these transcripts correlates with adverse clinicopathological features, including advanced tumor stage, extranodal extension, and reduced survival. However, no studies have profiled lncRNA expression in matched primary tumors and metastatic lymph nodes, and transcriptomic analysis of FNAB samples remains largely unexplored in HNSCC. Conclusions: lncRNAs represent promising molecular biomarkers for enhancing the sensitivity and specificity of USgFNAB in detecting occult cervical metastases. Future research should prioritize paired tumor-node lncRNA profiling, validation of FNAB-based molecular assays, and integration of multi-omics data for predictive modeling. Overall, integrating lncRNA analysis into ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy may enhance the detection of occult nodal metastases in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and support more accurate nodal staging in clinically node-negative patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sang Y, Dang J, Wu J, Wu Y, Quan E, Dai J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18030426'&gt;10.3390/cancers18030426&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41681898/'&gt;41681898&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background and Purpose: Based on the distortion of the current conformity index (CI) formula in handling multi-target plans, the VTV parameter in the current CI formula has been redefined to more accurately calculate the CI value of multi-target plans, providing a reference for clinical applications. Methods and Materials: Considering the limitations of the current VTV calculation formula in CI proposed by van't Riet and Paddick, a new VTV has been defined to better reflect the true conformity of the target volume in multi-target planning. We selected 15 breast cancer (BC) plans with PTVsc and PTVcw as the target volumes, and 15 nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) plans with PTVp, PTVn, PTVrpn, PTV1, and PTV2 as target volumes. VTVnew and CInew were calculated using the proposed formulas, while VTVold and CIold were calculated using traditional formulas based on van't Riet and Paddick. A paired, two-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to compare VTVnew with VTVold, and CInew with CIold across all target volumes. Pearson's correlation analysis was performed between CInew and CIold. Results: For BC, the VTV values calculated by the two methods for PTVsc and PTVcw showed statistically significant differences; the values calculated in this study were significantly lower than those calculated by van't Riet and Paddick (p &lt; 0.05). Consequently, the CInew values for BC were significantly higher than CIold. These results were consistent with those for PTVp, PTVn, PTVrpn, and PTV2 in NPC. For PTV1 in NPC, the results calculated by the two formulas were identical. Conclusions: The new VTV calculation formula eliminates the influence of dose spillage from adjacent targets, retaining only the prescription dose range of the specific target under analysis. This makes the calculated CI more reflective of true conformity compared to traditional formulas. We recommend using the proposed formula to calculate CI values for multi-target plans such as those for BC and NPC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xu D, Chen B, Shen Y, Deng G, Li P, Cai J, Chen J, Bai J, Tian Y, Xiao M, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18030422'&gt;10.3390/cancers18030422&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41681894/'&gt;41681894&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Metastasis and recurrence account for the failure of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) treatment. Growing evidence indicates the dominant roles of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumor progression and therapy resistance. However, the heterogeneity of CSCs and potential stemness-related markers in NPC patients are still largely unknown. METHODS: Consensus clustering was first applied to identify robust stemness subtypes for NPC patients based on the activities of stem cell gene sets. The differences in clinical outcomes, tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), and drug response were compared between subtypes. The stemness-related markers were prioritized via weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and Cox regression, and verified through in vitro experiments. RESULTS: NPC patients were classified into C1 and C2 subtypes. The C2 subtype exhibited higher activities of stem cell gene sets, worse prognosis, and aggressive tumor progression thus defined as stem cell-like tumor phenotype. The exclusionary relationships between tumor stemness and TIME infiltration were observed. The efficacy of several drugs and immunotherapy varied between NPC stemness subtypes. Through the WGCNA and survival analysis, we found that PSMC3IP, NABP2, CDC45, and HJURP were stemness-relevant genes. Sphere formation assays and analysis of the protein expression of stem cell markers by Western blotting revealed the roles of PSMC3IP, NABP2, CDC45, and HJURP in promoting CSC properties. Moreover, these genes were found to be related to the therapeutic effect of telomerase inhibitor in CCK8 experiments. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically characterized two NPC subtypes with distinct stemness features, clinical outcomes, and TIME features. Novel stemness-related markers will provide valuable targets against metastatic or recurrent NPC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dragan T, Chiairi I, Salmon M, Lalami Y, Digonnet A, Lipski S, Van Gestel D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2026.1724193'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2026.1724193&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41675289/'&gt;41675289&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is rare in non-endemic regions but poses unique clinical challenges, especially among ethnically diverse populations. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics, treatment outcomes, and toxicity profiles of NPC patients treated with definitive intensity-modulated radio-chemotherapy (IMRT-CRT) in a non-endemic European center. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 82 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed NPC treated at Institut Jules Bordet between 2012 and 2024. Patient, tumor, treatment characteristics, survival outcomes, and treatment-related toxicity were evaluated. Survival endpoints were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 35 months. Most patients were male (77%), of North African descent (66%), and had non-keratinizing carcinoma (96%). Advanced disease (stage III/IV) was present in 72%, and 78% of tested tumors were EBV-positive. Induction chemotherapy (ICT) and concurrent chemotherapy (CCT) were administered in 32% of patients. At 5 years, actuarial estimates for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional disease-free survival (LRDFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and distant disease-free survival (DFS) were 73%, 79%, 86%, 87%, and 87%, respectively. Higher T stage, treatment-related weight loss, positive nodal findings on 3-month FDG-PET-CT, and disease recurrence were associated with worse OS. Acute and late toxicities were generally manageable; however, xerostomia, hypothyroidism, ototoxicity, and weight loss were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being conducted in a non-endemic region, this study revealed NPC characteristics and outcomes resembling those in endemic populations, likely due to patient demographics. Early metabolic response and nutritional status emerged as critical prognostic factors, highlighting the need for individualized treatment and supportive care strategies in NPC management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu J, Takahashi Y, Rehman U, Turri-Zanoni M, Mattavelli D, Counsell N, Ferrari M, Rampinelli V, Vermi W, Lombardi D, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18030366'&gt;10.3390/cancers18030366&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41681839/'&gt;41681839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is an extremely rare, high-grade, and aggressive tumor of the sinonasal tract. Due to the rarity of this malignancy, current treatment guidelines are based on small and often/mainly single-center retrospective datasets. In the absence of a universally accepted standard of care for SNUC, treatment approaches vary across countries and institutions, reflecting real-world clinical practice. The primary aim of this study was to describe real-world treatment and outcomes for patients with confirmed SNUC. Methods: This was an international, multi-center, retrospective, observational cohort study that pooled patients into the largest SNUC dataset to date. Fifteen centers were enrolled to contribute data, including seven from Europe, four from the United States, three from the United Kingdom, and one from Canada. In the absence of a universally accepted standard of care for SNUC, treatment approaches varied across countries and institutions, reflecting real-world clinical practice. Patients included were those with histologically confirmed SNUC who were treated between 1997 and 2021. Results: This study yielded 485 patients treated for SNUC. The median age at diagnosis was 55.6 years (IQR: 44.5-67.6), and 63.7% were male. Most cases presented at advanced stages, with 70.8% as T4a or T4b. Overall survival (OS) outcomes were available for 412 patients, with a median follow-up of 26.0 months. The 5- and 10-year OS were 47.2% (95% CI: 40.8-53.3%) and 39.6% (95% CI: 32.5-46.6%), respectively. Advanced age, dichotomized T-stage (T4a/b vs. T1-3), M-stage, and orbital involvement were significant poor prognostic factors on univariable analysis (p's &lt; 0.01). On multivariable analysis, orbital involvement (HR: 2.73, 95% CI: 1.42-5.27, p = 0.003) and distance metastasis stage (HR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.25-7.21, p = 0.014) were both independently associated with worse OS. Conclusions: This observational study presents the largest multi-center cohort analysis of SNUC to date, providing new insights into prognostic factors for a rare cancer treated at global centers of excellence. Orbital involvement and the presence of metastases are candidate independent risk factors associated with poorer OS.</description>

This study aimed to compare the 5-year survival rate and Quality of Life (QoL) between S+R and SSIACRT for locally advanced oral cavity cancer. METHODS: From a total of 326 patients with stage III and IV oral cavity cancer treated between 2000-2020 at a single institution, 149 patients treated with S+R and SSIACRT were analyzed by using Propensity Score Matching (PSM) method, a pseudo-randomized controlled trial, and the matched cases were retrospectively evaluated. The 5-year survival rate and QoL were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the University of Washington QoL questionnaire, respectively. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards model were used to compare 5-year survival rate and to assess factors affecting survival rates, respectively. Paired t-test was used to compare QoL. RESULTS: To compare the 5-year survival rate and QoL between S+R and SSIACRT, 48 and 15 cases were matched after PSM. The 149 cases were further evaluated for covariates affecting survival rates. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate and 5-year crude survival rate were 52.4% and 44.3% for S+R and 71.3%, and 62.9% for SSIACRT, respectively. There was no statistical difference in survival rates between both treatments, based on Log-rank test analysis. Treatment method was the only independent variable that influenced survival rates. SSIACRT showed better statistical difference in QoL evaluation, specifically in appearance, activity, recreation, swallowing, speech, shoulder, taste, mood, and total score. CONCLUSIONS: Propensity score-matched analysis demonstrated survival outcomes that were comparable to, and not inferior to, S+R. However, SSIACRT was associated with superior quality-of-life outcomes compared with S+R, as shown by Cox proportional hazards modeling. These findings suggest that SSIACRT is an effective treatment option and, from a quality-of-life perspective, may be considered a preferable approach in the management of locally advanced oral cavity cancer.</description>

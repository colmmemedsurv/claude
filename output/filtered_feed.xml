      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Scussiatto HO, Patel EA, Stenson KM, Al-Khudari S, Jelinek MJ, Joshi N, Stubbs VC, Pinto JM, Bhayani MK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70128'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41553005/'&gt;41553005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Heavy metals are established human carcinogens, and lead exposure via drinking water has been linked to esophageal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association between various levels of lead exposure in drinking water and incidence rates of head and neck cancers (HNC) in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. SETTING: County-level data from 608 US counties included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: County-level HNC incidence rates and sociodemographic variables were obtained from SEER. Drinking water lead concentrations were sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW). Tobacco and alcohol use data were retrieved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flexible semi-parametric regression models were used to assess the association between lead exposure and HNC incidence, adjusting for known confounders. Multiple comparisons were addressed using Holm's method, and sensitivity analyses were performed using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. RESULTS: Higher lead concentrations were significantly associated with increased incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancers (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P &lt; .01), gum and mouth cancers (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P = .02), and esophageal neoplasms (IRR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, P = .02). These associations remained significant after multiple testing correction and were consistent across OLS models. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that even low-level lead exposure below EPA limits in drinking water is associated with increased incidence of specific HNC subsites. These findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into environmental determinants of HNC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Duhon BH, Sun X, Hernandez M, Lewis CM, Nader ME, Gidley PW&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70119'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70119&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41553004/'&gt;41553004&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Advanced temporal bone and parotid gland malignancies are rare and difficult to manage. However, complications of oncologic temporal bone surgery have not been systematically categorized. We aim to detail the postoperative outcomes of lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) and mastoidectomy for otologic oncology patients, and secondarily, to identify preoperative risk factors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Patients with temporal bone or parotid gland malignancies treated with LTBR or mastoidectomy at our institution. Demographic, clinical, and 30-day postoperative data was extracted from a head and neck-specific (HNS) NSQIP database. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four patients underwent LTBR (n = 121) or mastoidectomy (n = 53). Reconstruction was performed in 98%, with 94% being free flaps. Half experienced at least one postoperative occurrence (n = 59/121, LTBR; n = 27/53 mastoidectomy). The most common was anemia requiring blood transfusion (n = 47/174), with nearly double the incidence in LTBR versus mastoidectomy (32.2% vs 15.1%, P = .019). LTBR patients had longer length of stay (mean 7.6 vs 5.5 days), while mastoidectomy had higher rates of facial nerve injury (5.7% vs 1.7%, P &gt; .05). On multivariable analysis, patients with increased age (per decade) (P = .012), higher stage tumors (T3/T4) (P = .048) and lengthy operative time (&gt;13 hours) (P = .015) had significantly increased risk of developing an HNS-NSQIP occurrence. CONCLUSION: LTBR and mastoidectomy, alongside their reconstruction, are associated with relatively high rates for anemia requiring blood transfusion, new-onset facial paralysis, and extended length of stay. When performing risk assessment and mitigation, age, tumor stage, and operative time should be considered.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kang S, Bai H, Liu H, Wang Y, Hu X, Xu H, Wang A, Lyu Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70172'&gt;10.1002/hed.70172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41550062/'&gt;41550062&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has excluded minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) from the T3 category. However, mETE remains classified as an intermediate-risk feature for recurrence in thyroid cancer. The prognostic significance of mETE and its association with recurrence risk remain subjects of ongoing debate. METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1870 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) with central lymph node dissection (CLND) between 2015 and 2020. Cox proportional hazards regression models and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the association of mETE with structural recurrence. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.9 months, 124 patients (6.6%) experienced structural recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with mETE than in those without (11.0% vs. 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that mETE was an independent risk factor, particularly in patients with bilateral tumors (HR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.8-4.95) and those without Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.53-3.63). A significant interaction between tumor bilaterality and mETE was observed (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PTC, mETE is a significant prognostic factor of structural recurrence and is associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS). Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that mETE elevates recurrence risk to near the ATA intermediate-high threshold (17.6%) in bilateral PTC, regardless of tumor size. This synergy of mETE and bilaterality supports upgrading risk stratification and intensifying surveillance for this subset.</description>

Although imaging techniques have advanced, occult metastases are present in approximately 20-30% of patients with early-stage oral cancer and clinically negative necks. OBJECTIVE: This review examines current evidence on optimal strategies for managing the N0 neck in oral cancer patients. METHODS: We discuss diagnostic modalities for detecting occult metastases, including clinical examination, conventional imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), functional imaging (positron emission tomography), and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The review evaluates the main management approaches---elective neck dissection, watchful waiting, and sentinel lymph node biopsy---analyzing current evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. RESULTS: We examine patient and tumor factors that influence decision-making, including tumor thickness, location, differentiation, and pattern of invasion. Special considerations for specific subsites and clinical scenarios are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we explore emerging technologies and future directions in the management of the N0 neck, including molecular biomarkers, liquid biopsy techniques, and personalized approaches to treatment. This review provides evidence-based recommendations to support clinical decision-making for managing patients with oral cancer and clinically negative necks.</description>

METHODS: Sex, age, staging, year, and Federative Unit of diagnosis were evaluated for all cases registered under the ICD-C02 code in a public nationwide database. Statistics encompassed the Dickey-Fuller and Mann-Kendall tests, Kendall's Tau coefficient, and Sen's Slope Estimator. RESULTS: The registry of OTSCC increased from 2013 to 2023, with a stronger and more consistent trend in young adults. OTSCC showed a stronger, more consistent, and higher rate of increase in young females than in young males. OTSCC was diagnosed at advanced stages in both age groups. OTSCC increasing trends were pronounced in the North region. CONCLUSION: This study presented an overview of the temporal trends of OTSCC in Brazil, evidencing an increase among young women.</description>

Yet most computational tools highlight common cell types and overlook rare populations that can drive disease. Here we show GARDEN, a computational framework that identifies and characterizes these pathogenic cells or regions in spatial omics by embedding graph-based dynamic attention into a spatially-aware graph fusion contrastive model. GARDEN works consistently across tissues, species and resolution scales, and aligns consecutive sections to reconstruct 3D anatomy. In an Alzheimer's disease model, GARDEN localizes C1qa/C1qb-marked microglia in amyloid-β regions and reveals key immune pathways. In nasopharyngeal carcinoma it identifies tiny tertiary lymphoid structures, and in breast cancer it uncovers inflammatory M1-like macrophages near ductal carcinoma in situ and links them to pro-metastatic signaling. An interpretation module pinpoints key immune signatures, and GARDEN extends to spatial chromatin accessibility, providing insight into epigenetic regulation and informing diagnostics and therapeutic targeting.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lima EDNS, Ferreira IB, de Paiva Maia YC, Pena GDG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15373-5'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15373-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41545962/'&gt;41545962&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a recognized risk factor for reduced survival in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). However, evidence remains limited regarding whether, and to what extent, pre-treatment nutritional parameters contribute to local recurrence and metastasis. So, the aim was to estimate the association between pre-treatment nutritional parameters and these outcomes such as mortality, local recurrence, and metastasis over a five-year follow-up in patients with HNC, and to assess the prognostic validity of the nutritional parameters. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted with 84 HNC patients treated at a reference outpatient clinic, followed for up to five years after treatment initiation. Nutritional status was assessed using the Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA), Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM), and the ESPEN criteria, as well as the Weight Loss Grading System (WLGS), and the presence of cachexia. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the associations between pre-treatment nutritional parameters and clinical outcomes. The sensitivity and specificity of these parameters were also estimated to determine their predictive potential. RESULTS: High rates of mortality (76.2%), local recurrence (31.1%), and metastasis (38.1%) were observed. At the beginning of the study, most patients were at nutritional risk (34.5% PG-SGA score ≥ 10 to &lt; 16, and 36.9% PG-SGA score ≥ 16), 27.4 to 67.9% were malnourished depending on the diagnostic criteria, and 47.6% presented with cachexia. All nutritional parameters, except WLGS and ESPEN criteria, were associated with higher mortality and shorter survival. The PG-SGA score was the only parameter associated with local recurrence, while cachexia, nutritional risk, and malnutrition according to PG-SGA were associated with metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-treatment nutritional risk, malnutrition (by GLIM and PG-SGA), and cachexia were associated with mortality, which was also associated with metastasis. Notably, nutritional risk (PG-SGA score &gt; 16) was the only parameter associated with all three outcomes. From a clinical perspective, we suggest that combining PG-SGA and cachexia assessment may enhance prediction of mortality and metastasis in HNC patients, respectively.</description>

This study aimed to define a histology-driven molecular profiling (MP) algorithm for SGCs to optimize testing strategies and support therapeutic decision-making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all SGC patients who underwent MP (2016-2023) for gene rearrangements and pathogenic/likely pathogenic DNA variants (P-LPV). We considered adenoid cystic carcinomas (AdCCs) versus non-AdCCs, the latter as low aggression (LA) or high aggression (HA). MP included DNA/RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) ± fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were used for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, and IHC for androgen receptor (AR) status. FISH, NGS and/or IHC were used for neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) detection. RESULTS: Among a total of 253 SGCs, AdCCs (132/253, 52%) had MYB/MYBL1 fusions in 47% of cases, all lacking P-LPV. Among HA non-AdCCs (84/253, 33%), P-LPV were found in 55% of cases, including TP53 (34%), PIK3CA (18%), HRAS (14%) and PTEN (5%), in the absence of gene fusions. We found P-LPV in 50% of LA non-AdCCs (37/253, 15%), with ETV6-NTRK3 fusion in one secretory carcinoma. HER2 analysis identified HER2 positivity in 23% of cases (all HA non-AdCC), with 36% HER2-low and 41% HER2-negative. We found less P-LPV in HER2-positive (17.6%) versus HER2-low (67%) or HER2-negative (64%), regardless of AR status. MP-guided therapy was delivered in 4% of cases. Based on our results, we propose a stepwise, histology-driven MP algorithm for SGCs. In AdCCs, we recommend initial FISH for MYB/MYBL1 fusions: fusion-positive cases typically lack other P-LPV, sparing further MP. In fusion-negative cases, DNA NGS can be considered. In HA non-AdCCs, HER2 and AR should be tested upfront, proceeding with DNA NGS in HER2-low/negative tumors. In LA non-AdCCs, we recommend ETV6-NTRK3 FISH followed by DNA/RNA NGS in fusion-negative cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the clinical implementation of a tailored, histology-driven MP algorithm, potentially optimizing the genomic testing resources in SGCs.</description>

Ultrasonography (US) offers high accuracy for shallow tumors, whereas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides superior visualization of deeper structures. However, each modality has limitations. This retrospective, exploratory study aimed to investigate a combined strategy leveraging the complementary strengths of both modalities to improve preoperative CLNM prediction. The study included 46 patients with TSCC who underwent radical surgery between September 2014 and August 2019. Correlations between US-derived DOI (usDOI), MRI-derived DOI (mrDOI), and pathological DOI (pDOI) were assessed using Pearson's product-moment correlation. Agreement was evaluated by Bland-Altman analysis. A grid search approach identified the optimal usDOI threshold for switching to mrDOI, and predictive performance for CLNM was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with the area under the curve (AUC). Both usDOI and mrDOI showed strong correlations with pDOI (r = 0.956 and r = 0.958, respectively). However, usDOI demonstrated smaller measurement bias (mean difference: 0.88 mm) compared to mrDOI (2.43 mm). Bland-Altman plots revealed that usDOI tended to underestimate pDOI when the mean DOI exceeded 10 mm. Grid search analysis determined an optimal threshold of 7 mm for switching from US to MRI measurements. The combined DOI strategy -using usDOI for DOI ≤ 7 mm and mrDOI for DOI &gt; 7 mm- yielded a numerically higher AUC (0.694) compared to either modality alone (usDOI: AUC = 0.682; mrDOI: AUC = 0.673). This study demonstrates the potential value of a conditional imaging strategy that applies US for shallow lesions and MRI for deeper ones. By capitalizing on the strengths of each modality, this approach offers a logical framework for improving the accuracy of preoperative CLNM prediction in TSCC. Larger, prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings.</description>

Therefore, we compared real-world survival and molecular/transcriptional signatures in patients with BRAF-mut and BRAF-wildtype (wt) PTC. METHODS: Thyroid tumor samples underwent DNA/RNA next-gen sequencing and immunohistochemistry at Caris Life Sciences. Tumor microenvironment (TME) cell fractions were estimated by RNA deconvolution using QuanTIseq. Insurance claims data was used to infer real-world overall survival (OS) and time on treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1348 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were identified; 81.8% were classified as PTC, of which 68.4% harbored a BRAF-V600E mutation. TERT promoter mutations were the most common mutation in PTC (72%), and more prevalent in BRAF-mut versus (vs) BRAF-wt. Mutations in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS, as well as RET, BRAF, and ETV6 gene fusions, were predominantly found in BRAF-wt PTC. BRAF-mut PTC were more often PD-L1+ (33% vs. 18%, p&lt;0.001) and had significantly higher IFNγ scores. OS was not significantly different between patients with BRAF-mut vs wt PTC. Systemic treatment (BRAF/MEKi, TKI or IO) was not associated with significant differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC, although there was a trend for longer OS in those treated with TKI compared to BRAF/MEKi or IO. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF-mut PTC is associated with a pro-inflammatory TME milieu compared to BRAF-wt PTC. However, in this limited data set, treatment choice was not associated with differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive liquid biopsy tool to stratify patient risk preoperatively. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study evaluating preoperative CTC levels in 210 patients diagnosed with PTC. A dual-threshold model was developed to analyze the diagnostic performance of CTC counts. The study particularly focused on the Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) subgroup (n=100) to address clinical uncertainty regarding active surveillance versus definitive therapy. Patients were monitored over a median follow-up period of 44 months to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and long-term prognostic outcomes. RESULTS: The dual-threshold model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff of ≥ 2 CTCs effectively identified high-risk patients with 93.2% specificity and 88.2% positive predictive value (PPV). In the PTMC cohort, a CTC count &lt; 2 reliably identified low-risk patients suitable for active surveillance (NPV=94.0%), while a count ≥ 2 pinpointed those with high-risk features warranting surgery (Specificity=96.4%, PPV=80.0%). Prognostic analysis revealed that CTC-negative patients had improved PFS. This was most significant in the PTMC subgroup, where the CTC-negative cohort remained recurrence-free and showed significantly longer PFS compared to CTC-positive cases (HR=0.035, 95% CI: 0.002-0.726; P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CTC detection enables precise risk stratification for PTC patients. This liquid biopsy approach allows clinicians to personalize therapy-confidently selecting conservative management for low-risk individuals and recommending aggressive treatment for high-risk patients-thereby optimizing clinical decision-making and long-term outcomes.</description>

This study explored the efficacy and safety of toripalimab in combination with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) for the treatment of rNPC. METHODS: This single-arm, Phase 2 trial included patients with rNPC who met the inclusion criteria as confirmed by pathology or imaging. The patients received toripalimab combined with CCRT. The primary end point was the objective response rate (ORR) of the patients. Secondary end points included disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety profile. RESULTS: Between April 2020 and September 2023, 40 patients with rNPC were recruited. The best response of ORR after radiotherapy was 87.5% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 72.0-95.0), with a DCR of 100%. The median PFS for rNPC was 18.1 months (95% CI, 15.2-28.8). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year PFS rates were 68.2%, 41.3%, and 15.5%, respectively. The median OS for rNPC was 28.3 months (95% CI, 18.6-Not Available [NA]). The 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year OS rates were 69.7%, 53.9%, 44.8%. The most common acute toxicities were hematological toxicities, including lymphopenia (100%) and anemia (92.5%), whereas the most common late toxicities were dry mouth (60.0%) and nasopharyngeal wall necrosis (40.0%). Fatal epistaxis was the cause of death in 22.5% of patients. CONCLUSION: Toripalimab plus CCRT demonstrates antitumor efficacy in rNPC. The observed 22.5% rate of fatal epistaxis indicates that its potential benefits must be carefully weighed against this serious treatment-related risk.</description>

METHODS: A prospective population-based screening study was conducted in Southern China from October 2014 to November 2018 among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals aged 30-69 years. EBV-seropositive participants underwent both endoscopy and MRI. Suspicious findings from either modality triggered a second endoscopy with biopsy. Followup for cancer diagnoses was completed via multiple methods in October 2023. Primary end points included the 5-year NPC detection rate (overall and by stage) and the false-negative rate. Secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and referral rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 814 individuals (455 females; 56%) with a median age of 53 years (interquartile range, 46-60 years). Thirty-two NPC cases were detected (30 via MRI; 21 via endoscopy) over 5 years. MRI showed a significantly higher overall NPC detection rate (36.9 [95% CI, 25.9-52.1] vs. 25.8 [95% CI, 16.9-39.1] per 1000; p = .007) and early-stage tumor detection (20.9 [95% CI, 13.1-27.1] vs. 12.3 [95% CI, 6.7-22.5] per 1000; p = .020) than endoscopy. MRI also demonstrated a lower false-negative rate (3.0 [95% CI, 0.8-11.0] vs. 14.9 [95% CI, 8.4-26.5] per 1000; p = .024) and higher sensitivity (93.8% vs. 65.6%; p = .007) but lower specificity (84.0% vs. 92.8%; p &lt; .001) and PPV (19.6% vs. 27.6%; p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Single MRI demonstrated superior NPC detection versus endoscopy, particularly for early-stage tumors, in high-risk populations during a 5-year period, which suggests the potential for extending the rescreening interval to 5 years for MRI-negative individuals.</description>

Given that thyroid nodule evaluation and diagnosis typically occur in outpatient settings, we hypothesized that these disruptions would reduce thyroid cancer incidence. This study evaluates trends in thyroid cancer diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes at a U.S. comprehensive cancer center from 2017 to 2023. METHODS: We included adults with pathologically confirmed thyroid cancer diagnosis between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2023. Primary analyses assessed (1) annual percent change (APC) in thyroid cancer incidence from 2017-2023 and (2) incidence trends across three periods: pre-pandemic (Jan 2017-Mar 2020), pandemic (Apr 2020-Mar 2021), and COVID-years (Apr 2021-Dec 2023). Annual incidence rates were calculated using the total number of individuals cared for within our health system each year as the denominator. Secondary outcomes included tumor size, extent and timing of surgery, and 1-year all-cause mortality across time periods. RESULTS: Among 1,031 patients (68% women, 92% White, mean age 52 ± 15.5), age- and sex-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence declined from 34 to 15.6 per 100,000 persons between 2017 and 2022, with an average APC of -14.4%. Diagnoses rose slightly in 2023 (21 per 100,000) compared to 2022 but remained 38% below 2017 levels. No significant differences were observed in tumor size, surgical treatment, gender ratio, or 1-year all-cause mortality across timeframes. CONCLUSION: Age- and sex-adjusted annual incidence of thyroid cancer declined steadily from 2017 to 2022. The annual decrease in thyroid cancer continued through the pandemic years. Tumor size and mortality remained stable across all years evaluated. The increase in diagnoses noted in 2023 may be a correction due to missed cases during the years of the pandemic or could represent a new steady state incidence after years of decline.</description>

Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and radiotherapy (RT) are the two most common treatment modalities for HNC. However, both treatments are associated with adverse side effects, including hearing loss. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to evaluate the pooled prevalence of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) among HNC patients undergoing CRT versus RT. METHODOLOGY: A comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, DOAJ, AJOL, and the Cochrane Library was conducted using predefined key terms to identify original articles reporting the prevalence of SNHL in HNC patients treated with CRT or RT. Additionally, manual Google searches were performed to uncover relevant grey literature. The results were screened and included or excluded according to preset criteria. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) random-effects model was employed to calculate the overall pooled prevalence and separate prevalences in CRT and RT groups, as well as their respective heterogeneities, using Jamovi 2.3.28 software. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; .05 for all analyses. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of SNHL among HNC patients treated with CRT or RT was 54.5% (95% CI: 44.9% - 64.0%; I² = 90.35%, p &lt; .001). For CRT, the prevalence was 60.4% (95% CI: 50.5% - 70.2%; I² = 88.82%, p &lt; .001). In contrast, the prevalence for RT was 32.9% (95% CI: 21.3% - 44.4%; I² = 60.15%, p = .063). The risk of developing SNHL was nearly twice as high in patients treated with CRT compared to those treated with RT alone, with a prevalence ratio of 1.83. CONCLUSION: Both CRT and RT are associated with SNHL in HNC patients, with a significantly higher prevalence observed in those undergoing CRT compared to RT.</description>

Comprehensive recurrence risk stratification remains lacking. Here, we profile 482 MTC samples from 452 patients across ten Chinese clinical centers, identifying 10,092 proteins and mutations in 87.0% of patients. Clinically, MTC grading, concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma, and lymph node metastasis are significant recurrence risk factors, whereas at the genetic level, RET M918T and RET S891A mutations are correlated with high recurrence risk in sporadic and hereditary MTC, respectively. Ubiquitinomics show downregulated E3 ligases CUL4B and TRIM32 are associated with structural recurrence. We define three molecular subtypes with distinct outcomes and present an integrative machine learning model combining clinical, genomic, and proteomic features, validated in an independent test dataset of 105 patients and a published dataset. This multi-center, multi-omics study enhances the understanding of MTC heterogeneity and facilitates personalized patient management.</description>

This study compared self-reported speech function between patients surgically treated for OCC and healthy controls using the Speech Handicap Index (SHI) and identified factors associated with worse scores. METHODS: This is a multiinstitutional cross-sectional study of OCC patients and healthy controls recruited between July 2024 and March 2025. Participants completed the SHI and self-reported speech quality. Demographics, tumor, and treatment details were abstracted from the electronic health record for OCC. Group differences were assessed with t-tests, χ2, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Among 69 OCC and 90 controls, OCC patients had significantly higher mean SHI scores (50.2 vs. 34.7, p &lt; 0.01) and were less likely to rate their speech as "good" or "excellent" (47.8% vs. 85.6%, p &lt; 0.01). Both speech and psychosocial domain scores were significantly worse among OCC. Free flap reconstruction was associated with worse scores (29.6 vs. 15.5, p = 0.02) and worse self-rated speech quality. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with surgically treated oral cavity cancer have significantly impaired self-perceived speech and psychosocial functioning compared with healthy individuals. Greater deficits were observed in patients who required free flap reconstruction. Despite the functional deficit, nearly half of OCC patients reported satisfaction with their speech quality. These findings highlight the importance of using validated measures for speech function and support the need for early, multidisciplinary rehabilitation including speech therapy in this population, particularly for those undergoing free flap reconstruction.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ho AS, Luu M, Manzoor D, Maluf H, Bailey C, Balzer B, Walgama ES, Jang JK, Scher KC, Moyers JT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107847'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107847&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41534318/'&gt;41534318&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: While numerous cancer staging systems have incorporated grade into stage, the impact of grade on oral cavity carcinoma (OCC) prognosis has been conflicting. We investigated grade as a prognostic determinant in OCC staging. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression models of OCC patients identified via U.S. cancer registry data were constructed to determine associations between grade (G1 = low-grade, G2 = intermediate-grade, G3 = high-grade) and overall survival (OS). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to derive staging schema. RESULTS: Overall, 46,789 OCC cases were identified across 1,222 institutions. On univariate analysis, higher grade was associated with worse 5-yr OS (G1: 73% [95% CI 72-74%], G2: 61% [95 CI 60-61%], G3: 49% [95% CI 48-51%] (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors, these survival differences persisted. Compared to G1 tumors, both G2 (HR 1.25 [95% CI 1.19-1.30], p &lt; 0.001) and G3 (HR 1.52 [95% CI 1.45-1.61], p &lt; 0.001) tumors were associated with significantly worse OS. Similar results were seen when utilizing propensity score matching. RPA generated subgroups that mirrored AJCC8E, but with G3 cases performing worse for a given stage. A proposed TNM + G staging schema was created with AJCC8E G3 cases upstaged by one category. Overall, 11.5% (4,745/36,623) cases were upstaged. TNM + G performed better than AJCC8E by c-index (0.673 vs. 0.671) and Brier score (0.174 vs. 0.175). CONCLUSION: Large-scale analysis supports grade as an influential predictive determinant in OCC outcomes, with hazard on par with conventional staging factors. Incorporation of grade into stage strengthens existing AJCC OCC schema and pragmatically improves its ability to convey prognosis.</description>

This multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study (DRAGON trial, SRK-181-001) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, predictive biomarkers and efficacy of linavonkibart, a first-in-class fully human selective anti-latent TGFβ1 antibody with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The DRAGON trial was divided into three treatment parts: part A1 (dose-escalation cohorts with single-agent linavonkibart), part A2 (dose-escalation cohorts with the combination treatment of linavonkibart and pembrolizumab) and part B (dose-expansion cohorts with the combination treatment). The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of linavonkibart alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives included evaluation of linavonkibart pharmacokinetics for each treatment paradigm, assessment of anti-linavonkibart antibody development (parts A and B) and measurement of antitumor activity (part B) after treatment. All primary and secondary objectives were met in the study. Overall, linavonkibart had a manageable safety profile, and combined therapy with pembrolizumab was generally consistent with that of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Dermatological reactions were the only additional risk identified. Neither cytokine release syndrome nor infusion interruption was observed in any patient enrolled in DRAGON. In part A (n = 34), no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred (linavonkibart; ≤3,000 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 2,000 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W)). In part B (n = 78), patients progressing on prior anti-PD-1 therapy received linavonkibart (1,500 mg Q3W/1,000 mg Q2W) with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W). This combination demonstrated confirmed objective response rates of 20.0%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 9.1% in anti-PD-1-resistant patients with clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), melanoma, head and neck squamous cell cancer and urothelial cancer, respectively. Biomarker data provide proof of mechanism and a potential ccRCC patient selection strategy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04291079 .</description>

Abemaciclib targets this pathway and may offer therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting abemaciclib efficacy. METHODS: In the NGS-based TRIUMPH trial, patients with platinum-refractory HNSCC harboring CDK4/6 pathway alteration received abemaciclib, classified as "long stable disease (SD)" (progression-free survival [PFS] &gt; 6 months) and "short SD" (PFS &lt; 6 months). In this post hoc analysis, the genetic profiles were compared. In vitro studies were conducted to assess abemaciclib's antitumor effects in HNSCC cell lines. RESULTS: Among 23 patients, abemaciclib showed limited efficacy (overall response rate, 0%; disease control rate, 43.5%). CDKN2A deletion was significantly associated with long SD (p = 0.0078), unlike CCND1 amplification and CDKN2A mutation. In vitro, CDKN2A-deleted cell lines showed greater sensitivity to abemaciclib. CONCLUSIONS: Although abemaciclib resulted in limited tumor regression, CDKN2A deletion may be a predictive biomarker for prolonged disease stabilization. Further investigations on genomically selected populations and combination strategies are required.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 8510 laryngoscopic images from 743 patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. A dual-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture was constructed, integrating multi-scale feature analysis with cross-attention fusion mechanisms. The model was rigorously evaluated through internal-external validation and a prospective reader study involving 12 endoscopists of varying expertise. RESULTS: The AI system demonstrated superior performance in three-tier classification, achieving F1-scores of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.869-0.896) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.844-0.878) for high-risk lesion identification in internal and external validation, respectively. AI assistance significantly improved junior endoscopists' sensitivity from 67.1% to 81.4% (P &lt; 0.001), effectively narrowing diagnostic performance disparities with senior experts. The system maintained robust generalizability across institutions, with 90.5% accuracy under heterogeneous imaging protocols. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI framework provides a clinically effective solution for reliable VCL risk stratification and reduces diagnostic variability between clinicians. Validated across multiple centers, this dual-scale ViT approach establishes a novel paradigm for laryngoscopic diagnosis and holds significant potential to standardize diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings.</description>

However, there is a clear need for improved prognostic tools. This study aimed to identify immune-related tissue biomarkers associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 inhibition. This national real-world phase IV multicenter retrospective cohort study included Danish patients treated between 2017 and 2023. Pre-treatment biopsies were collected for immunohistochemical analyses. All patients were PD-L1 positive with histologically confirmed rmHNSCC treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Biomarker expression was assessed for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20, CD66b, CD68, STING, cGAS, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), using the median expression as the cut-off value. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was obtained from 263 eligible patients. Concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 were associated with a lower risk of progression (HRPFS: 0.47 [95 % CI: 0.33-0.67]). This interaction appeared to be driven by p16+ oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), where patients with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 showed a median 2-year PFS of 68 % [95 % CI: 42-86] in contrast to those with one or none of the two markers above the median level with a 2-year PFS of 3 % [95 % CI: 0-12] (p &lt; 0.001). In this real-world cohort, a subgroup with a promising prognosis was identified. This subgroup was characterized by p16+ OPC along with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68. PD-L1 alone showed no significant association with outcomes.</description>

The Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) could be maintained in this model for a certain period of time. This model was confirmed to simulate PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, providing a reliable in vitro model for the verification and clinical prediction of the therapeutic effects of relevant immunotherapy drugs for head and neck cancer (HNC). METHODS: Fresh tumor tissue samples were obtained to establish an ALI head and neck cancer organoid (ALI-HNCO) model. The oncological characteristics of the organoids and their homology with parental tumors were verified using histomorphological analysis. T lymphocytes and fibroblasts in the organoids were detected using immunofluorescence staining. After treating with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor), the secreted levels of the cytokine interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and changes in the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ distributed in the immune microenvironment of the organoid, as well as the expression of CD69+ immune cell subsets, were analyzed using flow cytometry. The FVS staining assay was used to verify the killing of tumor cells by cytotoxic T cells. RESULTS: The comparison of immunofluorescence in organoids and parental tumor tissues showed that CD3+ lymphocytes and SMA+ cells were also present in the active organoid tissues. Approximately 17.86% (5/28) of the ALI-HNCO model could amplify specific reactive CD8+ T lymphocytes, generating tumor specificity and cytotoxicity. DISCUSSION: An in vitro HNC immune microenvironment model was successfully constructed using the ALI method. This model maintained the proportions and structures of the components of the original tumor, such as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer-associated fibroblasts, for a period of time in vitro, providing an experimental platform for exploring the complex crosstalk between HNC cells and multiple cell colonies. This study preliminarily validated the feasibility of using ALI organoid models to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy drugs in treating HNC, providing a reliable and stable preclinical model, and new ideas for drug screening platforms for personalized precision medicine in HNC.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on UG-FNA results from 10,839 patients (12,528 nodules) at Deyang People's Hospital between December 2021 and September 2024. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) combined with cell block technology identified 732 Bethesda III nodules (detection rate: 5.8%). Among these, 180 cases with postoperative histological follow-up were analyzed, including 101 cases with preoperative BRAF V600E testing using cell blocks. Using histology (5th edition WHO classification) as the gold standard, the influence of gender, age, nodule location, diameter, and cytological subcategory (with nuclear atypia vs. with other features) on malignant risk was analyzed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. The diagnostic value of BRAF V600E testing was evaluated. RESULTS: Among 180 Bethesda III nodules, malignancies accounted for 62.2% (112/180), predominantly papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC; 110/112, 98.2%), while low-risk neoplasms and benign lesions constituted 15.0% (27/180) and 22.8% (41/180), respectively. Multivariate analysis identified nodule size &lt;1 cm (P &lt; 0.001) and the "nuclear atypia" subcategory as independent predictors, with the latter showing extreme predictive value for malignancy (OR = 121.854, P &lt; 0.001; capturing 98.2% malignancies) and modest association with low-risk neoplasms (OR = 7.014, P = 0.001). BRAF V600E testing (n=101) demonstrated 82.0% sensitivity (100% specificity) for PTC but exhibited striking subtype-dependent performance (classical PTC: 90.2% [46/51] vs. FVPTC: 40.0% [4/10], P = 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that combined cytology-BRAF testing achieved AUCs of 0.873 (95%CI:0.797-0.948) for malignancy and 0.892 (95%CI:0.822-0.962) for PTC, though accuracy was significantly lower for FVPTC (AUC = 0.481) versus classical PTC (AUC = 0.911, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In Bethesda III nodules, a diameter &lt;1 cm or the "with nuclear atypia" subcategory indicates a high malignant risk (OR = 121.854), warranting active management. Preoperative BRAF V600E testing provides excellent detection for classical PTC (sensitivity 90.2%, specificity 100%) but exhibits limited sensitivity for FVPTC (40%). Based on the 3rd edition TBSRTC and 5th edition WHO classification, our risk-stratified algorithm could reduce unnecessary surgeries by 25-30% in indeterminate nodules while maintaining perfect specificity for classical PTC, achieving optimal clinical decision-making.</description>

Hence, laboratory parameter profiles are of considerable interest as potential perioperative predictors. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed a comprehensive set of laboratory parameters in 233 patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) who underwent tumor resection and reconstruction. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 30%, with wound dehiscence (12.4%), pulmonary embolism (PE, 11.6%), and surgical revision (10.3%) being the most common complications. Dynamic analysis of perioperative laboratory parameters from one week before to 49 days after surgery revealed that patients who developed complications showed less pronounced decreases in hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte levels. These patients also exhibited altered coagulation and electrolyte profiles. Statistical analysis using logistic regression identified hematocrit slope as independent predictor. Meanwhile, random forest modeling highlighted INR and aPTT as key markers. Subgroup analysis showed that PE, the most clinically significant complication, was associated with abnormal potassium, urea, and protein profiles. Whereas a therapy-related increase in aPTT was observed postoperatively, INR alterations were already evident preoperatively. Conversely, local complications such as wound dehiscence, surgical revision, and graft failure were more strongly associated with deteriorating hematological parameters. DISCUSSION: Given their multifactorial nature, influenced by comorbidities, tumor biology, and perioperative management, these findings highlight the need for longitudinal laboratory monitoring and prospective validation in controlled settings. Integrating dynamic laboratory trends into multimodal prediction models may facilitate earlier risk stratification and improve individualized perioperative management in head and neck reconstructive surgery.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 48 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) salivary gland tissue sections (5 µm thickness) were analyzed, including 8 NP, 24 PA, and 16 MEC specimens. ATR-FTIR spectra were acquired directly from routine histopathological slides over the 4000-400 per cm range without chemical deparaffinization. The spectral data were then processed using multivariate analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA) to reveal biochemical variations among the tissue groups. Supervised classification was then performed using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN) algorithms with 6-fold cross-validation to evaluate classification performance. RESULTS: Distinct spectral differences were detected among NP, PA, and MEC tissues, particularly in protein (amide I-II), lipid (CH-stretching), and nucleic acid (phosphate) regions. OPLS-DA demonstrated clear class discrimination (3D: J₁ = 4.1250, J₂ = 2.2121). The SVM classifier achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy (F1-scores: NP = 1.00, PA = 0.96, MEC = 0.94; overall accuracy = 95.83%), outperforming the kNN model (accuracy = 93.75%). CONCLUSIONS: Combining ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with ML-based multivariate analysis provides a highly accurate method of differentiating NP, PA and MEC salivary gland tissues based on their biochemical fingerprints. This integrative approach establishes the basis for a rapid, non-invasive, label-free diagnostic tool that is compatible with clinical practice and applicable to routine histopathological samples.</description>

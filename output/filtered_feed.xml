      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Singh SP, Prasad S, Dean PM, Kujur AL, Jaiswal G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41655423/'&gt;41655423&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Extranodal extension (ENE) of cervical lymph node metastases is a key prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the survival impact of ENE in HNSCC and identified global research trends relevant to this research field through a complementary bibliometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus were systematically searched during 2000-2025. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Biblioshiny package of R to identify and map the publication trends, influential authors, and major institutional contributions between 2010 and 2025. RESULTS: Of the 839 retrieved records, 711 studies were screened, and 16 studies comprising approximately 3900 patients met all inclusion criteria. The bibliometric analysis of 120 Scopus-indexed publications demonstrated a marked increase in ENE-related research from 2015 onward, driven primarily by institutions in Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea. Keyword mapping indicated expanding intersections of ENE research with radiomics, prognostic modelling, and refinement of staging systems. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant association between ENE and adverse survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed consistently poor prognostic implications across both pathologic and radiologic ENE assessments. CONCLUSION: ENE in cervical lymph node metastases is an independent and strong predictor of adverse survival in HNSCC. The increasing global attention to ENE highlights its crucial role in multidisciplinary oncologic management. Therefore, standardized pathological and imaging-based assessment of ENE is essential for developing superior prognostic models and optimizing future treatment planning strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rühle A, Subramani R, Su J, O'Sullivan B, Waldron JN, Hope A, Bayley A, McPartlin A, Malik N, Bratman SV, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70424'&gt;10.1002/lary.70424&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41654325/'&gt;41654325&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prognostic importance of impaired vocal cord mobility (VCM) in T2N0 glottic cancer. METHODS: All patients with T2N0 glottic cancer treated with partial laryngeal IMRT in 2009-2021 in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. For comparison, cohorts with T1N0 and T3N0 disease were also included. Locoregional failure (LRF), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared among T1N0, T2N0 with normal VCM (T2-Normal-VCM), T2N0 with impaired VCM (T2-Impaired-VCM), and T3N0 groups. Multivariable analysis (MVA) assessed the prognostic value of VCM within the T2N0 group. RESULTS: A total of 642 cases were included: 288 T1N0, 224 T2N0 (147 T2-Normal-VCM, 77 T2-Impaired-VCM), and 130 T3N0. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (IQR 3.4-6.2). Five-year LRF for T1N0, T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 were 4% (95% CI 2-6), 9% (5-15), 27% (17-38), and 35% (27-44), respectively. Corresponding DFS was 83% (78-88), 80% (73-87), 55% (45-68), and 50% (41-60), while OS was 85% (80-90), 86% (80-92), 71% (61-83), and 59% (50-69), respectively. In T2N0, MVA confirmed that impaired VCM was associated with higher LRF (aHR 3.72 [95% CI 1.79-7.71], p &lt; 0.001), lower DFS (aHR 2.74 [1.68-4.45], p &lt; 0.001), and lower OS (aHR 2.07 [1.17-3.67], p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary cohort, LRF rates increased stepwise from T1N0 to T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 glottic cancer. Within T2N0 disease, impaired VCM is an adverse prognostic factor, supporting subdivision into T2a (normal VCM) and T2b (impaired VCM) in future TNM revisions. Prospective studies are warranted to assess whether treatment intensification can improve outcomes for T2-Impaired-VCM disease.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li Y, Wang P, Cao J, Liu H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The oncologist | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1093/oncolo/oyag017'&gt;10.1093/oncolo/oyag017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41652888/'&gt;41652888&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased markedly in recent years, largely driven by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma (WDTC). WDTC is biologically heterogeneous, with generally favorable prognosis but substantial variability in clinical behavior. Advances in molecular imaging, artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostics, and liquid biopsy have altered diagnostic strategies, while targeted therapy and immunotherapy have expanded treatment options for selected patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) model has therefore become an essential component of WDTC management through the integration of expertise from multiple specialties. METHODS: This review examines the role of MDT application in WDTC through analysis of relevant literature and international clinical guidelines, focusing on MDT composition, implementation models, clinical roles across diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, and current limitations. Differences in MDT recommendations among guidelines from various regions were also compared. RESULTS: MDT involvement supports personalized decision-making in WDTC, particularly in cases with indeterminate diagnosis, risk-adapted treatment selection, recurrent disease, and radioiodine-refractory progression. Persistent challenges include overtreatment of low-risk disease, suboptimal management of high-risk cases, limited MDT implementation in primary hospitals, uneven specialty participation, and variability in decision-making within guideline gray zones. CONCLUSION: The MDT model provides a structured framework to improve risk-adapted management of WDTC. Future efforts should prioritize refined risk-stratified MDT models, integration of decision-support tools, and expansion of remote platforms to enhance consistency and quality of management.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 202 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer who completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical data such as age, sex, educational status, employment, tumor size, ATA risk classification, TNM stage, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy were recorded. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, Spearman correlation, and multivariable linear regression to determine predictors of global HRQoL score. RESULTS: The median global HRQoL was 58.3 (IQR: 50.0-75.0). Functional scores were highest in role, emotional, cognitive, and social domains (median 66.7). Fatigue was the most prominent symptom (median: 44.4), followed by pain, dyspnea, and insomnia (each 33.3). Female sex, lower educational level, and higher RAI dose were associated with lower global HRQoL scores. Emotional functioning was significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 55 years. Multivariable regression analysis identified sex, education level, RAI dose, and TNM stage as significant predictors of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Despite generally favorable prognoses in DTC, multiple demographic and treatment-related variables significantly influence patient-reported HRQoL. RAI therapy and disease stage may impact HRQoL less than previously assumed. These findings highlight the importance of individualized supportive care strategies in survivorship plans.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study involved 1,088 patients who underwent oncologic head and neck surgery from August 2012 to November 2024. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: The main outcome measure was 60-day Emergency Department (ED) visit or readmission after primary hospital discharge following surgery. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by state-level area deprivation index (ADI). RESULTS: Predictors of re-presentation within 60 days of discharge on univariate analysis include tumor stage 4 (OR: 1.52, 95% Cl: 1.01-2.31, P = .044), longer primary length of stay (OR: 1.03, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.05, P &lt; .001), and residency in the 4th quartile state ADI (OR: 1.54, 95% Cl: 1.03-2.31, P = .037). Multivariable logistic regression identified laryngeal cancer (OR: 1.60, 95% Cl: 1.16-2.21, 0.004) and discharge with home health or other care facilities (2.22, 95% Cl: 1.67-2.96, P &lt; .001) as predictive factors. Patients from low ADI neighborhoods (Q1-3) were more likely to be discharged home, whereas those from high ADI neighborhoods (Q4) where almost twice as likely to be discharged with home health or to care facilities than home alone (18.70% vs 10.29%, P = &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that clinical and systemic factors contribute to re-presentation to the hospital after major oncologic head and neck surgery. Addressing these factors through targeted policies and institutional initiatives may help mitigate the morbidity and cost associated with representation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Caraway J, Millay D, Zarrella D, Kim HE, Wrozek T, Yang A, Zamani M, Watson N, Heckman C, Garrett S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70136'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70136&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41649240/'&gt;41649240&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is a lack of consensus regarding the superiority of specimen-based versus tumor bed-based intraoperative margin analysis in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC). The purpose of this study is to perform the first meta-analysis examining intraoperative margin assessment methods in OCSCC with the goal of determining if there is a significant difference in patient outcomes between specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Studies met inclusion criteria if they conducted intraoperative specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis in patients with OCSCC and reported patient outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze the compiled data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 1988 articles for initial review of which 9 (1240 participants) met criteria for inclusion and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that a specimen-based approach is associated with higher intraoperative re-resection rate (P &lt; .05), significantly lower final positive margin rate (P &lt; .05), and decreased local recurrence when compared to the tumor bed-based approach (P &lt; .05). However, there was no significant difference in overall recurrence when comparing intraoperative margin analysis methods (P &gt; .05). Additionally, none of the included studies noted a significant difference in survival outcomes between tumor bed versus specimen-based methods. CONCLUSION: Specimen-based frozen margin analysis in OCSCC results in lower false negative rates and improved local control; however, there is no significant difference in overall recurrence or survival when comparing specimen-based vs tumor bed-based techniques.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of 86 patients with sinonasal masses treated at the University of Arizona between January 2010 and December 2024. SETTING: Single tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Patients were stratified into urban (n = 41), suburban (n = 12), or rural (n = 33) locations based on home location population size. We analyzed patient demographics and clinical data to determine the influence of geographic location on diagnostic delays, treatment, and survival. Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 62.3 years across all locations. Diabetes was more common in rural locations (36.4%) (P = .006). Patients from rural locations exhibited the highest tobacco exposure (21.2% current smokers, 33.3% former smokers) (P = .044). Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common subtype (33.7%). The longest interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was in rural locations (342.7 days) (P = .29). Geographic location was the strongest predictor of diagnostic delays, with urban locations independently associated with a 205-day shorter time to diagnosis than rural locations (P = .021). Patients from urban locations received the most radiation therapy (82.9%) (P = .047). Race and geographic location significantly influenced the risk of death (Likelihood ratio χ²(6) = 24.21, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: This study identifies significant geographic disparities in diabetes, smoking, diagnostic delays, treatment, and racial and ethnic risk of death. Prospective studies are required to investigate these factors further and improve equitable access to comprehensive care for patients with sinonasal masses.</description>

Current therapies for metastatic MTC comprise various tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, but resistance often appears due to the need for lifelong treatments. Like in other tumors, genetic, epigenetic, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and cell-cell interaction events influence drug response. However, progress in understanding MTC biology is limited by the lack of reliable in vivo and in vitro models. This study aims to develop a patient-derived model faithfully reproducing the microenvironmental alterations present in MTC. METHODS: We applied a two-step protocol consisting of a first phase in which primary cells are cultivated as multicellular spheroids and a second phase in which they are switched to adherent cultures. After evaluation of the genetic background by targeted Next Generation Sequencing, we characterized our cells phenotype by examining a panel of stem/progenitor-related markers, the secretory abilities by ELISAs, the drug response by proliferation assays, the in vivo angiogenic and invasiveness by the use of zebrafish model, the in vitro invasivity by Matrigel Dome assays and the spatial variation of stem/progenitor marker in both 3D cell models and tissue samples by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Our model allowed the establishment of eight MTC patient-derived cell lines with different genetic backgrounds. The cultures faithfully reproduced the changes in stem and progenitor markers that we detected in our cohort of MTC tissue samples and could be successfully xenotransplanted in zebrafish model, showing both angiogenetic and invasive properties. Drug screening assays revealed the potential of our model for the study of patient-specific responses, as we were able to identify different candidate regulators of the sensitivity to currently available therapies for MTC. CONCLUSIONS: Our two-step protocol successfully generated primary MTC lines that maintain high plasticity, can be cultivated for several passages, and recreate the heterogeneity observed in patients' tissues. Our model will offer a robust platform for preclinical drug testing and mechanistic studies, addressing a longstanding gap in MTC research. It enables exploration of tumor microenvironment interactions and personalized therapeutic responses, supporting progress beyond current genomic-driven frameworks.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based regimens, received paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 every 21 days plus weekly cetuximab (C) 250 mg/m2 for up to six cycles, followed by C maintenance. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best overall response (BoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age 64 years). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had a primary tumor in the oropharynx, 17 (29.8%) in the oral cavity, 9 (15.8%) in the hypopharynx, and 6 (10.5%) in the larynx. The ORR was 43.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7% to 57.6%], the BoR was 47.4% (95% CI 34.0% to 61.0%) with nine (15.8%) complete responses, and the DCR was 71.9% (95% CI 58.5% to 83.0%). DoR was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.1 months-not reached). Median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI 5.5-8.4 months) and 12.2 months (95% CI 10.5-17.6 months), respectively. Six-month PFS and OS rates were 49.0% and 73.0%, respectively. The most frequent non-hematological treatment-related adverse events were C-associated skin rash (78.9%) and PTX-related polyneuropathy (35.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective trial specifically evaluating PTX plus C after failure of first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with R/M SCCHN. The observed clinical activity and tolerability support this widely available regimen as a potential standard-of-care option in the absence of randomized evidence in this setting.</description>

This prospective analysis included 35 patients with biopsy-proven hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma who received platinum-based chemoradiotherapy and underwent pretreatment FDG PET/CT and interim FDG PET/CT (iPET) at a cumulative RT doses of 36.0-45.0 Gy. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor (PT) and combined total lymph nodes for both pre-PET and iPET were analyzed, and their percentage reductions in iPET were calculated. The optimal cutoff values of the metabolic parameters were derived from receiver operating characteristic curves. The outcomes were compared between patients with metabolic parameters above and below the respective cutoff values. Disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) was defined as a biopsy-proven tumor or unequivocal clinical and radiological evidence of progression. Twelve (34%) patients experienced disease recurrence during a median follow-up of 52 months. Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the reduction ratio of the SUVmax of the PT (ΔSUVp; hazard ratio, 7.685; p = 0.008) was a significant predictor of disease recurrence. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that a smaller ΔSUVp was associated with worse progression-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.002). Metabolic parameters measured using iPET may be useful predictors of disease recurrence in patients with hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with chemoradiotherapy. In this study, ΔSUVp was the best prognostic indicator.</description>

Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance. These findings support individualized counseling and perioperative planning while acknowledging the overall safety of thyroidectomy in this population.</description>

Although squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) represents 85-90% of LC, rare non-SCC tumors-including laryngeal sarcomas (LS), neuroendocrine carcinomas (LNC), malignant salivary gland tumors (LMSGT), and mucosal melanomas (LMM)-are uncommon but clinically challenging. We combined a bicentric retrospective cohort with a systematic literature review to provide an integrated assessment of these entities. METHODS: Patients with non-SCC malignant laryngeal tumors treated with curative intent at two Italian tertiary centers were retrospectively analyzed. Tumors were classified as LS, LNC, LMSGT, or LMM. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease specific survival (DSS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). A systematic review contextualized institutional outcomes. RESULTS: 74 patients were included: 34 LS, 25 LNC, 13 LMSGT, and 2 LMM. Surgery was the primary treatment in 98.6 % of cases. LS and LMSGT demonstrated favorable survival, whereas LNC showed poor outcomes (median OS, 2.89 years) and the highest recurrence rate (72 %). Radical tumor excision achieved effective loco-regional control across histologies. LMM prognosis was dismal, with recurrence in both cases. The literature review revealed marked heterogeneity and wide survival ranges, reflecting rarity and biological diversity. CONCLUSION: Rare non-SCC laryngeal tumors comprise heterogeneous and often aggressive diseases with variable prognoses. Despite the absence of standardized management, radical surgery provides effective loco-regional control. Integrating bicentric clinical experience with published evidence highlights the need for multicenter collaboration to optimize treatment strategies and improve outcomes in this rare oncologic setting worldwide today.</description>

Our study reports the prevalence, disease characteristics, and nature of the desire for MAiD in patients with HNC who underwent the process in Ontario. The aim is to better understand this population and identify gaps in our current system of care. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis for the period June 17, 2016 to December 31, 2022. Data were received from the Office of the Chief Coroner Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-six persons received MAiD. The average age was 72.4 years (SD 12.22) with 260 of the patients being men (73.03%). The most common HNC primary tumor site was the oral cavity 109 (30.6%). The most reported reason was inadequate control of symptoms other than pain (79.21%) followed by inadequate pain control or concerns about it (75%). The patient's private residence (55.62%) was the most common setting. Patients were more likely to live in wealthier neighborhoods and in large urban centers. Future prediction of MAiD uptake shows a linear year-by-year increase. CONCLUSION: The use of MAiD in HNC has been steadily increasing since its legalization and is projected to continue increasing. There is a male predominance that is aligned with the incidence and prevalence of HNC nationally. Overall, MAiD is an increasingly employed choice for HNC patients receiving treatment for disease without curative intent.</description>

Our goal was to perform a large multicentre evaluation of WPOI as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective pathology data was collated from 14 institutions and compared with clinical outcome in 1374 OSCC patients with upfront curative resection. Most cases were of oral tongue (n = 645, 47%); T2 (33%) and N0 (59%). WPOI 1-3 frequency was 29.4%, WPOI 4 47% and WPOI 5 22%. On univariable analysis, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) was 54.2% for WPOI 5 vs. 69.7% for WPOI 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001). The locoregional control (LRC) was 68.9% vs 79.2% (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) 68.4% vs 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression in the entire cohort, WPOI 4 or 5 was strongly correlated with other known poor prognostic factors and not an independent predictor of OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.52), LRC or DFS. However, in early-stage (pT1-2 N0) patients treated with surgery alone without adjuvant radiotherapy, WPOI 5 was a robust independent predictor of DFS (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.54-12.32, p = 0.006), OS (HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.1, p = 0.020) and LRC (HR 3.52, 95% CI 2.13-5.82, p &lt;0.001) after applying inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. Furthermore, in the entire cohort of early-stage patients, interaction modeling showed that adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces the risk for both DFS and LRC for those with WPOI-5 (Interaction p = 0.002). Therefore, it may act as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. The prognostic and predictive role of WPOI-5 should be validated in prospective trials.</description>

We reviewed the evidence in the literature on the role of Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Controlling Nutritional Status Score (CONUT), and Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII) in predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) in thyroid cancer. METHODS: Two reviewers searched CENTRAL, Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases till 24th August 2025 for relevant publications. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eligible. Combined results demonstrated that elevated SII was slightly but significantly correlated with increased risk of LNM (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 1.00-1.01; I² = 93%). Results failed to change in the sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analysis based on location and histology indicated non-significant results while meta-regression did not identify any significant moderators. Pooled analysis indicated no significant association between low PNI and DFS (HR: 1.45 95% CI: 0.97, 2.18 I2 = 80%) and LNM (HR: 1.31 95% CI: 0.89, 1.92 I2 = 73%) in thyroid cancer patients. Meta-analysis also showed that high CONUT was associated with a tendency of worse DFS in thyroid cancer, but results were non-significant (HR: 3.25 95% CI: 0.99, 10.69 I2 = 86%). However, meta-analysis showed that high CONUT was significantly associated with worse OS (HR: 9.67 95% CI: 1.90, 49.25 I2 = 61%). CONCLUSIONS: Limited data suggest that high SII may be marginally associated with increased risk of LNM in thyroid cancer, the clinical significance of which is questionable. PNI was not found to be associated with LNM or DFS in thyroid cancer patients. High CONUT was associated with poor OS and a non-significant tendency for worse DFS in thyroid cancer.</description>

Early detection of recurrence is critical, yet effective surveillance methods are limited. This study aims to evaluate the utility of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples for identifying recurrent NPC. A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included. EBV DNA levels in both nasopharyngeal brush and plasma samples were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. Head and neck MRI, sinus endoscopy examination, and biopsy of suspicious lesions were used as the gold standard to confirm recurrence. Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls. Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%). The positive predictive value was similar between methods, whereas the negative predictive value was markedly higher for the nasopharyngeal brush group (97.3% vs. 80.7%). These findings suggest that EBV DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples is a highly sensitive and minimally invasive supplementary tool for monitoring NPC recurrence. This approach offers superior sensitivity and an improved negative predictive value compared to plasma EBV DNA testing, and may enhance early surveillance and clinical management of NPC recurrence.</description>

The management of non-metastatic, locoregionally recurrent or second primary cancers is a complex multidisciplinary challenge that often occurs without guidance from robust clinical trials. In 2023, the NRG Oncology cooperative group created the Recurrent and Metastatic Working Group with the express directive to investigate how resources could optimally address the key questions for the recurrent and metastatic populations. Here, we present our view of the state of the science and present considerations for future investigations.</description>

While the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led the way to a new era of treatment possibilities, the current state-of-the-science calls for further innovation and a nuanced approach to clinical trial design to address a number of unmet needs. This white paper from the NRG Oncology Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Working Group aims to critically identify gaps in clinical practice and the scientific literature and to propose actionable recommendations for future research in the framework of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</description>

The aim of this study was to assess progression-free status at 24 months as a potential surrogate endpoint for overall survival at the patient level, within a large, retrospective cohort of patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included all consecutive patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic, HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer who underwent radiotherapy (dose ≥50 Gy [relative biological effectiveness]) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (New York, NY, USA). Post-radiotherapy follow-up consisted of a clinical evaluation 8-12 weeks after treatment, then surveillance every 3 months for 2 years and every 6-12 months thereafter, incorporating imaging and physical examination to assess response and detect disease recurrence. The primary dichotomous outcome was progression-free status at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. Overall survival outcomes were compared with those of age-matched, sex-matched, and calendar year-matched general populations sourced from US Life Tables, using expected survival estimates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). FINDINGS: Between Jan 11, 2013, and Dec 27, 2022, 1245 patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiotherapy were included in the analysis (median age 61 years [IQR 55-68]; 1093 [87·8%] male patients and 152 [12·2%] female patients). Median follow-up from the start of radiotherapy was 63·3 months (IQR 40·4-91·3). 5-year overall survival was 89·3% (95% CI 87·4-91·2). 1183 patients had follow-up data for 24-month progression-free status assessment with 1044 (88·3%) progression-free at 24 months after initiating radiotherapy. The SMR after reaching 24-month progression-free status was 1·2 (95% CI 1·0-1·6; p=0·090). The 5-year subsequent overall survival of patients who reached 24-month progression-free status was 93·1% (95% CI 91·1-95·1), similar to the expected 5-year overall survival of 92·7% in the matched US general population. In patients with disease progression within 24 months, 5-year subsequent overall survival was 33·5% (25·4-44·2), versus an expected 5-year overall survival of 91·1% in the matched US general population, with a corresponding SMR of 17·9 (14·3-22·2; p&lt;0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Progression-free status at 24 months was a strong prognostic marker for overall survival at the patient level in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer and future trial-level analysis is now warranted. The adoption of this endpoint has the potential to accelerate therapeutic development by enabling earlier evaluation of treatment activity, thereby facilitating the timely introduction of novel therapies to this patient population before the availability of mature overall survival data. FUNDING: This research was funded in part through the US National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Support Grant P30 CA008748.</description>

We also examined the characteristics that could predict chemotherapy medication quality. METHODS: Samples of seven commonly used chemotherapy medications were collected: cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, ifosfamide, leucovorin, methotrexate, and oxaliplatin. Stockouts and medicine prices were recorded at public national hospitals and community pharmacies. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network's harmonized guidelines for sub-Saharan Africa, we estimated the costs of medications to treat early-stage breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and head and neck cancer. Every sample was tested for quality using high-performance liquid chromatography against USP standards. We ran logistic regressions to assess medicine characteristics that could predict substandard and falsified chemotherapy medications. RESULTS: Stockouts of chemotherapy medications in public hospitals were observed in three of four countries. Other than in Malawi where medications are free when available in the public sector, chemotherapy medications were unaffordable, costing government worker salary equivalents of 47-242 days, 233-869 days, and 22-196 days to treat early-stage breast cancer, CRC, and head and neck cancer, respectively. On average across the population, $36 US dollars (USD) (95% CI, $50 USD to $134 USD, 9%-25% of medication cost) was spent on poor-quality medicines for treatment of breast cancer, $32 USD (95% CI, $6 USD to $214 USD, 0.5%-17%) for CRC, and $15 USD (95% CI, $4 USD to $49 USD, 2%-21%) for head and neck cancer. Price of the medication, public/private source, and medicine registration status were poor predictors of medicine quality. CONCLUSION: We found that medicines for cancer treatment are unaffordable without government subsidies. Moreover, poor-quality chemotherapy medicines are hard to detect without chemical testing. Government policies and supply chain practice changes are needed to improve the availability, affordability, and quality of chemotherapy medications in sub-Saharan Africa.</description>

This approach is associated with early adverse effects, notably oral mucositis (OM). The C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) is a promising novel biomarker used to assess the severity of inflammatory responses in various chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of pretreatment CAR for the occurrence and severity of OM of varying grades during RT in patients with LC. METHODS: The pretreatment CAR values were calculated in 68 patients treated with RT due to locally advanced or advanced LC. RESULTS: The increased incidence of severe grade OM in LC patients between weeks III and VII of RT was significantly associated with higher CAR values. A high CAR was significantly correlated with an increased risk of grade 3 OM at the end of the IIIrd (p = 0.026), IVth (p = 0.018), Vth (p = 0.027), VIth (p = 0.018), and VIIth (p = 0.004) week of RT. Multivariable analysis demonstrates a higher probability of developing severe OM in LC patients with an elevated median CAR following IIIrd (p = 0.025), IVth (p = 0.025), Vth (p = 0.025), VIth (p = 0.020), and VIIth (p = 0.035) cycle of irradiation. Furthermore, CAR values allowed reliable differentiation of patients who developed grade 3 OM between the IIIrd-VIIth weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment CAR value indicates clinical utility in predicting the likelihood of severe OM induced by RT-based therapy in patients with LC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the framework proposed, the histopathological images are subjected to a preprocessing technique, and then, the images are fed directly to the NASNet-Large model for the extraction of high-level discriminative texture features. The resultant vectors obtained from the features extracted act as input to the search space of Archimedes Optimization Algorithm that carries out dimensionality reduction and optimal hyperparameter tuning simultaneously. The optimized feature subset is fed to the final classifier, namely the Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder that learns robust latent representations. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.38%, a precision of 95.15%, a sensitivity of 91.78%, a specificity of 91.85%, and an F1-score of 93.72%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of the SSDA-AOA framework as an effective tool for the early detection and precise classification of oral cancer, paving the way for improved patient outcomes through timely intervention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This innovative approach may significantly enhance patient outcomes by facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment, addressing the urgent need for more reliable diagnostic tools in oncology.</description>

Surprisingly, there is no consistent, standardised global approach to evaluating the dosimetry of this prescription across different centres treating head and neck cancer (HNC). This study aimed to quantify global dose variations for identical prescriptions across international centres treating oropharyngeal cancer, to establish the foundation for future outcome-based studies and improve consistency of interpretation worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were consecutively treated from 2017 onwards with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) at eight globally recognised radiotherapy departments. These centres were categorised into four categories: North American, North European, Oceanic, and Asian. RESULTS: The study included 1,514 patients from eight centres and revealed 40 different dose prescriptions, ranging from 55 Gy in 20 to 70 Gy in 35 fractions. When normalised to a 70 Gy prescription, the mean CTV dose showed a 4% median difference across centres. European and Oceania centres deviated by 0.4%, while North American and Asian centres had 2% variability. Near-minimum CTV doses (D98%) ranged from 68.7 Gy to 71.4 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the wide-ranging implementation of dose prescriptions in HNC. The lack of a standardised global approach to HNC treatment dose prescription carries potential implications for patient care, collaborative research, and treatment de-escalation or radiotherapy dose-painting strategies. This study highlights the need for careful interpretation of dose prescription standards across international centres, to analyse radiotherapy outcomes more accurately in light of their varied implementation.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study included 3578 NPC patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Ninety-four RTLI patients were recruited based on inclusion criteria and matched 1:1 with 97 control subjects using propensity scores. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 135) and the validation cohort (n = 59). Deep transfer learning (DTL) features and dosiomics features were extracted from ADC map and three-dimensional dose distribution, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were employed to identify predictive features. Subsequently, eight machine learning classification models were trained to establish a prediction framework, encompassing Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. The performance of clinical, DTL, dosiomics and feature fusion model was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We constructed six pre-trained transfer learning networks and extracted DTL features, respectively. The results showed that pre-trained WideResNet 101 exhibited superior performance with an AUC of 0.786 in the validation cohort. The clinical model based on D1cc and induction chemotherapy demonstrated an AUC of 0.794 and the dosiomics model demonstrated an AUC of 0.903. Features fusion model demonstrated the highest AUC values in both the training (0.988) and validation (0.940) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion model based on pretreatment ADC map and dose distribution provided a promising way to predict RTLI in NPC patients receiving IMRT, which can support clinicians in making decisions to develop individualized treatment plans and implement preventive measures.</description>

However, the effect of timely initiation of PORT among the subset of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) patients has not been reported. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if starting PORT within 6 weeks of surgery versus 6 to 12 weeks was associated with improved survival among OCSCC patients. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study reviewed data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004 to 2019. OCSCC patients treated with curative intent surgery followed by PORT were identified. Exclusion criteria included history of prior radiation, receiving PORT &gt;12 weeks after surgery, multiple primary malignancies, or unknown survival time. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was time to initiation of PORT, either within 6 weeks or at 6 to 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) defined as date of diagnosis until date of death or last follow-up. COVARIATES: Demographic data, cancer-related variables, and treatment characteristics were collected. ANALYSES: Univariate survival analyses were performed using the log rank test. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for overall mortality was performed using a set of demographically, clinically, and biologically pertinent predictors. Statistical significance was set at a P value of &lt; .05. RESULTS: A total of 32,743 subjects were included. The mean age was 59.9 (18 to 90) years. Overall, 66.2% (n = 21,691) were male. The median follow-up was 42.6 months (IQR 19.4 to 79.5). Average overall survival was 55.3 months. In the univariate survival analysis, PORT timing was associated with OS when divided into 2 week (P &lt; .001) and 6 week (P &lt; .001) intervals. After accounting for covariates, starting PORT within 6 weeks was associated with improved OS compared to 6 to 12 weeks (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; P = .037). The duration of radiation therapy did not influence OS (HR 1.00; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.0; P = .4). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the NCCN guidelines, the findings suggest that initiating PORT within 6 weeks is associated with improved survival among OCSCC patients undergoing curative intent surgery.</description>

Understanding the roles of ubiquitination-related genes in THCA progression and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME) could provide valuable insights into prognosis and treatment strategies. METHODS: Using iUUCD 2.0, ubiquitination-related genes were identified and subjected to consensus clustering on TCGA-THCA data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified and used to construct a ubiquitination-related signature using Cox and LASSO regression. The signature's prognostic ability was validated using training and test datasets from TCGA. Immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Three ubiquitination clusters were identified among 454 genes. Four prognostic DEGs (F12, FBXO15, FBXW10, and USP44) formed the signature, significantly correlating with survival, immune cell infiltration, clinical characteristics, immune checkpoints, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Low-risk THCA patients had better prognosis and immunotherapy responses than high-risk patients. A stable nomogram combining the signature and clinical characteristics predicted patient survival. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed differential expression of key genes. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies and validates a novel four-gene ubiquitination-related signature as a promising and independent prognostic biomarker in THCA. Beyond outcome prediction, this signature demonstrates significant translational potential by accurately predicting immunotherapy responses, thereby facilitating the development of more personalized and effective treatment strategies for patients with THCA.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen H, Hu M, Feng M, Chen X, Guo X, Guo J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1680008'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1680008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41626166/'&gt;41626166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Lip and oral cavity cancer (LOC) is a major public health challenge in Asia. Nevertheless, a critical gap remains in understanding the epidemiological burden of LOC among young people (15-44 years) in the region. This study aims to analyze the burden and risk factors of LOC in this age group across the four Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Asian regions from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2030. METHODS: Data on the incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and risk factors of LOC from 1990 to 2021 were obtained from the GBD 2021 study for East, South, Southeast Asia, and High-income Asia Pacific. This study assessed the LOC burden among young people (15-44 years) through age- and sex-stratified analyses, evaluated temporal trends via joinpoint regression, examined risk factor contributions, and projected trends to 2030 using the Nordpred age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased across all subregions, with the largest rise in East Asia. In contrast, age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate declined everywhere except South Asia. In 2021, South Asia bore the heaviest LOC burden among young people in the four Asian subregions. India reported the highest incident cases, deaths, and DALYs in 2021, and Pakistan had the highest ASR for all three metrics. Taiwan (Province of China) showed the largest increase in ASRs over the period. In 2021, smoking had the highest contribution in East Asia, alcohol use in High-income Asia Pacific, and chewing tobacco in South Asia. Projections to 2030 indicate rising ASIR in East, South, and Southeast Asia but declines in High-income Asia Pacific; decreasing ASMR everywhere except South Asia; and increasing age-standardized DALYs rate in East and South Asia but decreases elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: LOC imposes a substantial and growing burden on young people in South, East, and Southeast Asia, marked by rising ASIR since 1990 and projected increases through 2030. South Asia faces the most urgent challenge with concurrent rises in incidence, mortality, and DALYs-most notably in the 20-24 age group. Region-specific interventions targeting predominant risk factors are critically needed.</description>

This study aimed to evaluated the cumulative dose deviations resulting from different planning target volume (PTV) margins during tomotherapy (TOMO) using megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) and investigated the feasibility of individualized margin optimization, with the goal of minimizing volume and protecting surrounding tissues. METHODS: Forty patients with NPC treated with TOMO were retrospectively analyzed. Daily MVCT scans were acquired throughout treatment. Using deformable image registration, the dose from each fraction was mapped to the planning CT, and cumulative doses were reconstructed using MIM software. For each patient, isotropic 1-4 mm virtual expansions were applied to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) to generate "virtual" structures. These were evaluated for V100% dose coverage under the accumulated dose. Planned and accumulated doses were compared across expansion margins using V100%, D95%, conformity index, and homogeneity index, with differences assessed by paired t-tests. Dose variations in organs at risk (OARs) were also assessed. RESULTS: Planned and accumulated V100% doses were within 5% for most targets, however, certain virtual expansions demonstrated detectable dose discrepancies. For GTVnx, a +2 mm margin significantly reduced accumulated V100% (96.55% ± 3.04%) compared with the planned dose (99.18% ± 0.73%; p &lt; 0.001). For GTVnd, both +1 mm and +2 mm margins significantly reduced accumulated V100% (99.21% ± 1.17% and 99.20% ± 1.17%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). For CTV1, a +2 mm margin yielded higher accumulated V100% (99.57% ± 1.49%) than planned (99.89% ± 0.21%; p = 0.212), suggesting deformation-related over-coverage. Larger margins (3-4 mm) reduced coverage, though not significantly. For CTV2, accumulated V100% remained consistent across all margins. The +1 mm expansion produced a small but significant increase (99.72% ± 0.38% vs 99.99% ± 0.23%; p = 0.006), while larger expansions (2-4 mm) had no effect, suggesting 1-2 mm may be optimal. CONCLUSION: MVCT-based cumulative dose evaluation provides a more accurate assessment of the delivered dose than conventional geometric methods. Individualized, dose-driven PTV margin strategies may improve tumor coverage while minimizing OAR exposure, thereby advancing precision radiotherapy for NPC.</description>

This report's purpose is to describe the histologic and demographic features of intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma (IMEC) and to add evidence to support a potential relationship with glandular odontogenic cysts (GOCs). STUDY DESIGN: Cases of patients diagnosed with IMEC were obtained from Oral Pathology Laboratory, Inc, at New York-Presbyterian Queens from 1985 to 2024. Slides and clinical information were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with IMEC were identified who had an average age of 58.6 years and a slight female predilection. IMEC was equally present in both jaws. Twelve patients were classified as having low-grade tumors with cystic areas composed of an admixture of epidermoid and mucous cells, 6 cases of which had areas resembling GOCs. Two patients had high-grade tumors demonstrating anaplasia and perineural invasion. One high-grade tumor had areas that resembled a GOC. Four of the 7 presentations of IMEC (6 low-grade and 1 high-grade) with GOC features were from the mandible. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the common and uncommon histopathologic features of IMEC while also demonstrating that GOC-type areas often are seen as a component of these tumors. Therefore, all lesions identified as GOCs should be carefully analyzed to rule out the early development of an IMEC.</description>

Although radiation dose is a key factor, other clinical and demographic risk factors also influence ORN development. Previous predictive models have primarily been single-institutional, limiting their generalizability. In this first analysis from the PREDMORN Consortium, we have aimed to reproduce existing statistical association and modeling analyses on the largest and most diverse mandibular ORN cohort worldwide to allow comparison with previous studies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective multi-institutional study included 3928 patients with HNC (622 ORN cases) from 8 institutions. Clinical, demographic, and dosimetric variables were analyzed to develop a prediction model (any grade ORN vs no ORN) using forward stepwise logistic regression with correlation-based variable preselection. The ORN normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was developed on 80% of data from 6 institutions, tested on the remaining unseen 20%, and externally validated on a matched cohort (58 patients, 19 ORN cases) and a large population-based cohort (2687 patients, 215 ORN cases). RESULTS: Key predictors of ORN were D30%, V70Gy, pre-RT dental extractions, and smoking status. The ORN NTCP model demonstrated very good calibration on the population-based external cohort (Brier score, 0.077; Log Loss, 0.281). Model discrimination improved on a subcohort including oropharyngeal and locally advanced larynx/hypopharynx cancer cases only (AUC from 0.69 to 0.75 and from 0.65 to 0.67 on the matched and the population-based external cohorts, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PREDMORN NTCP model is the largest multi-institutional effort to date aimed at predicting ORN risk in patients with HNC using real-world data. The model demonstrated good generalizability when externally validated to a large population-based cohort. Our observations align with current guidelines and corroborate findings from smaller single-institution studies.</description>

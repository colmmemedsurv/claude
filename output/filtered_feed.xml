      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dai WF, Nguyen L, Liu N, Chan KK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107851'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107851&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41512430/'&gt;41512430&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Nivolumab was the first immunotherapy to have shown efficacy in platinum-resistant recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (R/M SCCHNC) in the CheckMate-141 trial. We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine the survival outcomes and resource utilization of patients with R/M SCCHNC who were treated with nivolumab. METHOD: Patients with R/M SCCHNC were included in the study if they received nivolumab between January 17th 2018 to August 31st 2022 in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), were assessed using Kaplan-Meier. Cox proportional hazard model was used to explore the association between baseline patient characteristics and all-cause death. The incidence of healthcare utilization was estimated using the cumulative incidence function, taking death as a competing event. RESULTS: A total of 498 R/M SCCHNC patients received nivolumab (Mean age 62.9, 78.7 % male). The median OS was 6.0 months (95 % CI: 5.0-7.3) and median time-to-treatment discontinuation was 2.6 months (95 % CI: 2.3-3.0). There is no significant OS difference between older patients (age &gt; 75 years old) and younger patients (p-value 0.73). At 1-year post-nivolumab initiation, the cumulative incidence of emergency department visits is 50.6 % (95 % CI: 46.1-55.0 %) and direct hospitalization is 22.7 % (19.0-26.6 %). CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the survival outcomes of nivolumab were similar to those observed in CheckMate-141 trial. We demonstrated that there is no survival difference between older and younger patients. Furthermore, more than half of patients exaperienced an hospital encounter with the healthcare system, suggesting significant healthcare resource utilization.</description>

The impact of perioperative extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage remains unclear. This study hypothesizes that calculated prophylaxis with piperacillin/tazobactam reduces early-onset SSI in this high-risk population. METHODS: From a microvascular reconstructed cohort, 161 with prior irradiation were retrospectively identified (tumor, N = 101; ORN, N = 60). SSI risk reduction was compared between patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (N = 39) and standard prophylaxis (N = 122). RESULTS: With underlying SSI incidence of 36%, piperacillin/tazobactam showed a fourfold SSI risk reduction (HR 0.24; p = 0.002) across the entire cohort and a fivefold reduction in patients with bone resection (HR 0.17; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses confirmed this effect with a sevenfold reduction in tumor patients (HR 0.14; p = 0.008) and a threefold reduction in ORN patients (HR 0.29; p = 0.04). Extended coverage did not significantly prolong antibiotic treatment times. CONCLUSION: In summary, calculated use of piperacillin/tazobactam in previously irradiated patients requiring microvascular reconstruction appears effective in reducing early-onset SSI.</description>

Despite its high incidence (6.0 per 100,000 males; 2.3 per 100,000 females) and poor prognosis, no molecular biomarkers exist for early detection. Non-invasive sampling could improve diagnosis and patient outcomes. METHODS: This pilot study used RNA sequencing to identify significantly upregulated mRNA targets in swab samples from oral and oropharyngeal SCC patients and healthy probands. After filtering, four potential biomarkers were further validated in 79 samples using RT-qPCR. CombiROC analysis assessed diagnostic performance. Additional RT-qPCR on tumour and normal tissues and fluorescence staining in FFPE tumour sections evaluated expression at mRNA and protein levels. RESULTS: A panel of three markers (c-JUN, SFN, HSP90AB1) showed high diagnostic accuracy: 92.3% specificity, 92.3% sensitivity, and AUC of 0.91. Fluorescence staining confirmed significantly higher protein expression in tumour tissues, supporting RNA findings. The panel showed stronger diagnostic performance in men than in women. CONCLUSION: This study presents a promising non-invasive biomarker panel for oral and oropharyngeal SCC detection. Further validation in larger cohorts is needed to confirm diagnostic value and clarify sex specificity. The approach is adaptable to other tumour types and sample materials, supporting molecular diagnostics. The workflow shows all project steps from sampling to marker localisation in FFPE tissue. In the discovery phase, RNA sequencing was used to find potential mRNA markers in swab samples. Via strict filtering, markers for RT-qPCR were selected and verified in a bigger cohort in the validation phase. Selected markers were then used to do combinatorial analysis to improve the specificity and sensitivity compared to that of the single markers. Finally, markers were verified and localised in primary oral and oropharyngeal SCC FFPE tissue. Created with BioRender.com.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hussein M, Wu L, Soliman AS, Healey MA, Baser O&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-1267'&gt;10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-1267&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41505634/'&gt;41505634&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal and oral cancers (OOC) represent a growing public health concern with significant long-term health and economic consequences. This study evaluated risk-adjusted dental utilization patterns and associated healthcare costs among patients with OOC in Medicare and commercially insured populations. METHODS: Using the 2013-2024 Merative™ MarketScan® Research Databases, individuals with at least one medical claim for OOC were identified and matched 1:1 to non-OOC controls using propensity score matching. Analyses were stratified by insurance type (Medicare vs. commercial). Outcomes included frequency of dental visits, types of dental procedures, treatment modalities, and total annual healthcare costs. RESULTS: The prevalence of OOC was 67 per 100,000 among commercially insured and 397 per 100,000 among Medicare enrollees. Compared with controls, OOC patients were older and predominantly male (all p&lt;0.01). OOC patients had significantly fewer annual dental visits than controls (2.79 vs. 2.98 [Medicare]; 2.81 vs. 3.20 [Commercial], all p&lt;.0001). Restoration and periodontal treatments were the most common dental procedures. Surgical treatment alone was more frequent among OOC patients (20.1% Medicare; 15.6% Commercial). The risk-adjusted total annual healthcare burden was $22,984 for Medicare and $47,542 for Commercial OOC patients (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher medical costs and intensive cancer treatment, OOC patients had fewer dental visits, indicating a gap in survivorship care. IMPACT: These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated medical-dental care models and policies that enhance access to preventive and restorative dental services, potentially reducing complications, improving quality of life, and lowering healthcare costs among OOC survivors.</description>

Its role in reducing postoperative complications in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 415 OSCC patients undergoing radical resection with free flap reconstruction. After propensity score matching, 174 well-matched pairs were analyzed. Patients were divided into a tooth cleaning group (n = 174) and a control group (n = 174). Outcomes included postoperative pneumonia (PP), surgical site infection (SSI), fever, length of stay, and unplanned reoperation were recorded. RESULTS: Preoperative tooth cleaning was significantly associated with lower PP risk (OR = 0.30). Significant independent risk factors for PP included tumor location at the floor of the mouth (OR = 4.70), hypertension (OR = 2.93), and longer operative duration (OR = 1.33 per hour). The radiographic severity of periodontitis was not a significant risk factor for PP. No associations were found between tooth cleaning and other outcomes. Stratified analyses showed significant protective effects in patients aged &gt; 60 years (OR = 0.19), with hypertension (OR = 0.08), periodontitis (OR = 0.07), or surgeries &gt; 5 h (OR = 0.18). CONCLUSION: Preoperative professional tooth cleaning one day before surgery is associated with a reduced risk of PP in OSCC patients.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Adults undergoing parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation between 2018 and 2023 were included. Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 740 tumors were analyzed (353 benign, 387 malignant). Antegrade dissection was performed in 288 cases (194 malignant), retrograde in 334 (167 malignant), and extracapsular in 118 (26 malignant). Transient and permanent facial weakness occurred in 20% and 5% of cases. After adjustment, extracapsular dissection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.7, P = .0058) significantly reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade dissection. Retrograde dissection (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P = .11) demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of transient weakness relative to antegrade dissection. In malignant tumors, outcomes were similar across approaches. Extracapsular dissection was rarely used in malignant disease and reserved for selected cases. Antegrade dissection had longer operative times in benign and malignant tumors (P &lt; .001). Perioperative complication rates, unplanned visits, recurrence, re-operations, ED visits, and readmissions were low and not significantly different across techniques. CONCLUSION: In benign parotidectomy, extracapsular dissection significantly reduced transient facial weakness, while retrograde dissection demonstrated a trend toward reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade. In malignant disease, outcomes were similar across approaches. Selective application of extracapsular and retrograde techniques may optimize facial nerve outcomes and operative efficiency.</description>

However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Manduchi B, Jefferson TC, Moreno AC, Barbon CEA, Whisenant M, Martino R, Fuller CD, Hutcheson KA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111365'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111365&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41506576/'&gt;41506576&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To determine clinically actionable thresholds for the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head and Neck (MDASI-HN) -Swallow and -Choke items by comparing discriminant capacity against imaging-based markers of dysphagia in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing (chemo)radiotherapy (RT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective secondary analysis used single-institution prospective registries of HNC patients treated with RT who completed the MDASI-HN and a modified barium swallow (MBS) before, during, or after RT. The DynamicImaging Grade ofSwallowing Toxicity(DIGEST) overall (D), efficiency (E), and safety (S) scores were compared to a priori-defined (≥6) and data-driven thresholds using binomial regression. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), PPV and NPV, using DIGEST D, E, S ≥ 1 (any impairment) and ≥ 2 (moderate-severe) as reference standards. RESULTS: Among 264 patients (mean age 62; 87 % male; 47 % nasopharyngeal cancer; 55 % post-RT), -Swallow ≥ 6 was associated with D ≥ 1 and D ≥ 2 (RRs = 1.8-2.6, p &lt; 0.05), showing high SP (92-95 %) but low SN (23-30 %). -Choke ≥ 6 demonstrated stronger associations for D ≥ 2 (RR = 3.5, p &lt; 0.05), and similar SN/SP tradeoffs. Data-driven thresholds improved accuracy: for D ≥ 1, a combined threshold (-Swallow or -Choke) ≥ 2 yielded SN 77 %, SP 64 %; for D ≥ 2, -Choke ≥ 1 showed SN 85 %, SP 69 %, while -Choke ≥ 2 increased SP to 84 %. For aspiration risk (S ≥ 2), -Choke ≥ 1 had SN 88 %, SP 66 %; -Choke ≥ 2 improved SP to 83 %. CONCLUSION: MDASI-Swallow and -Choke correlate with imaging-based dysphagia. While ≥ 6 may flag moderate-severe impairment, lower thresholds (≥1-2) offer better sensitivity, supporting early detection. Combined thresholds may enhance screening and guide survivorship care.</description>

This study aims to explore association between occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM) in level II and preoperative clinical characteristics. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed unilateral cN1b PTC patients who underwent surgery (2000-2017), with clinical lateral neck metastasis limiting in level III and IV. The OLNM in level II was assessed with preoperative clinical characteristics using logistic regression model; its association with pathological nodes distribution was examined with restricted cubic spline; the prognosis value of level II OLNM was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. RESULTS: A total of 640 patients (mean [SD] age, 41[11.3] years; 440[68.8 %] female individuals; 307[48.0 %] with OLNM in level II) were analyzed. Primary tumor size (&gt;1.5 cm, OR, 1.625[1.174-2.252]; P = 0.003) and clinical positive lymph nodes (multiple, OR, 4.241 [2.283-8.506]; P &lt; 0.001) are associated with elevated risk of level II OLNM. A non-linear relationship was found between level II OLNM and metastatic lymph nodes number in levels III and IV. No significant difference in all-site recurrence-free survival (RFS) or regional RFS was found between patients with or without level II OLNM, even after adjusting other potential risk factors. CONCLUSION: The primary tumor size and metastatic burden in adjacent cervical compartments are associated with risk of level II OLNM, super-selective neck dissection could be considered in patients with small primary tumor cancer and low metastatic burden.</description>

This study evaluates survival outcomes and prognostic factors-particularly the impact of tumor stage (pT category), histologic grade, and resection margins-in a contemporary institutional series. METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 30 patients treated for histologically confirmed sinonasal ITAC at a single centre from July 2010 to July 2024. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment strategies (including surgical approach and perioperative therapies), and outcomes were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: The study cohort comprised predominantly male patients (86.7%), with a mean age of 66 years. Advanced disease (pT3 and pT4) occurred in 66.7% of patients. The median follow-up was 53 months. Five-year OS was 58.6%, DSS 75.3%, and DFS 65.3%. Early-stage tumors (pT1 and pT2) demonstrated superior outcomes, achieving 100% five-year OS and DSS compared to 41.7% OS and 62.9% DSS for advanced stages (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pathological T category remains a key prognostic determinant in sinonasal ITAC. Endoscopic resection, including transnasal craniectomy when necessary, coupled with risk-adapted radiotherapy, yields favorable survival outcomes even in advanced cases.</description>

A secondary aim was to compare patients with isolated NLM, isolated PLM, and concurrent NLM/PLM. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective multicenter study included 68 patients with nodal metastatic cSCC treated at the Head and Neck Units of Bologna, Modena, and Pescara (2014-2024). Clinical, pathological, and treatment variables were analyzed for associations with survival using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models (IBM SPSS). RESULTS: The cohort included 30 patients with isolated NLM (44%), 14 with isolated PLM (21%), and 24 with both NLM and PLM (35%). At 5 years, DFS was 33.8%, DSS 70.6%, and OS 69.1%. DFS was reduced by extranodal extension (ENE) in PLM (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.65-9.48, p = .002). DSS was negatively influenced by perineural invasion (HR 4.53, 95% CI 1.02-34.44, p= 0.016), NLM ENE (HR 5.60, 95% CI 1.72-18.19, p = 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 8.90, 95% CI 2.51-18.90, p &lt; 0.001). OS was independently worsened by PNI (HR 6.16, 95% CI 1.20-31.39, p = 0.029), NLM ENE (HR 5.18, 95% CI 1.67-16.03, p= 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 7.03, 95% CI 2.24-22.07, p &lt; 0.001). Female sex (36% in isolated PLM vs 3% in isolated NLM, p = .004) and immunosuppression (67% in patients with both NLM and PLM, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with nodal dissemination pattern, but not with survival. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic relevance of PNI, ENE, advanced nodal stage, and lack of adjuvant RT in nodal metastatic cSCC. Immunosuppression and female sex appear more related to higher nodal dissemination patterns than to survival.</description>

This study aimed to assess the severity of FCR and explore the relationships among resilience, quality of life (QoL), and FCR in preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals in China from March to July 2024. The study collected demographic and clinical data, the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), and the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 281 preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. The mean FCRI-SF score was 17.38 (SD = 4.73), with 85.1% of the participants exhibiting high FCR. Resilience, as measured by CD-RISC-10, had a mean score of 23.33 (SD = 3.85), whereas QoL, measured by the UW-QOL, had an average of 58.36 (SD = 8.61). Correlation analysis revealed significant associations among age, sex, first treatment, resilience, QoL, and FCR. Multiple linear regression revealed that QoL and sex were significant predictors of FCR, explaining 40.1% of the variance (P &lt; 0.001). Higher QoL was associated with lower FCR, and males reported lower levels of FCR than females did. DISCUSSION: Preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients experience elevated levels of FCR, which are influenced by various socio-demographic and clinical factors. These findings highlight the need for healthcare providers to develop targeted interventions and comprehensive support systems to address FCR effectively in this high-risk group.</description>

Interventional radiotherapy (IRT, brachytherapy) may provide a function-preserving alternative. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 12 patients with primary oral vestibule SCC treated between February 2022 and March 2025. Eleven underwent high-dose-rate IRT (HDR-IRT) with curative intent after multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation. Clinical outcomes, toxicity, and functional preservation were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients treated with HDR-IRT, ten achieved a complete response. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, nine were alive and disease-free. Two-year disease-specific survival and overall survival were 86% and 78%, respectively. Acute toxicity was limited to grade II mucositis, and long-term sequelae were minimal, with only mild skin dyschromia. No patient developed trismus or Stensen's duct dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive HDR-IRT appears to be a safe, effective, and organ-preserving therapeutic option for selected oral vestibule SCCs; however, further studies in larger cohorts are needed to validate our findings.</description>

P16, a surrogate marker for HPV, is also overexpressed in non-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (non-OPSCC), but its clinical impact remains unclear. This study evaluates the effect of p16 status in non-OPSCC. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of non-OPSCC patients from January 2017 to November 2023 was conducted. Demographics, clinical data, and p16 expression were analyzed. Survival and recurrence rates were compared using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier with log-rank testing. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients with non-OPSCC were included, most commonly in the oral cavity (55.3%). P16+ tumors were found in 21.8% of cases. Median follow-up length was similar between groups (p = 0.724). Tumor recurrence rates were similar (p = 0.377), and p16+ status did not significantly impact survival. CONCLUSIONS: P16 overexpression in non-OPSCC does not confer a significant survival advantage or reduced recurrence.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

Health Literacy (HL) could potentially have a role throughout the HNC pathway. METHODS: Following PRISMA, this review assessed HL impact in HNC. Five databases and gray literature were searched for observational studies. Descriptive analysis and proportional meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 70 studies, 11 met the inclusion criteria (2153 HNC patients), mostly from the USA (n = 7). The Brief Health Literacy Screen was the most used tool (n = 6). The post-treatment phase and quality of life (QoL) were the main outcomes studied. Inadequate HL (11.9%-47%) was more common among men, laryngeal cancer, and advanced HNC, reducing post-treatment adherence and delaying postoperative radiotherapy. Adequate HL was associated with higher education, better QoL, better health-promoting lifestyle, and shorter time to diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: HL influences diagnostic timelines, overall QoL, and post-treatment phase. However, its role in prevention, screening, and survival remains understudied.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to November 28, 2024, was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang using the PICOS strategy. The primary outcome was mouth opening distance. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and methodological quality using the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0) and ROBINS-I. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024613003). RESULTS: The review included 15 articles, including eight randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-experimental studies. There were variations in the timing and type of rehabilitation. Most interventions started 2-3 weeks post-surgery. Three types of interventions, including exercise training, physical therapy, and speech training, improved trismus. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation interventions are often used in combination, but the effectiveness of individual interventions remains unclear. Physical therapy has been shown to alleviate pain, while remote reminders can enhance adherence. Only a basic consensus on rehabilitation interventions can be summarized due to design differences. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous trials to provide more conclusive evidence.</description>

This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence models in classifying salivary gland tumors on ultrasound. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted through January 28, 2025. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in classifying salivary gland tumors were included for fixed and random-effects meta-analyses. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool for systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies was used to assess study quality and risk of bias. RESULTS: Out of 741 articles identified, 12 studies (N = 4721) met inclusion criteria. Nine studies evaluated artificial intelligence models differentiating benign from malignant tumors, and three studies assessed classification of pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors. For benign versus malignant tumors, sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), specificity was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.92), and accuracy was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90). For pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors, sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.89), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.95), and accuracy was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence models demonstrate strong diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound-based classification of salivary gland tumors. These results highlight the potential of artificial intelligence as a diagnostic tool, though broader validation is needed before routine clinical implementation.</description>

We aimed to establish and characterize novel, stable sinonasal NUT carcinoma cell lines derived from the primary disease site to contribute to therapeutic development. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens from a sinonasal NUT carcinoma patient were cultured to establish two cell lines, MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88. Cytogenetic analysis, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the BRD4::NUTM1 fusion. Sensitivity to a BET inhibitor, OTX-015, was assessed via dose-response assays. In vivo tumorigenicity was evaluated using subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88 maintained stable morphology and harbored the characteristic t(15;19) translocation and BRD4::NUTM1 (exon 11: exon 2) fusion. The cells expressed nuclear NUT protein and responded to OTX-015 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Tumorigenicity was observed in vivo, albeit with modest efficiency, suggesting a contributing role of the tumor microenvironment in disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88 are the first stable human sinonasal NUT carcinoma cell lines established from the primary tumor site. They preserve the hallmark genetic and phenotypic characteristics of NUT carcinoma and show sensitivity to BET inhibition. These models represent valuable tools for mechanistic studies and high-throughput drug screening in sinonasal NUT carcinoma.</description>

METHODS: This study was a retrospective, observational study performed at a tertiary care academic center. Participants included patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and laryngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who began pembrolizumab treatment at UCSF between May 2016 and May 2022. The primary outcome was 6-month progression-free survival and 6-month time-to-progression (TTP). The secondary outcome was 2-year overall survival. Disease progression was determined using radiographic criteria, adopted from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with HNSCC were included. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) indication was recurrence/metastasis for all patients. Forty (30%) patients had perineural invasion. On univariate analysis, patients with perineural invasion were more likely to have worse 6-month PFS (p = 0.011). After controlling for number of metastatic organs, receipt of concurrent systemic therapy, age, and PDL-1 status, presence of perineural invasion was associated with worse 6-month PFS [HR 3.33 (1.32, 8.41), p = 0.011] and 6-month time to progression (TTP) [HR 2.14 (1.09, 7.38), p = 0.032], but was not significantly associated with 2-year OS [HR 1.35 (0.57, 3.19), p = 0.498]. CONCLUSION: Presence of perineural invasion is associated with poorer 6-month progression-free survival on ICI in patients with HNSCC. Future studies should further explore how perineural invasion may alter response to immunotherapy.</description>

Identification of somatic mutations and human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences in tumor DNA shed in the oral cavity may provide non-invasive biomarkers for early HNSCC detection. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate TERT promoter (TERTp) mutations in tumor DNA extracted from oral rinses as potential biomarkers for head and neck cancers. METHODS: TERTp mutations (C228T and C250T) were examined in DNA extracted from oral rinses of 132 HNSCC patients, of whom 63 had paired tumor tissue available for analysis, and from four head and neck squamous cell carcinoma derived cells lines (CAL27, SCC152, SCC154, FaDu) by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). TERT gene expression was analyzed in all cell lines by real time PCR. Associations with tumor site, smoking status, and sex were evaluated, and mutant allele frequencies (MAF) quantified. RESULTS: TERTp mutations were identified in 25% of oral rinses (33 out of 132, 95%CI 22.7 - 46.3) and in 27% of tumor tissues (17 out of 63, 95%CI 9.9 - 27.2). Mutation rates were highest in oral SCC (OSCC), present in 50% of oral rinses (n=25/50, 95%CI 16.2 - 36.9) and 46% of matched tumor tissues (n=13/28, 95%CI 6.9 - 22.2), with 96% concordance (kappa value 0.86, 95%CI 67-100). MAF were higher in tumor tissues and correlated with levels in corresponding oral fluids. Mutations were uncommon in non-OSCC cases, being detected in 9.7% of oral rinses and 11% of tumor tissues. In OSCC, TERTp mutations were more frequent in males. The CAL27 cell line carried the TERTp C228T mutation and TERT mRNA expression was 11-15 folds higher compared to non-mutated oral carcinoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: TERTp C228T and C250T are mutually exclusive and occur at a high frequency in oral rinses and tumor tissues of OSCC patients, showing high concordance between paired samples. These findings support the potential of TERTp mutations as non-invasive biomarkers for OSCC detection. Moreover, their higher prevalence in males suggests possible sex-related differences in OSCC mutation patterns.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cavalieri S, Nuzzolese I, Lenoci D, Lucchetta M, Ficorilli M, Orlandi E, De Cecco L, Licitra L&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1678011'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1678011&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41487563/'&gt;41487563&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: The increased expression of LAT1, an amino acid transporter, in cancer cells makes boronophenylalanine (BPA) uptake higher in cancer vs. healthy tissues: a high LAT1 expression on cancer cells implies a higher sensitivity to boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). We explored the LAT1 expression in a cohort of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients, stratifying them according to a previously published transcriptomic 6-cluster model. METHODS: We analyzed 100 HNSCC patients treated with multimodal treatments including radiotherapy. Transcriptomics of primary tumor specimens was obtained by Affymetrix ClariomD chips and processed using the Transcriptome Analysis Console Software (ThermoFisher). We retrieved normalized and log2 LAT1 from the data matrix. Data were used to analyze: i) the distribution by anatomical subsites and transcriptomic subtypes (assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test); ii) overall survival (OS). RESULTS: LAT1 expression was high (&gt;2.83) in 13% of cases. At median follow-up of 64.44 months (95% CI: 54.24-66.91), overall median OS was 94.24 months, 22.99 months (95% CI 14.31-NR) in patients with high LAT1 vs. 94.24 months (95% CI 65.1-NR) in those with low LAT1. LAT1 expression did not differ significantly among HNSCC primary sites. Among GE clusters, the highest LAT1 expression was observed in those with the worst prognosis, the lowest in the immune-reactive one (p=.000028). CONCLUSION: High LAT1 expression has a negative prognostic role and is associated with transcriptomic clusters with unfavorable and radioresistant biologic features. These results justify the use of BNCT in radioresistant HNSCCs and may guide patient selection for future clinical studies with BNCT.</description>

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have reshaped first-line therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease; yet durable benefit is confined to a subset, reflecting myeloid-centric mechanisms-SPP1+ TAM barriers, cDC1/IL-12 insufficiency, and CXCL8-CXCR1/2-driven neutrophil trafficking-distinct from, and complementary to, classical lymphoid exhaustion. In this review we summarize advances from single-cell RNA and ATAC profiling and spatial transcriptomics that resolve macrophage, dendritic-cell and neutrophil programs, and appraise translational opportunities spanning myeloid reprogramming, innate-adaptive combinations and spatial biomarkers. We also discuss enduring challenges-including HPV-status heterogeneity, limited assay standardization and a scarcity of predictive metrics-that temper implementation. By integrating myeloid-informed readouts (e.g., SPP1-TAM burden, cDC1 competency, serum IL-8) with PD-1-based regimens, EGFR-directed antibodies and myeloid checkpoints (CD47-SIRPα, PI3Kγ, CXCR1/2), emerging strategies aim to restore antigen presentation, improve lymphocyte trafficking and remodel tumor-stroma interfaces. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of myeloid-informed precision immuno-oncology in HNSCC and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for clinical translation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.</description>

This study evaluated the predictive value of combining PD-L1 expression and IP in R/M HNSCC. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-one R/M HNSCC patients treated with ICI were included. PD-L1 expression was evaluated using the standardized 22C3 pharmDx assay. IPs were assessed using Lunit SCOPE IO, an artificial intelligence-powered tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte analyzer. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (95.1%) were classified as PD-L1 positive (combined positive score ≥1). Overall, 27 (65.9%) had desert IP. PD-L1 expression and IP were combined to classify patients into 3 groups: group A, negative PD-L1; group B, positive PD-L1 with desert IP; group C, positive PD-L1 with non-desert IP. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.2 months in group A, 2.1 months in group B, and 12.1 months in group C (P = .015). In multivariate Cox analysis, PD-L1 expression combined with IP was an independent factor for PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.14 (P = .018) in group C and 0.37 (P = .186) in group B, relative to group A. CONCLUSIONS: In R/M HNSCC, integrating IP with PD-L1 expression may enhance prediction of ICI outcomes.</description>

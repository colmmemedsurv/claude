      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Riaz N, Alban TJ, Haddad RI, Saul M, Makarov V, Zhu Y, Cohen EEW, Ferris RL, Chang PM, Lin JC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0'&gt;10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482527/'&gt;41482527&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade-based multimodal therapy is widely used across oncology; yet drivers of resistance in most cancer types are not well understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized the tumor genome, microenvironment and microbiome in a phase 3 international randomized trial ( NCT02952586 ) to identify factors that shape outcomes to anti-PD-L1 avelumab plus standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy versus placebo/chemoradiotherapy in individuals with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients receiving avelumab whose tumors contained distinct immunologic and genetic features had superior outcomes compared to those receiving placebo. By contrast, patients with increased myeloid/neutrophil activities had worse outcomes with avelumab than those treated with placebo. Strikingly, these tumors possessed telltale intratumoral bacteria, elevated tumor-associated neutrophils, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and suppressed adaptive immunity. We define tumor ecosystems associated with benefit to chemoimmunotherapy. Our data demonstrate how intratumoral bacteria affect immune checkpoint blockade response within a randomized trial. These discoveries enhance our understanding of combination immunotherapy, provide a useful multiomic resource and identify unanticipated interactions that may guide future therapeutic strategies.</description>

To address this, here we analyzed oropharyngeal HNSCCs treated with neoadjuvant durvalumab (anti-PDL1) alone or in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) from the CIAO clinical trial ( NCT03144778 ). We found that only the total abundance of intratumoral bacteria predicted ICB response, which was validated in multiple independent cohorts. High intratumoral bacteria abundance was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils coupled with depletion of T cells and other adaptive immune cells. Experimental elevation or reduction in intratumoral bacteria abundance in orthotopic models of HNSCC in female mice recapitulated immunological associations observed in participant tumors. Increasing intratumoral bacteria abundance was sufficient to induce resistance to anti-PDL1 ICB, irrespective of bacterial species tested. Together, these findings demonstrate that high intratumoral bacteria abundance is a key suppressor of antitumor immunity and promotes immunotherapy resistance.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang JJ, Reznik AS, Sonis S, Franzmann EJ, Villa A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4766'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4766&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481330/'&gt;41481330&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Innovative clinical trials (CTs) are needed to address the rising incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Despite adequate trial initiation, HNSCC CTs experience high failure rates, and the factors driving these trends remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the characteristics associated with failure (termination or withdrawal) in CTs for the treatment of HNSCC. DESIGN AND SETTING: HNSCC CTs were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2024, and trial failures were defined as early termination or withdrawal. Trial characteristics were compared between failed CTs and completed CT controls. Data were analyzed from June to August 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was trial failure. The association between failure and CT characteristics, including phase, enrollment, funding source, intervention type, and age-eligibility criteria, was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: A total of 692 matched trials were analyzed, including 346 trial failures and 346 completed control trials. The overall leading reasons for failure were strategic decisions (defined as nonscientific, sponsor-driven choices; 102 trials [29.5%]) and poor recruitment (90 trials [26.0%]). The reasons for failure varied by trial characteristics. Strategic decisions were the predominant reason for failure in phase 1 trials, industry-sponsored trials, and immunotherapy and targeted therapy trials. In contrast, poor recruitment was a more common reason in later-phase trials, non-industry-sponsored trials, and trials investigating chemotherapy, radiation, chemoradiation, combination treatments, and supportive care. Temporal analysis revealed a growing failure rate among CTs since 2000. Increased log-transformed actual enrollment safeguarded against trial failure, whereas industry funding was an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, HNSCC CTs were terminated early or withdrawn for a variety of reasons, most commonly due to strategic decisions or poor recruitment. Careful attention to trial characteristics associated with early failure is needed to overcome new barriers to drug development and adapt trial design to common reasons for failure.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dorr MC, Hoesseini A, Sewnaik A, Dronkers EAC, Baatenburg de Jong RJ, Offerman MPJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4838'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481329/'&gt;41481329&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Managing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involves complex decision-making, requiring a balance between optimizing prognosis and preserving quality of life. However, the role of individualized prognostic counseling in the decision-making process is not well known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of individualized prognostic counseling with the decision-making process in patients with primary HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective nonrandomized clinical trial with sequential cohorts was conducted at an academic tertiary referral center. Patients with newly diagnosed primary HNSCC who were eligible for curative treatment were enrolled between January 2014 and August 2018 (cohort 1; standard) and between October 2019 and January 2022 (cohort 2; intervention). Data were analyzed between January and August 2023. INTERVENTION: Cohort 1 received standard counseling from the treating physician, while cohort 2 received additional individualized prognostic counseling through an online prognostic model. Both cohorts were divided into small laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SLSCC) and other HNSCC groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was decisional conflict, measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes included perceived role in decision-making (Control Preferences Scale), decisional regret, treatment choice, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients were enrolled (258 in cohort 1 and 200 in cohort 2; mean [SD] age, 66.1 [8.8] years; 79% [362 of 458] men). Decisional conflict was lower following individualized prognostic counseling for both SLSCC (Cohen d = 0.19; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.49) and other HNSCC groups (Cohen d = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.10-0.58). Among patients with other HNSCC, the largest and most precise effect sizes were seen in the informed, values clarity, and support subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale. Decisional regret was lower at 3 to 6 months after individualized counseling (cohort 2 median, 5 [IQR. 0-20] and cohort 1 median, 20 [IQR, 1-29]; rank-biserial r = 0.15 for SLSCC; cohort 2 median, 10 [IQR. 0-20] and cohort 1 median, 20 [IQR, 10-25]; rank-biserial r = 0.29 for other HNSCC), indicating small to moderate improvements. These differences were minimal at 12 months. An association between individualized counseling and more active or shared decision-making roles was observed in the other HNSCC group (Cramer V = 0.21). No relevant differences in quality-of-life outcomes were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This nonrandomized clinical trial found that individualized prognostic counseling with an online prognostic model was associated with improvements in decisional conflict and decisional regret and promoted a more active and shared decision-making role among patients with head and neck cancer. The findings suggest integrating individualized prognostic information into routine consultations may enhance patient engagement, strengthen shared decision-making, and reduce uncertainty in complex treatment choices.

The goal was to enhance conventional clinical risk stratification and investigate the biological basis of ITH. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included PET scans from 760 treatment-naïve NPC patients. Radiomics features were extracted from the whole tumor (WT), and the intratumoral spatial diversity score (ITSDS) was simultaneously quantified through subregion analysis. After a multi-step feature selection process, both WT and ITH models were developed. Finally, a nomogram was constructed by integrating ITSDS with clinical factors. All models were evaluated using the C-index, AUC, and calibration curves, and their performance was interpreted using SHAP. Additionally, the biological characteristics of the ITH model were analyzed using tissue proteomics. RESULTS: The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts included 480, 235, and 45 patients, respectively. The ITH model showed superior C-indexes of 0.852, 0.792, and 0.757 compared to the clinical and WT models. The nomogram demonstrated the best prognostic value, with C-indexes of 0.864, 0.817, and 0.772 in the three cohorts, respectively. The nomogram effectively classified patients into risk groups for progression-free survival (P &lt; 0.01). Tissue proteomic analysis revealed upregulated ciliary movement, a more complex tumor microenvironment, and impaired immune function in the high-ITH group. CONCLUSION: The nomogram integrating ITSDS biomarkers with clinical factors improved risk stratification accuracy and created a clinically translatable framework for NPC. This approach potentially offers mechanistic insights into ITH and holds promise for advancing precision oncology.</description>

Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is an important predictor of recurrence and survival and therefore plays a critical role in guiding therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of CLNM in PTMC patients. METHODS: Patients from ward A (n = 877) were assigned to the training cohort, and those from ward B (n = 637) formed the validation cohort. Clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of CLNM, which were subsequently incorporated into a predictive nomogram. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified gender, age, maximum tumor diameter (MTD), multifocality, calcification and capsule status as significantly associated with CLNM (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed gender, age, MTD, multifocality, and capsule status as independent predictors. The nomogram demonstrated good discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.724 in the training cohort and 0.708 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and DCA confirmed favorable clinical utility. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed and validated a clinically applicable nomogram that integrates preoperative clinical and ultrasonographic features to predict CLNM in PTMC patients. This model may assist clinicians in tailoring surgical strategies and optimizing individualized management.</description>

While neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy offers potential survival benefits, it is associated with substantial treatment-related toxicities, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and functional decline. Exercise therapy has shown promise in improving QoL in other cancers, but its role in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy remains underexplored. METHODS: This single-center, open-label, randomized phase II trial enrolled 114 HNSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to an exercise group (personalized breathing and aerobic exercise program) or a control group (routine care). Outcomes were assessed using the BFI-C, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&amp;N35, and PSQI at baseline, after 2 cycles, and after 3 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The exercise group demonstrated significantly lower fatigue scores (BFI) after 2 and 3 cycles compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05). Sleep quality (PSQI) improved significantly in the exercise group and worsened in the control group. The exercise group also showed better outcomes in physical functioning, fatigue and insomnia. CONCLUSION: Exercise therapy is feasible and effective in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Early integration of exercise may mitigate treatment-related symptoms and improve tolerance and overall QoL.</description>

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical features of LECSG with a focus on the role of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, institutional pathology Natural Language search tool. REVIEW METHODS: Retrospective review of patients diagnosed with LECSG at a single institution and a systematic literature review. Full text articles in English were included. RESULTS: 285 cases of LECSG identified via literature review and an additional 10 within our institution. Most tumors were in the parotid gland (70.5%). Lymph node metastasis was observed in 28%. Most cases were in Asian or Inuit patients (70.5%). EBV association was positive in 52%, and 87.6% of these were in endemic populations. Treatment primarily involved surgical resection (65.8%), often combined with adjuvant therapy (50.2%). No significant differences in disease-free survival (DFS) or disease-specific survival (DSS) were observed by EBV status. Advanced tumor stage was associated with worse DFS (P &lt; .0001) and worse DSS (P &lt; .0001). Lymph node metastasis was also associated with reduced DSS (P = .04). Independent predictors of poorer DFS and DSS included late tumor and endemic region of origin. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive analysis of 295 salivary gland LEC cases provides valuable insights into the clinical behavior, pathological features, and treatment outcomes of this rare malignancy. The study highlights the potential role of EBV in tumor pathogenesis, particularly in endemic populations, and emphasizes the need for further research to establish optimal management strategies.</description>

Primary sinonasal angiosarcoma is exceedingly uncommon, with fewer than 40 cases reported. It carries a poor prognosis due to early recurrence and metastatic potential, and no standard treatment exists. CASE REPORT: A 33-year-old male presented with a 2-year history of progressive nasal obstruction, later accompanied by epistaxis, facial pain, and headache. Imaging revealed a large vascular sinonasal mass extending into the nasopharynx, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses with bone destruction. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed sinonasal angiosarcoma. Preoperative embolization of feeding vessels achieved near-complete devascularization, enabling safe endoscopic resection with negative margins. The patient received adjuvant radiotherapy and has remained disease-free for more than 65 months, representing one of the longest reported survivals for this tumor. CONCLUSION: Sinonasal angiosarcoma is a rare but aggressive tumor that should be included in the differential diagnosis of vascular sinonasal lesions. Preoperative embolization is an essential adjunct to reduce intraoperative bleeding and facilitate safe resection. Early diagnosis, multimodal treatment, and long-term follow-up are critical for improved outcomes.</description>

Using 2011-2022 South African National Cancer Registry data, we analyzed age-standardized incidence rates by race and sex across three periods (2011-2014, 2015-2018, 2019-2022) using linear regression. Significant increases were observed for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among White females (p &lt; .01), vulvar SCC among Asian (p &lt; .01) and Black (p = .02) females, and anal SCC among Colored females and Black males (p &lt; .01). Cervical carcinoma rates remained stable for most racial groups, except for the annual trends showing a 1.9% increase per year (95% CI = 1.0, 2.7) among White females. These findings suggest rising incidence rates for some HPV-related cancers across racial groups in South Africa. Further research is needed to explore the constellation of risk factors contributing to these trends and to guide targeted interventions.</description>

This study aims to describe HNC incidence and survival trends in Denmark from 1980 to 2021. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, cohort study used data from the Danish Cancer Registry and the Central Population Register to include all HNC cases in the upper aerodigestive tract from 1980 to 2021. Incidence rates were age-adjusted and survival analyzed as relative survival rates compared to the general population. Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) in incidence was calculated using linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 36,626 HNC cases were included. The age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) increased significantly from 7.1 in 1980 to 12.5 per 100,000 in 2021. From 2015 to 2021, oropharyngeal cancer was the most common HNC. Further, oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated the highest 5-year relative survival of 70.1 % [95 % CI: 67.9-72.4]. Hypopharyngeal cancer had the lowest survival (26.8 % [95 % CI: 25.1 to 28.7]). Overall, the 5-year relative survival improved during the study period from 46.9 % [95 % CI: 44.7-49.2] in 1980-1984 to 65.2 % [95 % CI: 63.8 to 66.6] in 2015-2019. INTERPRETATION: Our study showed a continued increase in incidence for HNC alongside an improvement in survival. The survival varied notably across different tumor subsite. Continued research is essential to address these variations and improve outcomes across cancer subsites. Exploring opportunities for treatment de-escalation to mitigate the toxicity associated with current therapies is essential to optimizing long-term quality of life for survivors.</description>

This longitudinal cohort study investigated the prevalence and dynamics of oral HPV infection among healthy adults in South India. A total of 5325 participants were enrolled, and demographic, behavioral, and oral gargle samples were collected. HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected using nested PCR (PGMY/GP) and genotyped by Sanger sequencing. HPV16 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and validated using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios. At baseline, 5011 samples were analyzed; 274 (5.5%) were HPV-positive and 4737 were negative. Among 3792 initially HPV-negative participants followed up, 126 (3.3%) acquired new infections (median 8 months; range, 6-15 months). Of 274 baseline HPV-positive individuals, 241 were followed up: 24 (10%) showed persistence, while 217 (90%) cleared infection after a median of 9 months (range, 6-20 months). Sanger sequencing of 471 samples from prevalent and incident infections yielded 290 (61.6%) high-quality sequences; 284 (98%) were HPV16, with isolated detections of HPV18, HPV66, HPV70, and HPV89. Ten novel variants were identified-nine HPV16 and one HPV89-while remaining sequences aligned with established Indian cervical HPV lineages. None of the 176 HPV16 DNA-positive samples analyzed expressed mRNA by RT-PCR, confirmed in 136 samples using ddPCR. Oral HPV infection among healthy individuals in India appears predominantly transient. Long-term monitoring may elucidate the oncogenic potential of oral HPV in this population.</description>

This study established KUSCC-192, a de novo HPV+ tonsillar cancer cell line, and evaluated its tumorigenicity. METHOD: The HPV status in KUSCC-192 was assessed using RT-qPCR, RT-PCR, and FISH. Aggressive characteristics were compared with other HPV+ cell lines and HPV- cell lines. RESULT: KUSCC-192 exhibited a mixed type with a predominantly diffused FISH pattern and a few dotted signals and lower E2 gene expression. These findings, combined with its aggressive features, suggest that the mixed type may contribute to the poor prognosis observed in 2%-30% of HPV+ HNSCC cases. CONCLUSION: KUSCC-192 is a valuable model to study aggressive HPV+ cancer behaviors. Further research is needed to explore the clinical significance of mixed-type HPV integration in HNSCC.</description>

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed cN0 sinonasal SCC and ONB patients receiving postoperative chemoradiotherapy at a single institution. Propensity score matching was performed to minimize confounding. Survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates, and logistic regression identified factors associated with specific failure patterns. RESULTS: Among 62 eligible patients (36 SCC, 26 ONB; median follow-up 44 months), ENI was associated with a lower nodal recurrence rate (4.8% vs. 34.1%; OR 0.10, p = 0.030) but not with overall or recurrence-free survival (p &gt; 0.05). Perineural invasion was independently associated with worse recurrence-free survival. The association between ENI and reduced nodal recurrence appeared more pronounced in ONB. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small sample size, ENI was associated with reduced nodal recurrence but not with improved survival in cN0 sinonasal SCC and ONB.</description>

This presents an opportunity for early diagnosis and intervention. Method of biopsy and interpretation are not well standardized and novel methods of analysis are now being investigated. METHODS: We conducted a narrative review of PubMed/MEDLINE (last search August 31, 2025), focusing on adult oral precancerous lesions evaluated in outpatient settings. RESULTS: Incisional punch biopsy is reproducible and often provides the diagnostic information needed. However, scalpel biopsy should be considered when initial biopsy is equivocal, depth of invasion is desired, or to minimize sampling bias. Limited studies show improved sensitivity of combining saliva and plasma sampling. Targeted fluorescent imaging may aid in future biopsy site selection. AI has shown encouraging results in both automated detection of dysplasia and prediction of malignant progression, achieving performance comparable to clinically validated grading systems. CONCLUSION: This update serves to further inform biopsy of oral suspicious lesions and provide a framework for future investigation.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multicentric, international, retrospective series of LHSCC patients undergoing induction chemotherapy (IC) within an LP protocol was analyzed. The primary objective was to develop a predictive model by exploiting multiomics data (clinical, genomics, radiomics). Endpoints were laryngo-esophageal dysfunction (LED), response to IC, overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Patients were divided into three groups: group A (no LED); group B (responders to IC with LED); group C (non-responders to IC with LED). Several algorithms (support vector machine, random forest, C5.0, k-nearest neighbors, XGBoost, and naive Bayes) were run and compared in terms of multiclass area under the curve (AUC) score and classification error. RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one LHSCC patients were included (median age 60 years, 72% laryngeal, 80% T1-T3, and 58% N+). Responders to IC were 85%, while 66% suffered from LED. The 5-year PFS and OS were 58.4% and 64.7%, respectively. When comparing the three predictive models (clinical, clinical + genomics, clinical + radiomics), the addition of genomics provided the highest AUC. Then, we selected a 64-gene signature and 6 clinical variables (comorbidities, primary site, smoking, T category, N category, performance status) to build up the PRESERVE model. It showed a classification error of 28.9% and an AUC of 87.4%. Risks of major misclassification were low (group A to C, 1.13%; group C to A, 7.38%). Decision analysis confirmed the efficiency of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The PRESERVE model proved to be efficient and accurate in predicting LED and response to IC in LHSCC. External validation is needed before clinical application.</description>

Our study aimed to investigate the sensitivity and pharmacodynamic value of HPV-ctDNA levels during treatment in patients with R/M HPV-related squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) treated with pembrolizumab in combination with vorinostat (PEVO trial, NCT04357873). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma samples were prospectively collected from 57 patients with HPV-related SCC before treatment initiation and every 6 weeks until disease progression. HPV-ctDNA was quantified by droplet digital PCR. The levels before treatment were analyzed according to the patient and tumor characteristics. Landmark analyses were carried out to study the association between dynamic changes in HPV-ctDNA and progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and overall response rate (ORR). RESULTS: HPV-ctDNA was detected before treatment in all patients (n = 57) with HPV-related SCC. HPV-ctDNA levels correlated with the number of HPV copies in tumor tissue (P &lt; 0.001). Higher levels of HPV-ctDNA in plasma samples were observed in anal cancer than in other tumor types (P &lt; 0.001), and in patients with distant metastases with or without locoregional recurrence than in patients with locoregional recurrence alone (P = 0.02). The increase in HPV-ctDNA levels during treatment was associated with a lower ORR (P = 0.01) and shorter PFS and OS (both P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: These findings reveal that dynamic HPV-ctDNA variation levels during treatment have a pharmacodynamic value and may help monitor treatment response in patients with advanced HPV-related SCC from different locations.</description>

METHODS: Eighty anonymized salivary gland cases from peer-reviewed reports were evaluated by ChatGPT-4o using standardized multimodal prompts and by three oral medicine specialists who provided Top-5 differentials. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy at the most likely diagnosis (Top-1), within the top three (Top-3), and within the top five (Top-5) differential diagnoses, with agreement measured by Cohen's kappa and subgroup analyses by gland type, imaging, and case difficulty. RESULTS: At Top-3 and Top-5, ChatGPT showed perfect sensitivity (100%) and Top-1 86.67%. Experts surpassed ChatGPT at Top-5 (77.5% vs. 67.5%, p &lt; 0.0001), but ChatGPT outperformed experts at Top-1 (50.0% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.0309) and Top-3 (62.5% vs. 62.5%, p = 1.000). At Top-1, Cohen's Kappa indicated moderate agreement (0.55). Experts showed notable variation by modality (p = 0.0174) and gland (p = 0.053). Although initial subgroup analyses found no notable heterogeneity of ChatGPT's performance across imaging modalities, multivariate regression identified gland type to be an independent predictor of its Top-1 accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This first study shows ChatGPT can provide expert-level differential diagnoses for salivary gland disorders, suggesting promise as a supportive tool, though further research is needed to confirm its clinical role. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: ChatGPT-4o shows promise as a reliable supportive tool for differential diagnosis in oral medicine. Compared to experts, it performed more consistently across imaging modalities, although the particular salivary gland involved had a significant impact on its accuracy. Further validation through larger studies is needed for its integration into routine clinical practice.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ebrahim NAA, Soliman SMA, Farghaly TA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09934-4'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09934-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41466065/'&gt;41466065&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Saliva is increasingly recognized as a powerful, noninvasive biofluid for the diagnosis and monitoring of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), serving as a practical alternative to conventional liquid biopsy. Salivary circulatory DNA (ctDNA) detection in OSCC may exceed plasma levels. emphasizing saliva's susceptibility to local illness. Saliva collection is simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive, allowing for regular monitoring. METHODS: Current evidence demonstrates its potential through a wide spectrum of salivary biomarkers. RESULTS: Identified salivary biomarkers include viral nucleic acids such as human papillomavirus (HPV), host-derived molecules such as proteins and cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF), regulatory microRNAs (e.g., miR-21, miR-31, miR-184), and extracellular vesicles containing tumor-specific cargo. Moreover, oral microbiome dysbiosis has been linked to malignant transformation and progression, highlighting saliva's ability to reflect complex tumor-host interactions. Technological progress in multi-omics profiling and artificial intelligence (AI) has enhanced the interpretation of these multidimensional datasets, supporting the design of more robust and individualized biomarker panels. Concurrently, point-of-care technologies, particularly microfluidic chips and biosensor platforms, are driving the development of rapid and portable saliva-based diagnostics.  CONCLUSION: The path toward clinical implementation is constrained by several factors: the absence of FDA-approved salivary assays for OSCC, reliance on relatively small and retrospective studies, and the lack of standardized protocols for collection, processing, and analysis. Despite these challenges, salivary diagnostics are advancing as a highly promising adjunct to established modalities such as histopathology and radiologic imaging. They hold potential in early disease detection, patient stratification, therapeutic monitoring, and surveillance of recurrence. Integrative models, such as liquid TNM staging-which combine salivary and blood-based biomarkers-may ultimately redefine cancer diagnostics and follow-up. To date, no saliva-based assay has received FDA approval for oral cancer, highlighting regulatory and validation shortcomings. For translation into practice, further validation through large-scale trials, regulatory endorsement, and demonstration of cost-effectiveness remain essential. Nonetheless, saliva-based assays stand out as accessible, patient-centered tools with significant implications for the future of head and neck oncology.</description>

We retrospectively reviewed 56 patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the external auditory canal treated at a tertiary referral center between 2000 and 2022. Clinical data including demographics, tumor stage, treatment modalities, surgical approach, and survival outcomes were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards regression were used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Of the 56 patients (mean age 61.6 years; 46.4% female), 30 had early-stage (T1-T2) and 26 had advanced-stage (T3-T4) tumors. The 5-year OS rates were 100.0% for early-stage, 60.0% for T3, and 42.0% for T4 disease. Advanced T-stage, nodal metastasis, and abutment to vascular structures such as the carotid artery or jugular bulb were significantly associated with worse outcomes. In multivariate analysis, younger age, vascular abutment, and nodal metastasis were independent negative prognostic factors. En bloc resection with clear margins was associated with improved survival. These findings emphasize the importance of early diagnosis and meticulous surgical planning to achieve complete resection and optimize outcomes in patients with EACC.</description>

Here, we identify BATF2 as a tumour suppressor whose expression is epigenetically silenced by glutamine in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinomas (HNSCC). BATF2 correlates with type-I interferon and Th1 signatures in human HNSCC, with correlation coefficients even stronger than those of the positive control, STING. The phosphorylation of BATF2 at serine 227 promotes the oligomerization of STING. BATF2 deficiency or high glutamine levels result in higher oxygen consumption rates and metabolic profiles unfavorable for type-I interferon production. An isocaloric glutamine-rich diet abolishes STING-mediated effector cell expansion in tumours, weakening STING agonist-induced tumour control. Cancer cell-specific BATF2 expression promotes an Id2-centered T-cell effector signature, reduces T-cell exhaustion, and triggers spontaneous HNSCC rejection in a type-I interferon-dependent fashion. Utilizing syngeneic subcutaneous, orthotopic, and 24-week-long cigarette smoke carcinogen-induced HNSCC models, we demonstrate that host Batf2 deficiency results in increased infiltration of CD206+ myeloid cells and reduced effector CD8+ T-cells, accelerating the initiation of cancers. Overall, we reveal a tumour suppressor BATF2 whose loss is mediated by unique metabolic cues in the TME and drives cancer immune escape.</description>

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we analyzed US county-level HPV-associated cancer incidence rates from 2008 to 2022 using the US Cancer Statistics Incidence Analytic Database to identify geographic clusters of high and low incidence. Clusters were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic and assessed for differences in cluster-level sociodemographic characteristics and sex-and-site-specific incidence. RESULTS: We found 373 hot spot and 409 cold spot counties, with median incidence rates of 16.14 and 10.62 per 100,000, respectively. Hot spot counties were particularly concentrated in Central Appalachia, the northern portion of the Mississippi Delta, and northern Florida. Compared to cold spots, hot spot counties were more rural (median, 72.02 % vs. 42.09 %) and had higher poverty (median, 17.71 % vs 10.51 %). The largest disparities between cluster-level incidence rates were observed in oropharyngeal and vulvar cancers, with rates over 60 % higher in hot spot counties than cold spot counties. CONCLUSION: Our study identified distinct geographic clusters with disproportionately high HPV-associated cancer incidence. These findings highlight areas where intensified prevention and control efforts, including direct vaccination, screening, and outreach efforts, are needed to eliminate HPV-related cancer disparities.</description>

This consensus paper aims to propose a European surgical practice guideline in this setting. METHODS: Twenty-two experts from European and International scientific societies participated in a modified Delphi process for rating and validating statements about indications, contraindications, surgical outcomes, and pre- and postoperative care associated with TORS for head and neck cancer care. Consensus was deemed to have been achieved when two-thirds of experts agreed or strongly agreed with the statement; those with fewer than one-third agreement were improved and resubmitted for voting until final validation or rejection. RESULTS: Of the initial 41 statements, 38 reached consensus after three voting rounds. Statements propose recommendations for the preoperative assessment (n = 7), indications and contraindications for TORS in oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal primaries (n = 10), surgical outcomes to be reported (n = 7), postoperative care (n = 8), and clinical research (n = 6). TORS is appropriate for small, accessible oropharyngeal and supraglottic tumors with favorable exposure. The contraindications set out in detail for oropharyngeal, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal lesions will assist in decision-making, especially when presented with a controversial clinical scenario. Standardized reporting of surgical, functional, and oncological outcomes, including swallowing, voice quality, and survival rates, is essential for evidence-based practice. TORS represents a promising avenue for therapeutic de-escalation in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. CONCLUSION: The European TORS surgical consensus provides clinical recommendations for the indications, contraindications, surgical and perioperative care for TORS management of head and neck malignancies.</description>

Since the 2007 FDA Amendments Act (FDAAA 801) mandates comprehensive AE reporting on ClinicalTrials.gov, the consistency of these data with corresponding peer‑reviewed publications remains unclear. This study examines the consistency of AE reporting between ClinicalTrials.gov and peer-reviewed publications for HNSCC randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted post-FDAAA implementation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed AE reporting on Phase II-IV HNSCC RCTs registered on clinicaltrials.gov between September 27, 2009, and January 15, 2025. Data was extracted on participant counts and total events for serious adverse events (SAEs), other adverse events (OAEs), all-cause mortality (ACM), and treatment discontinuation. Discrepancies were defined as any mismatch in counts or reporting. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U tests assessed differences in reporting frequencies and publication delays between trial and publication data. RESULTS: Overall, 60 trials met inclusion criteria. All 60/60 (100 %) trials reported participants affected by SAEs versus 43/60 (71.7 %) publications (p &lt; 0.05), of which 33/43 (76.7 %) showed discrepant counts. Likewise, 60/60 (100 %) trials versus 22/60 (36.7 %) publications reported participants affected by OAEs (p &lt; 0.05), with 18/22 (81.8 %) mismatches. Among 24/24 (100 %) trials completed post‑2017, ACM was reported on ClinicalTrials.gov versus 15/24 (62.5 %) publications, and 22/24 (91.7 %) of those pairs differed. Participant discontinuations due to AEs appeared in 17/60 (28.3 %) registries versus 39/60 (65.0 %) publications (p &lt; 0.05); of the 15/17 (88.2 %) with both sources reporting, 9/15 (60.0 %) had discordant counts. CONCLUSION: Substantial inconsistencies in AE, mortality, and discontinuation reporting persist between ClinicalTrials.gov and peer‑reviewed publications of HNSCC RCTs. To uphold transparency and patient safety, enhanced technical safeguards on registry platforms and stricter journal policies, such as mandatory discrepancy checklists, are urgently needed.</description>

METHODS: A total of 161 NPC patients treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were retrospectively analyzed and randomly assigned to training (n = 113) and validation (n = 48) sets in a 7:3 ratio. Radiomic features were extracted from pretreatment T1WI, CE-T1WI, T2WI, and DWI, with features showing ICC &gt; 0.75 retained. After SMOTE balancing, Elastic Net (EN) was used for feature selection to generate EN-scores, and Random Forest (RF) produced RF-scores. These, together with two SVM-based scores obtained from demographic and hematological biomarkers, were combined into an ensemble ERSS (EN-RF-SVM-SVM) model. Model performance was evaluated using ROC analysis, calibration, and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: The ERSS model demonstrated superior predictive performance compared with single-sequence, multi-sequence MRI integration models and LR model. The AUCs of the ERSS model were 0.957 in the training set and 0.968 in the validation set. Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes. DCA indicated that the ERSS model provided the highest net clinical benefit across a wide range of threshold probabilities compared with other models. CONCLUSION: The ERSS multimodal ensemble learning model provides a highly accurate and clinically meaningful tool for early prediction of RTLI in NPC patients. By integrating multi-sequence MRI radiomics, hematological biomarkers, and clinical factors, the ERSS model enables individualized risk assessment and may assist in optimizing radiotherapy planning and follow-up strategies.</description>

We evaluated clinical features, molecular alterations, and outcomes of post-HSCT HNSCC, with emphasis on recurrent disease. METHODS: Thirty-four patients diagnosed with HNSCC after allogeneic HSCT between January 2009 and May 2025 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics, transplantation history, tumor location, HPV status, treatment, PD-L1 expression, and survival were assessed. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. RESULTS: Median age at HNSCC diagnosis was 53 years (range, 6-75), with 73.5 % male. Leukemia was the most common primary malignancy (70.5 %). The oral tongue was the most frequent site (55.9 %), followed by buccal mucosa (23.5 %). Median interval from HSCT to HNSCC was 86.8 months (95 % CI, 72.4-104.7), and median follow-up was 54.8 months (95 % CI, 24.1-85.4). Chronic GVHD was associated with inferior disease-free survival (44.4 months vs. not reached; HR 3.98; 95 % CI, 1.05-15.04; P = 0.044). Among four patients with recurrent HNSCC receiving palliative chemotherapy, median progression-free survival was only 0.7 months (95 % CI, 0.669-0.865). One patient with high PD-L1 expression received pembrolizumab but derived limited benefit. WES identified recurrent TP53 mutations and alterations in PIK3R2, KIT, EGFR, and PIK3CA. All tumors were microsatellite stable with low tumor mutational burden. CONCLUSIONS: HNSCC after HSCT typically develops after prolonged latency and shows favorable outcomes with curative therapy. However, recurrence is marked by rapid progression and poor systemic treatment response, underscoring the prognostic relevance of chronic GVHD and the need for novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Thiagarajan S, Rukmangathan T, Sharma D, Kakade A, Balaji A, Rebeka M, Noronha V, Prabhash K, Ghosh-Laskar S, Pantvaidya G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107838'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41455322/'&gt;41455322&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Patients treated for head &amp; neck cancer (HNC) are at risk of developing head and neck lymphedema (HNL) that may impact their functions and quality of life (QoL). This study aimed to assess the prevalence of HNL, its risk factors, and evaluate its impact on QoL. METHODS: In this observational (cross-sectional) study, we included adult HNC patients who had completed definitive treatment at least 6 months prior and who had received some part of their treatment at our institute. The external lymphedema was rated using the MD Anderson Cancer Centre (MDACC) HNL rating system, and internal lymphedema using Patterson's scale. Health-related QoL was assessed using the University of Washington quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 421 were enrolled, with a median duration post-treatment of 19 months. HNL was present in 190 patients (45.1 %), either internal or external lymphedema or both. Most of them had stage 1a HNL. Factors that predisposed to the development of HNL were age (&gt;47 years) [p = 0.002, 1.993(1.279-2.935)], tobacco use [p = 0.025, 1.864(1.081-3.214)], and the type of treatment received, especially those who received definitive chemoradiotherapy [p &lt; 0.001,9.750(4.063-23.395)]. Patients with HNL, especially internal lymphedema, reported significantly more QoL impairments, particularly related to swallowing, chewing, xerostomia, taste and mood. CONCLUSION: HNL was present in 45.1% of the patients in our cohort, predominantly stage 1a. Age, tobacco use, and treatment received predisposed the patient to develop HNL. Patients with internal lymphedema particularly had swallowing-related QoL issues.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kim M, Lee EK, Kim KJ, Shin SM, Jang J, Shin JY, Jin M, Bae JS, Kim K, Kim WG, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256251409134'&gt;10.1177/10507256251409134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467912/'&gt;41467912&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: The prognostic value of unstimulated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels for structural recurrence in patients with low- to intermediate-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy but did not receive radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy remains unclear. This study aimed to determine Tg cutoff values and evaluate the role of dynamic Tg monitoring in risk stratification in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 9753 patients with low- to intermediate-risk DTC who underwent total thyroidectomy without RAI at 11 Korean tertiary hospitals. Serum Tg levels were measured under thyrotropin suppression (&lt;2 mIU/L) at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively using high-sensitive assays (functional sensitivity, &lt;0.2 ng/mL). Optimal Tg cutoffs were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves and survival analyses. Results: Higher postoperative unstimulated Tg levels consistently predicted structural recurrence, with an optimal cutoff of 0.3 ng/mL (area under the curve: 0.815, 0.772, and 0.816 at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively). A Tg ≥ 0.2 ng/mL, the Korean Thyroid Association (KTA) guideline cutoff for biochemical remission (excellent response), showed high sensitivity for recurrence. Tg ≥ 5.0 ng/mL at 6 months, a KTA-defined threshold for a biochemical incomplete response, independently predicted an elevated recurrence risk. Kaplan-Meier curves showed stepwise declines in recurrence-free survival with increasing Tg levels. Notably, even Tg &lt; 0.2 or &lt; 0.3 ng/mL were associated with recurrence if levels rose over time. Conclusion: Unstimulated Tg levels are strongly associated with the risk of structural recurrence in patients with DTC who have undergone total thyroidectomy without RAI. The current cutoff values of 0.2 ng/mL and 5.0 ng/mL were clinically relevant, and Tg kinetics over time further improved risk stratification. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence from an East Asian cohort and underscore the importance of early, serial Tg assessment in this growing patient population.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Machlah YM, Brandenburg T, Hönes GS, Theurer S, Prinz AD, Hoppe C, Cansiz F, Schulte JH, Kero J, Undeutsch H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256251409070'&gt;10.1177/10507256251409070&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467979/'&gt;41467979&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is the most aggressive thyroid cancer with a median survival of less than six months. So far, no therapies offering a survival benefit are established. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. In general, genetic alterations leading to ATC increase PI3K and MAPK/ERK signaling and include mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases and tumor suppressor genes. They often occur together with the loss of p53, the most prevalent mutation in human ATC. Among such alterations are mutations and rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. Methods: To study ATC and potential treatment options, we generated a mouse model with inducible thyrocyte-specific expression of constitutively active mutant ALKF1174L and homozygous deletion of Trp53 due to a Cre recombinase under control of the thyroglobulin promoter (thyroglobulin [Tg]-CreERT2+/0;lox-stop-lox (LSL)-ALKF1174L/+;Trp53LoxP/LoxP mice, here referred to as Trp53KO/ALKF1174L mice). Moreover, we established several primary thyroid cancer cell lines harboring ALKF1174L and Trp53KO and investigated the effects of ALK inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Results: Median survival of Trp53KO/ALKF1174L mice was severely reduced, and the mice showed massively enlarged thyroids. Histopathology confirmed the development of locally invasive and metastatic ATC. Treatment of primary Trp53KO/ALKF1174L ATC cells with the ALK inhibitor TAE-684 decreased AKT and ERK phosphorylation and induced a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Trp53KO/ALKF1174L mice treated with TAE-684 showed significantly extended median survival compared with the solvent group (66 days vs. 18 days, p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that the combination of ALKF1174L mutation with Trp53 loss leads to the development of ATC. This study provides the first functional data supporting the use of ALK inhibitors in patients with ALK-driven ATC. Our novel ATC mouse model and the derived cell lines offer valuable tools to explore the molecular characteristics of ATC, especially signaling pathway activation and tumor microenvironment, and to test novel therapeutics for the treatment of advanced thyroid cancers.</description>

Information-sharing must be methodical to help patients make informed decisions without feeling overwhelmed by information. Understanding the factors influencing decision-making is therefore essential. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted between May 2023 and June 2024 at two large tertiary referral centers in England, United Kingdom. Consecutive sampling via the multidisciplinary team meetings was used to identify patients newly diagnosed with LRDTC measuring 1-4 cm without adverse features, choosing between hemithyroidectomy and total thyroidectomy, or, if diagnosed following hemithyroidectomy, active surveillance and total thyroidectomy. Clinicians directly involved in their care were approached and recruited, with six consultant thyroid surgeons (five male, one female), and two thyroid cancer nurse specialists (both female), agreeing to participate. All had experience managing over 10 LRDTC patients annually. Transcripts were analyzed using the framework method of thematic analysis. Results: Twenty-four patients were identified, and 19 agreed to participate (13 female, 6 male). Information-sharing was often perceived as a didactic process, leaving patients overwhelmed with complex clinical details. Both groups emphasized tailoring information to meet patients' needs and delivering it in bite-sized portions to enhance comprehension. Key factors influencing individual decisions included a desire among most patients to minimize the number of, and extent of, surgical procedures, the need to preserve the thyroid gland and avoid hormone supplementation, and the patient's ability to accept the cancer recurrence risk. Although autonomy was paramount for patients, providers' recommendations still significantly impacted the final decision. Some clinicians expressed concern that multiple treatment options might confuse patients, instead entrusting decision-making to the multidisciplinary team meetings. Conclusions: This study identified essential information needs for LRDTC treatment decision-making, which can help inform the development of decision-support tools. Multidisciplinary team discussions may need to evolve to allow greater flexibility and support individualized decision-making.</description>

Persistent activation of proinflammatory and proangiogenic pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8), plays a crucial role in tumor progression. METHODS: In this study, we synthetized ruthenium-enhanced curcumin derivatives (complexes 3 and 4) and study their anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties by using HNC cell lines. RESULTS: Complex 3 demonstrated potent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects across both HPV-negative and HPV- positive HNC cell lines, while complex 4 showed selectivity toward oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Both complexes exhibited cytostatic and migrastatic activities. Importantly, treatment with these complexes significantly suppressed NF-kB activity and reduced IL-6 and IL-8 levels more effectively than native curcumin. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight their potential not only as stand-alone therapeutic agents but also as adjuvants in combination therapies for HNC.</description>

However, senescent cells are very metabolically active and secrete a complex mixture of bioactive molecules collectively known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which play a dual role in cancer biology. While the SASP can suppress tumors by facilitating immunosurveillance, it can also promote tumor progression by fostering a pro-inflammatory milieu, stimulating angiogenesis, enhancing invasiveness, and enabling immune evasion. In Head and Neck Cancers (HNCs), a highly heterogeneous group of malignancies, SASP has emerged as a critical player in disease progression and treatment resistance. Persistent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling drives SASP and thereby contributes to the progression of head and neck cancer by modulating the tumour microenvironment. It influences the tumor microenvironment (TME) by facilitating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoting cancer stem cell-like properties, and impairing the efficacy of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors. These effects underscore the need for targeted interventions to regulate SASP activity. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the molecular mechanisms underlying SASP generation and its effects on HNCs. We discuss the dual roles of SASP in tumor suppression and progression, its contribution to therapy resistance, and emerging therapeutic strategies, including novel senolytic and senomorphic drugs. Finally, we highlight key challenges and future directions for translating SASP-targeted therapies into clinical practice, emphasizing the need for biomarker discovery, and a deeper understanding of SASP heterogeneity. By targeting the SASP, there is potential to enhance therapeutic outcomes and improve the management of HNCs.</description>

Homologous recombination (HR), a major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway, safeguards genomic stability via error-free repair. While HR deficiency has been well established as a driver of genomic instability and tumorigenesis in several cancer types, the role of HR in HNSCC remains relatively understudied. METHODS: Here, we analyzed the expression patterns of key HR proteins in HNSCC and investigated their association with clinical parameters, DNA methylation, immune cell infiltration, and patient survival outcome. RESULTS: Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that HR factors are consistently upregulated in HNSCC, in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative groups. Survival analysis identified many HR factors, including ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, LIG1, RPA1, and RPA2, as potential prognostic biomarkers for better overall survival. Interestingly, we observed a significant correlation between HR protein overexpression and immune cell infiltration in HNSCC, suggesting a potential immunomodulatory role of HR proteins. To experimentally validate this association in both HPV-positive and -negative cell lines, we showed that MRE11 and RAD51 overexpression in HNSCC cells led to increased phosphorylation of IRF3 and STAT1, indicating activation of the cGAS/STING-mediated innate immune signaling. CONCLUSION: Together, our findings provide a comprehensive overview of the HR pathway in HNSCC, highlighting the dual role of HR proteins in both genomic maintenance and immune regulation. The consistent upregulation of HR proteins, their association with disease progression, and potential immunogenic effects underscore their promise as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in HNSCC.</description>

However, data from non-endemic areas are limited. This study aims to evaluate oncological outcomes and identify prognostic factors in a large cohort of non-metastatic NPC patients treated at a tertiary center in Israel. METHODS: This single-institution, retrospective study included 181 patients diagnosed with non-metastatic NPC and treated with radiotherapy between 2005 and 2022. Data were collected from electronic medical records and included demographics, disease characteristics, treatment details, and outcomes. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess prognostic factors. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 57 months. The cohort was predominantly male (82%), with a mean age of 51.7 years. Most patients had non-keratinizing histology, 75%presented with stage III-IV disease, and 86% received concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy was administered to 71%, though only 6.5% received the full three-cycle regimen. Nearly 90% were treated using modern radiotherapy techniques (VMAT), and 75% received concurrent chemotherapy. The 3-year RFS and OS were 82.6% and 91.2%, respectively; the 5-year RFS and OS were 77.7% and 84.7%. Age threshold analysis demonstrated that younger age predicted improved RFS (HR range, 3-5; p &lt; 0.05). In the multivariate analysis, patients aged &gt; 50 years had a significantly higher risk of recurrence (HR 6.02, 95% CI 1.30-27.85), while stage IV disease showed a borderline association with poorer RFS (HR 2.81, 95% CI 0.96-8.27), reaching statistical significance in the 30-50 years age group (HR = 7.06, 95% CI 1.14-43.76, p = 0.036). Smoking demonstrated a non-significant trend toward increased recurrence risk (HR 1.61, 95% CI 0.85-3.04). Similar patterns were seen for OS, with age &gt;50 showing elevated but non-significant risk (HR 3.43, 95% CI 0.73-16.06), partly due to limited events. Bedouin ethnicity was associated with higher prevalence and a significantly younger age at diagnosis (39.4 ± 16.0 vs. 52.7 ± 16.9 years, p = 0.004), with a non-significantly better outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In this non-endemic cohort, favorable oncologic outcomes were observed. The age at diagnosis is a key prognostic factor. The higher incidence, younger age and better outcomes among the Bedouin ethnicity warrant further investigation calling for improved risk stratification and personalized treatment strategies.</description>

In this study, a new classification system for BSCC and a corresponding surgical strategy are proposed. A total of 210 BSCC patients who underwent continuous tumor en bloc excision and neck lymph node dissection in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Second Xiangya Hospital were enrolled. In the new classification, anterior/posterior buccal divisions by the front boundary of the masseter and upper/lower divisions by the occlusion line are defined. The corresponding surgical strategies included through-and-through resection, subzygomatic region resection, anatomical unit resection, and mandibular resection. The 5-year local disease control rate, overall survival rate, and disease-free survival rate of BSCC patients were 87.76, 73.61, and 69.24%, respectively. The local disease control rates in the T1-T2 stage group, I-II clinical stage group, and lymph node-negative group were 94.17, 98.80, and 97.50%, respectively. Our proposed BSCC classification and surgical strategy offer another surgical procedure for treating BSCC.</description>

This study aimed to develop and internally evaluate an AI-assisted survival risk score derived from automatically quantified cervical muscle parameters on routine radiotherapy-planning CT scans. METHODS: Pretreatment CT images were processed in a single-center cohort of 65 HNC patients, using AI-assisted automated segmentation to obtain the cervical skeletal muscle index (SMI), intramuscular adipose tissue area (IMAT), and mean muscle attenuation (HU). A multivariable Cox regression model was used to generate the continuous FUNC-RISK score, and model performance was assessed using time-dependent ROC curves at 36 and 60 months. RESULTS: Patient-, tumor-, and treatment-related characteristics were not predictive of survival. SMI (p = 0.006) and IMAT (p = 0.047) were significantly associated with overall survival in a univariable analysis, while HU showed a borderline association (p = 0.087). All three parameters were included in the multivariable model, yielding the following equation: FUNC-RISK = (-0.364 × SMI) + (-0.087 × IMAT) + (0.011 × HU). The model demonstrated moderate discrimination (AUC = 0.734 at 36 months; 95% CI 0.604-0.863; p = 0.002, and AUC = 0.689 at 60 months; 95% CI 0.558-0.819; p = 0.009). Based on the median score (-3.18), patients were stratified into low- and high-risk groups. Five-year overall survival was 71.9% ± 7.9% for the low-risk group versus 39.4% ± 8.5% for the high-risk group (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: FUNC-RISK provides preliminary evidence of clinically meaningful prognostic stratification based on AI-derived cervical muscle quantity and quality metrics obtained from routine radiotherapy-planning CT scans. These exploratory results support the potential role of automated body-composition analysis in personalized risk assessment for HNC, although external multicenter validation is required before clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dong Q, Zhang Z, Li S, Wang X, Zhang H, Bai J, Zheng K, Liang L&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1725848'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1725848&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41458609/'&gt;41458609&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The incidence of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) continues to rise, while current therapeutic approaches remain limited in efficacy for patients with advanced disease. The natural polyphenol Butein has demonstrated antitumor activity in various malignancies; however, its role and underlying mechanisms in cSCC remain unclear. Our previous study revealed that the TWEAK-FN14 axis promotes cSCC proliferation by activating the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways, whereas Butein can inhibit both pathways, suggesting that it may exert anti-cSCC effects by targeting the TWEAK-FN14 axis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether Butein affects cSCC growth by modulating the TWEAK-FN14 signaling pathway and its tumor microenvironment, and to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: Molecular docking predicted that Butein exhibits strong binding affinity with TWEAK, FN14, cIAP1, and TRAF1/2 proteins, with binding energies ranging from -5.8 to -6.9 kcal/mol.In vitro experiments demonstrated that Butein inhibited the proliferation and migration of human cSCC cell line A431 with an IC50 of 43 μM and induced dose-dependent apoptosis. In a nude mouse xenograft model, treatment with Butein at 10, 20, and 40 mg/kg reduced tumor volume by 39.21%, 63.44%, and 79.05%, respectively, without affecting body weight. Mechanistic studies revealed that Butein markedly downregulated the protein and mRNA expression of TWEAK, FN14, and TRAF1/2 in tumor tissue, and decreased serum levels of NF-κB-related inflammatory factors, including IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α. CONCLUSION: Butein effectively suppresses cSCC growth by directly binding to and inhibiting key proteins in the TWEAK-FN14 signaling pathway, thereby coordinately modulating the downstream inflammatory microenvironment. This study provides mechanistic insights and experimental evidence supporting Butein as a potential therapeutic candidate for cSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ahn D, Kwak J, Lee KY, Califano J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.002'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41455480/'&gt;41455480&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Preoperative identification of major salivary gland (MSG) cancers is crucial for determining appropriate treatment strategies. However, whether fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) or core-needle biopsy (CNB) should be the preferred first-line diagnostic modality remains controversial. PURPOSE: This study compared the diagnostic utility of FNAC and CNB and assessed their associations with treatment strategies and survival outcomes in patients with primary MSG cancer. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLES: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kyungpook National University Hospital. Patients diagnosed with primary MSG cancer after surgery were included. Exclusion criteria were metastatic cancers, nonsalivary epithelial malignancies, absence of preoperative FNAC or CNB, or procedures performed over 1 year before surgery. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the biopsy technique: FNAC or CNB. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: The primary outcomes were (1) diagnostic utility (sensitivity and nondiagnostic rates); (2) treatment strategies, defined as surgical extent (partial vs subtotal/total gland excision; no vs elective vs therapeutic neck dissections); and (3) 5-year disease-free survival. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, smoking, alcohol, comorbidity, primary clinical presentation, and tumor characteristics based on imaging and pathological findings. ANALYSES: Data were analyzed using t-tests, χ2 or Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier method with log-rank tests, and Cox regression model. Diagnostic sensitivity was calculated using the final histopathological diagnosis from surgical resection as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 129 subjects were included (mean age, 57.2 ± 15.3 years; 82 [63.6%] male). Of those, 97 (75.2%) underwent FNAC and 32 (24.8%) underwent CNB. CNB showed higher sensitivity for diagnosis of malignancy than FNAC (86.7 vs 45.9%, P &lt; .001) and fewer nondiagnostic results (0.0 vs 10.3%, P &lt; .001). CNB was associated with shorter time to surgery (43.1 ± 28.2 vs 125.1 ± 107.6 days, P &lt; .001), more frequent subtotal/total gland excision (90.6 vs 43.3%, P &lt; .001), and elective neck dissection (53.1 vs 18.6%, P &lt; .001). In advanced disease, CNB was associated with better 5-year disease-free survival (77.6 vs 53.4%, P = .041). FNAC was an independent prognostic factor for treatment failure (hazard ratio, 2.963; P = .040). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: CNB was associated with superior diagnostic utility compared to FNAC, more appropriate surgical management, and improved outcomes for patients with MSG cancer.</description>

However, the precise incidence, specific risk factors, and optimal diagnostic parameters in this surgical context remain unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose pf the study was to estimate the incidence of VTE and associated risk factors, as well as to measure the association between D-dimer (DD) levels and VTE among patients undergoing tumor resection and simultaneous free flap reconstruction. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from September 2023 to August 2025. The sample included patients with oral maxillofacial cancer undergoing tumor resection and free flap reconstruction. Exclusion criteria were osteoradionecrosis, medication-related osteonecrosis, recurrent tumor, or prior VTE. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was the plasma DD level, measured in fibrinogen equivalent units (μg/mL). DD levels were assessed preoperatively and on postoperative days 0, 1, and 2. For the primary multivariable analyses, the DD level on the day of surgery (POD 0) was analyzed as a continuous variable. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variable was postoperative VTE confirmed through imaging examinations, encompassing deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and pulmonary embolism (PE). COVARIATES: The covariates were a set of risk factors associated with VTE, including demographic, clinicopathologic, and surgical characteristics of the subjects. ANALYSES: Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared using unpaired t tests, χ2 tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests, or Spearman's correlation as appropriate. Receiver operating characteristic analyses evaluated area under the curve (AUC) for D-dimer concentration to predict postoperative VTE. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 90 subjects with a mean age of 60.69 ± 12.93 years, 32 (35.6%) were female, and 43 (47.8%) subjects developed VTE. The majority of subjects (32 of 43, 74.4%) were asymptomatic. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that variables such as female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.91, 95% CI: 1.01-8.40), higher Caprini VTE risk score (aOR = 1.90 per 1-point increase, 95% CI: 1.20-3.99), and higher DD levels on the day of surgery (aOR = 1.72 per 1μg/mL increase, 95% CI:1.16-2.54) were associated with VTE development. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed DD cutoffs of 1.74 μg/mL (sensitivity 65.1%, specificity 80.9%, positive predictive value 75.7%, and negative predictive value 71.7%) on the day of surgery and 2.34 μg/mL (sensitivity 79.1%, specificity 83.0%, positive predictive value 79.1%, and negative predictive value 80.9%) on postoperative day 1 for predicting VTE. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The postoperative VTE incidence following radical resection and reconstruction for oral maxillofacial cancer is substantial (47.8%), and most cases were asymptomatic. Enhanced postoperative monitoring is essential. Regular assessment of DD levels may facilitate earlier detection of VTE, allowing clinicians to intervene promptly and improve patient outcomes.</description>

However, the risk assessment of precursor lesions such as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED) remains challenging because of the subjectivity of histopathological grading. We aimed to identify molecular markers that enhance the diagnostic accuracy and prognostic stratification of OSCC and explore the differences in the molecular characterization of OED and OSCC using a few selected markers. Methods: A two-step diagnostic workflow was applied: (1) FISH evaluation of EGFR amplification and CDKN2A deletion to distinguish OED from OSCC and identify EGFR-dependent tumors, and (2) HRAS immunohistochemistry performed exclusively in EGFR-negative OSCCs to stratify EGFR-independent cases. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to assess seven EGFR/cell cycle-related genes (CCND1, CDKN2A, EGFR, PIK3CA, PTEN, TP53, and 1p36 locus) in 117 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (66 OED and 51 OSCC) and 10 normal mucosa samples. HRAS expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 36 EGFR amplification-negative OSCCs samples. Results:EGFR amplification was frequent in OSCC, whereas CDKN2A deletion was common in OED. The EGFR-amplified/ CDKN2A-intact profile showed high specificity for OSCC and improved diagnostic performance (area under the curve = 0.77) when combined with the Ki-67 labeling index. It also predicted poor disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 5.08, p = 0.016) and overall survival (HR = 6.10, p = 0.047). Among EGFR-negative OSCCs, HRAS overexpression was associated with advanced-stage disease and a poor prognosis (HR = 6.15, p = 0.043). Conclusions:EGFR amplification was frequent in OSCC, and CDKN2A deletion was prevalent in OED, supporting their use as molecular markers for differential diagnoses. FISH for EGFR/CDKN2A and HRAS IHC can stratify OSCC by diagnosis and prognosis, enabling practical molecular subclassification, including EGFR-negative cases.</description>

The 5-methylcytosine (m5C) RNA modification plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis, influencing cell proliferation, differentiation, metabolism, invasion, metastasis, and immune evasion. NSUN2, a key m5C methyltransferase, has been implicated in various cancers, but its role in NPC remains unclear. Methods: NSUN2 expression in NPC tissues was explored by bioinformatics analysis, qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Functional roles of NSUN2 in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated in NPC cell lines using CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, wound-healing and transwell assays. The mechanism by which NSUN2 regulates TP53 was investigated by m5C-RIP, RNA stability assays, dual-luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiments. The NSUN2/TP53 axis was further validated in vivo through xenograft mouse models. Results: NSUN2 is significantly overexpressed in NPC tissues, and its high expression correlates with poor prognosis. Functional assays reveal that NSUN2 promotes NPC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and inhibits apoptosis. Mechanistically, NSUN2 negatively regulates TP53 expression by increasing m5C modification at the CDS 1228 site, thereby decreasing TP53 mRNA stability and expression. Knockdown of TP53 counteracts the inhibitory effects of NSUN2 knockdown on proliferation, migration, and invasion in NPC cells. Additionally, in vivo experiments revealed that NSUN2 knockdown suppresses tumor growth in xenograft models, while TP53 knockdown reverses the growth-inhibitory effect of NSUN2 knockdown on xenograft tumors. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that NSUN2 partially negatively regulates TP53 mRNA stability, promoting malignant progression and acting as an oncogene in NPC by downregulating TP53 through m5C modification. Thus, targeting the NSUN2/TP53 axis could be a potential therapeutic strategy for NPC.</description>

The stemness phenotype is one of the main causes leading to tumor proliferation, recurrence, and resistance to standard chemo/radiotherapy. Methods: In this study, genes encoding pluripotency-associated transcription factors, including KLF4, c-MYC, SOX2, OCT4 (Yamanaka factors), and NANOG were evaluated in malignant and non-malignant tissues of a cohort of 54 patients with ITAC, and their expression was related to patient outcome. The c-MYC, SOX2, and OCT4 levels were then confirmed in immunohistochemistry by adding ALDH1A1 as a factor involved in stemness. Results: KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG best distinguished cancer tissue from normal tissue with high sensibility and specificity. Low levels of KLF4, c-MYC, and NANOG and high expressions of SOX2 and OCT4 in tumor tissue correlated with poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), respectively. Through multivariate analysis, type of surgery was found to be a significant prognostic factor along with c-MYC and OCT4. Notably, tumor positivity for c-MYC and ALDH1A1 was associated with longer disease-specific survival, thus suggesting their role as tumor suppressors. Conclusions: Our findings underline the stemness phenotype as a prognostic model for ITAC, supporting the clinical plausibility of Yamanaka factors in sinonasal cancer prediction.</description>

Accurate HPV status classification is essential for therapeutic stratification. While p16 immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the clinical surrogate marker, it has limited specificity. Methods: In this study, we implemented a weakly supervised deep learning approach using the Clustering-constrained Attention Multiple-Instance Learning (CLAM) framework to directly predict HPV status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) of OPSCC. A total of 123 WSIs from two cohorts (The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort and OPSCC cohort from the University of Naples Federico II (OPSCC-UNINA)) were used. Results: Attention heatmaps revealed that the model predominantly focused on tumor-rich regions. Errors were primarily observed in slides with conflicting p16/in situ hybridization (ISH) status or suboptimal quality. Morphological analysis of high-attention patches confirmed that cellular features extracted from correctly classified slides align with HPV status, with a Random Forest classifier achieving 83% accuracy at the cell level. Conclusions: This work supports the feasibility of deep learning-based HPV prediction from routine H&amp;E slides, with potential clinical implications for streamlined, cost-effective diagnostics.</description>

PNI, a high-risk staging feature, has worse outcomes, particularly when clinically evident rather than incidental. Clinical PNI (cPNI) is evident by clinical symptoms (such as pain, paresthesia, or motor deficits) or radiologic findings, whereas incidental PNI (iPNI) is identified only histologically without associated symptoms or radiologic evidence. PNI remains a novel area with varying practice patterns across institutions. Improving risk stratification and tailoring multidisciplinary approaches are critical for optimizing outcomes. Our review outlines clinical practice patterns at our institution, providing insights into managing cSCC with PNI, focusing on diagnosis, imaging, staging, and emerging immunotherapies. A structured search was conducted using the terms "perineural invasion," "cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma," and "immunotherapy." cPNI has a poor prognosis and requires nuanced clinical decision-making. Surgery and radiation remain central to management. Adjuvant therapy offers substantial survival benefit in cSCC with PNI, with improved disease-free and overall survival compared with surgery alone, supporting its use in appropriately selected high-risk patients. Traditional systemic therapies, including cisplatin and cetuximab, remain foundational but have shown only moderate response rates and limited durability in advanced or neurotropic cSCC. In contrast, immunotherapy-now preferred for advanced or unresectable cases-has transformed management, with programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors showing promising results (up to 69% response rate) and disease stabilization. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy may enable tumor downstaging, improve radiation planning, and reduce surgical morbidity. Imaging for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with PNI aids staging and surveillance, but symptoms remain key for detecting recurrence. Our multidisciplinary approach emphasizes personalized care. Larger trials are needed to define the optimal role and sequencing of immunotherapy in this high-risk patient population.</description>

In clinical practice, this invasion is primarily assessed intraoperatively by the surgeon and documented in the operative report, forming the basis of the final T3b staging. Because this evaluation is inherently subjective, its diagnostic accuracy remains uncertain. This study evaluated the accuracy of intraoperative gross ETE assessment and whether misclassification affects recurrence outcomes. METHODS: In total, 4987 patients who underwent thyroidectomy at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital during 2017-2022 were analyzed. Patients were categorized by concordance between intraoperative findings and final pathology: confirmed gross ETE (Group A), intraoperative overestimation (Group B), and intraoperative underestimation (Group C). Clinical characteristics, recurrence rates, and predictors of inaccurate assessment were compared. RESULTS: Of the cohort, 179 patients (3.6%) were judged intraoperatively to have gross ETE, classified as Group A (141 patients), Group B (38), and Group C (33). Recurrence rates were not significantly different among groups (6.4%, 2.6%, and 3.0% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively). Other than lymphatic invasion and tumor size, baseline characteristics were comparable among groups. Multivariate analysis identified age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.961; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.932-0.990; p = 0.009), tumor location (OR: 0.182; 95% CI: 0.056-0.591; p = 0.005), and lymphatic invasion (OR: 0.292; 95% CI: 0.118-0.719; p = 0.007) as independent predictors of inaccurate intraoperative evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Among 179 patients suspected of gross ETE intraoperatively, 21.2% showed no muscle invasion on pathology. Although recurrence rates were similar across groups, recurrence-free survival tended to be lower in Group A relative to Group B, indicating the potential prognostic relevance of accurate intraoperative T3b identification. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm this trend.</description>

This study evaluates oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) prevalence across selected ICPS, including Fanconi anemia (FA), Plummer-Vinson syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, and xeroderma pigmentosum, quantifies risk magnitude, examines age at diagnosis, and assesses tobacco's modifying effect on OSCC risk in these populations. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, including patients with or without ICPS identified by ICD‑10 codes over a 20‑year period. OSCC cases were matched 1:1 by age and sex to controls. The analyses assessed prevalence, odds ratios, age at diagnosis, and the impact of tobacco use. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The prevalence of OSCC among ICPS patients ranged from 0.11% to 4.66%, with the highest in patients with FA. Among ICPS, only FA showed a markedly increased OSCC risk (OR = 40.63, P &lt; .01), while Plummer-Vinson syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita were inversely associated. Patients with ICPS developed OSCC at younger ages (P &lt; .0001). Smoking increased OSCC risk within ICPS (OR = 1.47), whereas nonsmokers with ICPS had a reduced risk (OR = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: FA is strongly associated with OSCC; OSCC also occurs in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Cowden syndrome. Patients with ICPS present with OSCC at a younger age, supporting targeted screening for high‑risk ICPS populations.</description>

Its associations with autoimmune diseases and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), especially among smokers, remain unclear. This study quantified OLP prevalence across 17 autoimmune disorders and evaluated OSCC risk in these cohorts. METHODS: Data from TriNetX research network were analyzed in a retrospective cohort of adults ≥18 years. Patients with one of 17 autoimmune diseases were identified via ICD-10 codes and compared to nonautoimmune controls. OLP prevalence and risk were estimated using 1:1 age- and sex-matched propensity score matching. OSCC risk in autoimmune and OLP patients was assessed via ICD-O/ICD-10 codes, and tobacco impact was evaluated. RESULTS: In 4,480,330 patients with autoimmune disorders, OLP prevalence was 2.04%, ranging from 1.19% in multiple sclerosis to 4.57% in Sjögren's. OLP risk was significantly elevated in 13 conditions (OR = 1.06-2.44; P &lt; .05), nonsignificant for scleroderma, myasthenia gravis, and Hashimoto, and inversely associated with multiple sclerosis (OR = 0.78; P &lt; .0001). OSCC risk was 1.39%, with ORs of 15.93 overall and 23.6 in smokers with autoimmune disorders and OLP (P &lt; .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune interactions in OLP are complex, with robust associations in Sjögren's, vasculitis, Addison's, and intriguing multiple sclerosis protection. The markedly elevated risk of OSCC in patients with autoimmune disease and OLP highlights the need for integrated screening protocols and patient education.</description>

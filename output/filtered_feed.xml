This study aims to explore association between occult lymph node metastasis (OLNM) in level II and preoperative clinical characteristics. METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed unilateral cN1b PTC patients who underwent surgery (2000-2017), with clinical lateral neck metastasis limiting in level III and IV. The OLNM in level II was assessed with preoperative clinical characteristics using logistic regression model; its association with pathological nodes distribution was examined with restricted cubic spline; the prognosis value of level II OLNM was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression model. RESULTS: A total of 640 patients (mean [SD] age, 41[11.3] years; 440[68.8 %] female individuals; 307[48.0 %] with OLNM in level II) were analyzed. Primary tumor size (&gt;1.5 cm, OR, 1.625[1.174-2.252]; P = 0.003) and clinical positive lymph nodes (multiple, OR, 4.241 [2.283-8.506]; P &lt; 0.001) are associated with elevated risk of level II OLNM. A non-linear relationship was found between level II OLNM and metastatic lymph nodes number in levels III and IV. No significant difference in all-site recurrence-free survival (RFS) or regional RFS was found between patients with or without level II OLNM, even after adjusting other potential risk factors. CONCLUSION: The primary tumor size and metastatic burden in adjacent cervical compartments are associated with risk of level II OLNM, super-selective neck dissection could be considered in patients with small primary tumor cancer and low metastatic burden.</description>

This study evaluates survival outcomes and prognostic factors-particularly the impact of tumor stage (pT category), histologic grade, and resection margins-in a contemporary institutional series. METHODS: A retrospective analysis included 30 patients treated for histologically confirmed sinonasal ITAC at a single centre from July 2010 to July 2024. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment strategies (including surgical approach and perioperative therapies), and outcomes were reviewed. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to estimate overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: The study cohort comprised predominantly male patients (86.7%), with a mean age of 66 years. Advanced disease (pT3 and pT4) occurred in 66.7% of patients. The median follow-up was 53 months. Five-year OS was 58.6%, DSS 75.3%, and DFS 65.3%. Early-stage tumors (pT1 and pT2) demonstrated superior outcomes, achieving 100% five-year OS and DSS compared to 41.7% OS and 62.9% DSS for advanced stages (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Pathological T category remains a key prognostic determinant in sinonasal ITAC. Endoscopic resection, including transnasal craniectomy when necessary, coupled with risk-adapted radiotherapy, yields favorable survival outcomes even in advanced cases.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fermi M, Guarino P, Chiari F, Serafini E, Filippini DM, Ferrulli G, Basso M, Mattioli F, Caporale CD, Marchioni D, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09887-8'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09887-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41495506/'&gt;41495506&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study was to identify potential prognostic factors influencing disease control and survival outcomes in patients with neck metastases (NLM) and/or intraparotid metastases (PLM) arising from cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) of the head and neck. A secondary aim was to compare patients with isolated NLM, isolated PLM, and concurrent NLM/PLM. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An observational, retrospective multicenter study included 68 patients with nodal metastatic cSCC treated at the Head and Neck Units of Bologna, Modena, and Pescara (2014-2024). Clinical, pathological, and treatment variables were analyzed for associations with survival using univariate and multivariate Cox regression models (IBM SPSS). RESULTS: The cohort included 30 patients with isolated NLM (44%), 14 with isolated PLM (21%), and 24 with both NLM and PLM (35%). At 5 years, DFS was 33.8%, DSS 70.6%, and OS 69.1%. DFS was reduced by extranodal extension (ENE) in PLM (HR 3.95, 95% CI 1.65-9.48, p = .002). DSS was negatively influenced by perineural invasion (HR 4.53, 95% CI 1.02-34.44, p= 0.016), NLM ENE (HR 5.60, 95% CI 1.72-18.19, p = 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 8.90, 95% CI 2.51-18.90, p &lt; 0.001). OS was independently worsened by PNI (HR 6.16, 95% CI 1.20-31.39, p = 0.029), NLM ENE (HR 5.18, 95% CI 1.67-16.03, p= 0.004), and PLM ENE (HR 7.03, 95% CI 2.24-22.07, p &lt; 0.001). Female sex (36% in isolated PLM vs 3% in isolated NLM, p = .004) and immunosuppression (67% in patients with both NLM and PLM, p = 0.02) were significantly associated with nodal dissemination pattern, but not with survival. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the prognostic relevance of PNI, ENE, advanced nodal stage, and lack of adjuvant RT in nodal metastatic cSCC. Immunosuppression and female sex appear more related to higher nodal dissemination patterns than to survival.</description>

This study aimed to assess the severity of FCR and explore the relationships among resilience, quality of life (QoL), and FCR in preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in tertiary hospitals in China from March to July 2024. The study collected demographic and clinical data, the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF), the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-10), and the University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). Data analysis included descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests, one-way ANOVA, and multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The study included 281 preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients. The mean FCRI-SF score was 17.38 (SD = 4.73), with 85.1% of the participants exhibiting high FCR. Resilience, as measured by CD-RISC-10, had a mean score of 23.33 (SD = 3.85), whereas QoL, measured by the UW-QOL, had an average of 58.36 (SD = 8.61). Correlation analysis revealed significant associations among age, sex, first treatment, resilience, QoL, and FCR. Multiple linear regression revealed that QoL and sex were significant predictors of FCR, explaining 40.1% of the variance (P &lt; 0.001). Higher QoL was associated with lower FCR, and males reported lower levels of FCR than females did. DISCUSSION: Preoperative oral and maxillofacial cancer patients experience elevated levels of FCR, which are influenced by various socio-demographic and clinical factors. These findings highlight the need for healthcare providers to develop targeted interventions and comprehensive support systems to address FCR effectively in this high-risk group.</description>

Interventional radiotherapy (IRT, brachytherapy) may provide a function-preserving alternative. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from 12 patients with primary oral vestibule SCC treated between February 2022 and March 2025. Eleven underwent high-dose-rate IRT (HDR-IRT) with curative intent after multidisciplinary tumor board evaluation. Clinical outcomes, toxicity, and functional preservation were assessed. RESULTS: Of the 11 patients treated with HDR-IRT, ten achieved a complete response. At a mean follow-up of 20 months, nine were alive and disease-free. Two-year disease-specific survival and overall survival were 86% and 78%, respectively. Acute toxicity was limited to grade II mucositis, and long-term sequelae were minimal, with only mild skin dyschromia. No patient developed trismus or Stensen's duct dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: Exclusive HDR-IRT appears to be a safe, effective, and organ-preserving therapeutic option for selected oral vestibule SCCs; however, further studies in larger cohorts are needed to validate our findings.</description>

P16, a surrogate marker for HPV, is also overexpressed in non-oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (non-OPSCC), but its clinical impact remains unclear. This study evaluates the effect of p16 status in non-OPSCC. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of non-OPSCC patients from January 2017 to November 2023 was conducted. Demographics, clinical data, and p16 expression were analyzed. Survival and recurrence rates were compared using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier with log-rank testing. RESULTS: A total of 197 patients with non-OPSCC were included, most commonly in the oral cavity (55.3%). P16+ tumors were found in 21.8% of cases. Median follow-up length was similar between groups (p = 0.724). Tumor recurrence rates were similar (p = 0.377), and p16+ status did not significantly impact survival. CONCLUSIONS: P16 overexpression in non-OPSCC does not confer a significant survival advantage or reduced recurrence.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

Health Literacy (HL) could potentially have a role throughout the HNC pathway. METHODS: Following PRISMA, this review assessed HL impact in HNC. Five databases and gray literature were searched for observational studies. Descriptive analysis and proportional meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Of the 70 studies, 11 met the inclusion criteria (2153 HNC patients), mostly from the USA (n = 7). The Brief Health Literacy Screen was the most used tool (n = 6). The post-treatment phase and quality of life (QoL) were the main outcomes studied. Inadequate HL (11.9%-47%) was more common among men, laryngeal cancer, and advanced HNC, reducing post-treatment adherence and delaying postoperative radiotherapy. Adequate HL was associated with higher education, better QoL, better health-promoting lifestyle, and shorter time to diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: HL influences diagnostic timelines, overall QoL, and post-treatment phase. However, its role in prevention, screening, and survival remains understudied.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to November 28, 2024, was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang using the PICOS strategy. The primary outcome was mouth opening distance. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and methodological quality using the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0) and ROBINS-I. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024613003). RESULTS: The review included 15 articles, including eight randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-experimental studies. There were variations in the timing and type of rehabilitation. Most interventions started 2-3 weeks post-surgery. Three types of interventions, including exercise training, physical therapy, and speech training, improved trismus. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation interventions are often used in combination, but the effectiveness of individual interventions remains unclear. Physical therapy has been shown to alleviate pain, while remote reminders can enhance adherence. Only a basic consensus on rehabilitation interventions can be summarized due to design differences. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous trials to provide more conclusive evidence.</description>

This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence models in classifying salivary gland tumors on ultrasound. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted through January 28, 2025. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in classifying salivary gland tumors were included for fixed and random-effects meta-analyses. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool for systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies was used to assess study quality and risk of bias. RESULTS: Out of 741 articles identified, 12 studies (N = 4721) met inclusion criteria. Nine studies evaluated artificial intelligence models differentiating benign from malignant tumors, and three studies assessed classification of pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors. For benign versus malignant tumors, sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), specificity was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.92), and accuracy was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90). For pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors, sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.89), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.95), and accuracy was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence models demonstrate strong diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound-based classification of salivary gland tumors. These results highlight the potential of artificial intelligence as a diagnostic tool, though broader validation is needed before routine clinical implementation.</description>

We aimed to establish and characterize novel, stable sinonasal NUT carcinoma cell lines derived from the primary disease site to contribute to therapeutic development. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Tumor specimens from a sinonasal NUT carcinoma patient were cultured to establish two cell lines, MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88. Cytogenetic analysis, immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of the BRD4::NUTM1 fusion. Sensitivity to a BET inhibitor, OTX-015, was assessed via dose-response assays. In vivo tumorigenicity was evaluated using subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88 maintained stable morphology and harbored the characteristic t(15;19) translocation and BRD4::NUTM1 (exon 11: exon 2) fusion. The cells expressed nuclear NUT protein and responded to OTX-015 with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. Tumorigenicity was observed in vivo, albeit with modest efficiency, suggesting a contributing role of the tumor microenvironment in disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: MDA-NUT87 and MDA-NUT88 are the first stable human sinonasal NUT carcinoma cell lines established from the primary tumor site. They preserve the hallmark genetic and phenotypic characteristics of NUT carcinoma and show sensitivity to BET inhibition. These models represent valuable tools for mechanistic studies and high-throughput drug screening in sinonasal NUT carcinoma.</description>

METHODS: This study was a retrospective, observational study performed at a tertiary care academic center. Participants included patients with oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and laryngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma who began pembrolizumab treatment at UCSF between May 2016 and May 2022. The primary outcome was 6-month progression-free survival and 6-month time-to-progression (TTP). The secondary outcome was 2-year overall survival. Disease progression was determined using radiographic criteria, adopted from the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-three patients with HNSCC were included. Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) indication was recurrence/metastasis for all patients. Forty (30%) patients had perineural invasion. On univariate analysis, patients with perineural invasion were more likely to have worse 6-month PFS (p = 0.011). After controlling for number of metastatic organs, receipt of concurrent systemic therapy, age, and PDL-1 status, presence of perineural invasion was associated with worse 6-month PFS [HR 3.33 (1.32, 8.41), p = 0.011] and 6-month time to progression (TTP) [HR 2.14 (1.09, 7.38), p = 0.032], but was not significantly associated with 2-year OS [HR 1.35 (0.57, 3.19), p = 0.498]. CONCLUSION: Presence of perineural invasion is associated with poorer 6-month progression-free survival on ICI in patients with HNSCC. Future studies should further explore how perineural invasion may alter response to immunotherapy.</description>

Here, we comprehensively characterized the tumor genome, microenvironment and microbiome in a phase 3 international randomized trial ( NCT02952586 ) to identify factors that shape outcomes to anti-PD-L1 avelumab plus standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy versus placebo/chemoradiotherapy in individuals with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients receiving avelumab whose tumors contained distinct immunologic and genetic features had superior outcomes compared to those receiving placebo. By contrast, patients with increased myeloid/neutrophil activities had worse outcomes with avelumab than those treated with placebo. Strikingly, these tumors possessed telltale intratumoral bacteria, elevated tumor-associated neutrophils, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and suppressed adaptive immunity. We define tumor ecosystems associated with benefit to chemoimmunotherapy. Our data demonstrate how intratumoral bacteria affect immune checkpoint blockade response within a randomized trial. These discoveries enhance our understanding of combination immunotherapy, provide a useful multiomic resource and identify unanticipated interactions that may guide future therapeutic strategies.</description>

To address this, here we analyzed oropharyngeal HNSCCs treated with neoadjuvant durvalumab (anti-PDL1) alone or in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) from the CIAO clinical trial ( NCT03144778 ). We found that only the total abundance of intratumoral bacteria predicted ICB response, which was validated in multiple independent cohorts. High intratumoral bacteria abundance was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils coupled with depletion of T cells and other adaptive immune cells. Experimental elevation or reduction in intratumoral bacteria abundance in orthotopic models of HNSCC in female mice recapitulated immunological associations observed in participant tumors. Increasing intratumoral bacteria abundance was sufficient to induce resistance to anti-PDL1 ICB, irrespective of bacterial species tested. Together, these findings demonstrate that high intratumoral bacteria abundance is a key suppressor of antitumor immunity and promotes immunotherapy resistance.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang JJ, Reznik AS, Sonis S, Franzmann EJ, Villa A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4766'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4766&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481330/'&gt;41481330&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Innovative clinical trials (CTs) are needed to address the rising incidence of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Despite adequate trial initiation, HNSCC CTs experience high failure rates, and the factors driving these trends remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the characteristics associated with failure (termination or withdrawal) in CTs for the treatment of HNSCC. DESIGN AND SETTING: HNSCC CTs were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2024, and trial failures were defined as early termination or withdrawal. Trial characteristics were compared between failed CTs and completed CT controls. Data were analyzed from June to August 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was trial failure. The association between failure and CT characteristics, including phase, enrollment, funding source, intervention type, and age-eligibility criteria, was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multivariable regression models. RESULTS: A total of 692 matched trials were analyzed, including 346 trial failures and 346 completed control trials. The overall leading reasons for failure were strategic decisions (defined as nonscientific, sponsor-driven choices; 102 trials [29.5%]) and poor recruitment (90 trials [26.0%]). The reasons for failure varied by trial characteristics. Strategic decisions were the predominant reason for failure in phase 1 trials, industry-sponsored trials, and immunotherapy and targeted therapy trials. In contrast, poor recruitment was a more common reason in later-phase trials, non-industry-sponsored trials, and trials investigating chemotherapy, radiation, chemoradiation, combination treatments, and supportive care. Temporal analysis revealed a growing failure rate among CTs since 2000. Increased log-transformed actual enrollment safeguarded against trial failure, whereas industry funding was an independent risk factor. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, HNSCC CTs were terminated early or withdrawn for a variety of reasons, most commonly due to strategic decisions or poor recruitment. Careful attention to trial characteristics associated with early failure is needed to overcome new barriers to drug development and adapt trial design to common reasons for failure.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dorr MC, Hoesseini A, Sewnaik A, Dronkers EAC, Baatenburg de Jong RJ, Offerman MPJ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4838'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481329/'&gt;41481329&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Managing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) involves complex decision-making, requiring a balance between optimizing prognosis and preserving quality of life. However, the role of individualized prognostic counseling in the decision-making process is not well known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of individualized prognostic counseling with the decision-making process in patients with primary HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective nonrandomized clinical trial with sequential cohorts was conducted at an academic tertiary referral center. Patients with newly diagnosed primary HNSCC who were eligible for curative treatment were enrolled between January 2014 and August 2018 (cohort 1; standard) and between October 2019 and January 2022 (cohort 2; intervention). Data were analyzed between January and August 2023. INTERVENTION: Cohort 1 received standard counseling from the treating physician, while cohort 2 received additional individualized prognostic counseling through an online prognostic model. Both cohorts were divided into small laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SLSCC) and other HNSCC groups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was decisional conflict, measured using the Decisional Conflict Scale. Secondary outcomes included perceived role in decision-making (Control Preferences Scale), decisional regret, treatment choice, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients were enrolled (258 in cohort 1 and 200 in cohort 2; mean [SD] age, 66.1 [8.8] years; 79% [362 of 458] men). Decisional conflict was lower following individualized prognostic counseling for both SLSCC (Cohen d = 0.19; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.49) and other HNSCC groups (Cohen d = 0.34; 95% CI, 0.10-0.58). Among patients with other HNSCC, the largest and most precise effect sizes were seen in the informed, values clarity, and support subscales of the Decisional Conflict Scale. Decisional regret was lower at 3 to 6 months after individualized counseling (cohort 2 median, 5 [IQR. 0-20] and cohort 1 median, 20 [IQR, 1-29]; rank-biserial r = 0.15 for SLSCC; cohort 2 median, 10 [IQR. 0-20] and cohort 1 median, 20 [IQR, 10-25]; rank-biserial r = 0.29 for other HNSCC), indicating small to moderate improvements. These differences were minimal at 12 months. An association between individualized counseling and more active or shared decision-making roles was observed in the other HNSCC group (Cramer V = 0.21). No relevant differences in quality-of-life outcomes were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This nonrandomized clinical trial found that individualized prognostic counseling with an online prognostic model was associated with improvements in decisional conflict and decisional regret and promoted a more active and shared decision-making role among patients with head and neck cancer. The findings suggest integrating individualized prognostic information into routine consultations may enhance patient engagement, strengthen shared decision-making, and reduce uncertainty in complex treatment choices.

The goal was to enhance conventional clinical risk stratification and investigate the biological basis of ITH. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included PET scans from 760 treatment-naïve NPC patients. Radiomics features were extracted from the whole tumor (WT), and the intratumoral spatial diversity score (ITSDS) was simultaneously quantified through subregion analysis. After a multi-step feature selection process, both WT and ITH models were developed. Finally, a nomogram was constructed by integrating ITSDS with clinical factors. All models were evaluated using the C-index, AUC, and calibration curves, and their performance was interpreted using SHAP. Additionally, the biological characteristics of the ITH model were analyzed using tissue proteomics. RESULTS: The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts included 480, 235, and 45 patients, respectively. The ITH model showed superior C-indexes of 0.852, 0.792, and 0.757 compared to the clinical and WT models. The nomogram demonstrated the best prognostic value, with C-indexes of 0.864, 0.817, and 0.772 in the three cohorts, respectively. The nomogram effectively classified patients into risk groups for progression-free survival (P &lt; 0.01). Tissue proteomic analysis revealed upregulated ciliary movement, a more complex tumor microenvironment, and impaired immune function in the high-ITH group. CONCLUSION: The nomogram integrating ITSDS biomarkers with clinical factors improved risk stratification accuracy and created a clinically translatable framework for NPC. This approach potentially offers mechanistic insights into ITH and holds promise for advancing precision oncology.</description>

Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is an important predictor of recurrence and survival and therefore plays a critical role in guiding therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of CLNM in PTMC patients. METHODS: Patients from ward A (n = 877) were assigned to the training cohort, and those from ward B (n = 637) formed the validation cohort. Clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of CLNM, which were subsequently incorporated into a predictive nomogram. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified gender, age, maximum tumor diameter (MTD), multifocality, calcification and capsule status as significantly associated with CLNM (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed gender, age, MTD, multifocality, and capsule status as independent predictors. The nomogram demonstrated good discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.724 in the training cohort and 0.708 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and DCA confirmed favorable clinical utility. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed and validated a clinically applicable nomogram that integrates preoperative clinical and ultrasonographic features to predict CLNM in PTMC patients. This model may assist clinicians in tailoring surgical strategies and optimizing individualized management.</description>

While neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy offers potential survival benefits, it is associated with substantial treatment-related toxicities, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and functional decline. Exercise therapy has shown promise in improving QoL in other cancers, but its role in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy remains underexplored. METHODS: This single-center, open-label, randomized phase II trial enrolled 114 HNSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to an exercise group (personalized breathing and aerobic exercise program) or a control group (routine care). Outcomes were assessed using the BFI-C, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&amp;N35, and PSQI at baseline, after 2 cycles, and after 3 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The exercise group demonstrated significantly lower fatigue scores (BFI) after 2 and 3 cycles compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05). Sleep quality (PSQI) improved significantly in the exercise group and worsened in the control group. The exercise group also showed better outcomes in physical functioning, fatigue and insomnia. CONCLUSION: Exercise therapy is feasible and effective in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Early integration of exercise may mitigate treatment-related symptoms and improve tolerance and overall QoL.</description>

Identification of somatic mutations and human papillomavirus (HPV) sequences in tumor DNA shed in the oral cavity may provide non-invasive biomarkers for early HNSCC detection. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to evaluate TERT promoter (TERTp) mutations in tumor DNA extracted from oral rinses as potential biomarkers for head and neck cancers. METHODS: TERTp mutations (C228T and C250T) were examined in DNA extracted from oral rinses of 132 HNSCC patients, of whom 63 had paired tumor tissue available for analysis, and from four head and neck squamous cell carcinoma derived cells lines (CAL27, SCC152, SCC154, FaDu) by using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). TERT gene expression was analyzed in all cell lines by real time PCR. Associations with tumor site, smoking status, and sex were evaluated, and mutant allele frequencies (MAF) quantified. RESULTS: TERTp mutations were identified in 25% of oral rinses (33 out of 132, 95%CI 22.7 - 46.3) and in 27% of tumor tissues (17 out of 63, 95%CI 9.9 - 27.2). Mutation rates were highest in oral SCC (OSCC), present in 50% of oral rinses (n=25/50, 95%CI 16.2 - 36.9) and 46% of matched tumor tissues (n=13/28, 95%CI 6.9 - 22.2), with 96% concordance (kappa value 0.86, 95%CI 67-100). MAF were higher in tumor tissues and correlated with levels in corresponding oral fluids. Mutations were uncommon in non-OSCC cases, being detected in 9.7% of oral rinses and 11% of tumor tissues. In OSCC, TERTp mutations were more frequent in males. The CAL27 cell line carried the TERTp C228T mutation and TERT mRNA expression was 11-15 folds higher compared to non-mutated oral carcinoma cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: TERTp C228T and C250T are mutually exclusive and occur at a high frequency in oral rinses and tumor tissues of OSCC patients, showing high concordance between paired samples. These findings support the potential of TERTp mutations as non-invasive biomarkers for OSCC detection. Moreover, their higher prevalence in males suggests possible sex-related differences in OSCC mutation patterns.</description>

We explored the LAT1 expression in a cohort of head and neck cancer (HNSCC) patients, stratifying them according to a previously published transcriptomic 6-cluster model. METHODS: We analyzed 100 HNSCC patients treated with multimodal treatments including radiotherapy. Transcriptomics of primary tumor specimens was obtained by Affymetrix ClariomD chips and processed using the Transcriptome Analysis Console Software (ThermoFisher). We retrieved normalized and log2 LAT1 from the data matrix. Data were used to analyze: i) the distribution by anatomical subsites and transcriptomic subtypes (assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test); ii) overall survival (OS). RESULTS: LAT1 expression was high (&gt;2.83) in 13% of cases. At median follow-up of 64.44 months (95% CI: 54.24-66.91), overall median OS was 94.24 months, 22.99 months (95% CI 14.31-NR) in patients with high LAT1 vs. 94.24 months (95% CI 65.1-NR) in those with low LAT1. LAT1 expression did not differ significantly among HNSCC primary sites. Among GE clusters, the highest LAT1 expression was observed in those with the worst prognosis, the lowest in the immune-reactive one (p=.000028). CONCLUSION: High LAT1 expression has a negative prognostic role and is associated with transcriptomic clusters with unfavorable and radioresistant biologic features. These results justify the use of BNCT in radioresistant HNSCCs and may guide patient selection for future clinical studies with BNCT.</description>

Immune-checkpoint inhibitors have reshaped first-line therapy for recurrent/metastatic disease; yet durable benefit is confined to a subset, reflecting myeloid-centric mechanisms-SPP1+ TAM barriers, cDC1/IL-12 insufficiency, and CXCL8-CXCR1/2-driven neutrophil trafficking-distinct from, and complementary to, classical lymphoid exhaustion. In this review we summarize advances from single-cell RNA and ATAC profiling and spatial transcriptomics that resolve macrophage, dendritic-cell and neutrophil programs, and appraise translational opportunities spanning myeloid reprogramming, innate-adaptive combinations and spatial biomarkers. We also discuss enduring challenges-including HPV-status heterogeneity, limited assay standardization and a scarcity of predictive metrics-that temper implementation. By integrating myeloid-informed readouts (e.g., SPP1-TAM burden, cDC1 competency, serum IL-8) with PD-1-based regimens, EGFR-directed antibodies and myeloid checkpoints (CD47-SIRPα, PI3Kγ, CXCR1/2), emerging strategies aim to restore antigen presentation, improve lymphocyte trafficking and remodel tumor-stroma interfaces. Our synthesis provides an appraisal of the evolving landscape of myeloid-informed precision immuno-oncology in HNSCC and outlines pragmatic standards and avenues for clinical translation. We hope these insights will assist researchers and clinicians as they endeavor to implement more effective, individualized regimens.</description>

Persistent activation of proinflammatory and proangiogenic pathways, including nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 8 (IL-8), plays a crucial role in tumor progression. METHODS: In this study, we synthetized ruthenium-enhanced curcumin derivatives (complexes 3 and 4) and study their anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties by using HNC cell lines. RESULTS: Complex 3 demonstrated potent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects across both HPV-negative and HPV- positive HNC cell lines, while complex 4 showed selectivity toward oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Both complexes exhibited cytostatic and migrastatic activities. Importantly, treatment with these complexes significantly suppressed NF-kB activity and reduced IL-6 and IL-8 levels more effectively than native curcumin. DISCUSSION: These findings highlight their potential not only as stand-alone therapeutic agents but also as adjuvants in combination therapies for HNC.</description>

This study evaluated the predictive value of combining PD-L1 expression and IP in R/M HNSCC. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-one R/M HNSCC patients treated with ICI were included. PD-L1 expression was evaluated using the standardized 22C3 pharmDx assay. IPs were assessed using Lunit SCOPE IO, an artificial intelligence-powered tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte analyzer. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients (95.1%) were classified as PD-L1 positive (combined positive score ≥1). Overall, 27 (65.9%) had desert IP. PD-L1 expression and IP were combined to classify patients into 3 groups: group A, negative PD-L1; group B, positive PD-L1 with desert IP; group C, positive PD-L1 with non-desert IP. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.2 months in group A, 2.1 months in group B, and 12.1 months in group C (P = .015). In multivariate Cox analysis, PD-L1 expression combined with IP was an independent factor for PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.14 (P = .018) in group C and 0.37 (P = .186) in group B, relative to group A. CONCLUSIONS: In R/M HNSCC, integrating IP with PD-L1 expression may enhance prediction of ICI outcomes.</description>

This study evaluates oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) prevalence across selected ICPS, including Fanconi anemia (FA), Plummer-Vinson syndrome, Cowden syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, dyskeratosis congenita, and xeroderma pigmentosum, quantifies risk magnitude, examines age at diagnosis, and assesses tobacco's modifying effect on OSCC risk in these populations. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network, including patients with or without ICPS identified by ICD‑10 codes over a 20‑year period. OSCC cases were matched 1:1 by age and sex to controls. The analyses assessed prevalence, odds ratios, age at diagnosis, and the impact of tobacco use. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The prevalence of OSCC among ICPS patients ranged from 0.11% to 4.66%, with the highest in patients with FA. Among ICPS, only FA showed a markedly increased OSCC risk (OR = 40.63, P &lt; .01), while Plummer-Vinson syndrome and dyskeratosis congenita were inversely associated. Patients with ICPS developed OSCC at younger ages (P &lt; .0001). Smoking increased OSCC risk within ICPS (OR = 1.47), whereas nonsmokers with ICPS had a reduced risk (OR = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: FA is strongly associated with OSCC; OSCC also occurs in Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Cowden syndrome. Patients with ICPS present with OSCC at a younger age, supporting targeted screening for high‑risk ICPS populations.</description>

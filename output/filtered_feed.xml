To establish a theoretical foundation for THCA immunotherapy, we investigated the association between genetic mutations and tumor microenvironment (TME) by analyzing RNA-sequencing data and somatic mutation profiles from 571 THCA samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The ESTIMATE algorithm was first applied to calculate ImmuneScores and StromalScores. Samples were subsequently stratified into immune-high and immune-low groups, as well as stromal-high and stromal-low groups, based on median score thresholds. We then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially mutated genes (DMGs). Significant disparities in mutation frequencies of BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS were observed both between immune stratification groups (high vs low) and stromal stratification groups (high vs low). Correlation analysis between DMGs and clinicopathological features revealed that BRAF/NRAS expression levels were associated with THCA clinical stage. CIBERSORT computational algorithm was also used to quantify the relative abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs), demonstrating that 11 types of activated TICs were strongly associated with BRAF expression. Finally, we examined target DMGs expression in relation to immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) to identify potential therapeutic targets. THCA specimens with suppressed BRAF expression demonstrated upregulated ICPs expression, indicating potential susceptibility to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bourdillon AT, Yao A, Bur AM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5462'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5462&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678150/'&gt;41678150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Radiomics is a field that establishes associations between quantifiable imaging biomarkers and histopathological characteristics or clinical outcomes. Radiomics holds particular promise in otolaryngology given anatomic intricacies, diverse pathologies, and many commonplace imaging modalities. Radiomics applications span diagnostic classifiers, long-term prognosticators, and predictors of treatment response. The objective of this Review was to establish methodological frameworks, identify common limitations, and evaluate the current landscape of radiomics within otolaryngology. OBSERVATIONS: Radiomics applications span the breadth of otolaryngology, with most focused on neoplasms of the upper airway, larynx, sinonasal passages, and skull base. Head and neck cancer applications include classifiers of clinically occult pathologic features (such as extranodal extension or nodal metastases) that can guide treatment options. Prognostic radiomics can reliably model recurrence and survival outcomes, with hybrid clinical radiomics models achieving superior performance compared with single-modality models. Treatment prediction through approaches like dosiomics (using radiotherapy dose distributions) and δ-radiomics (sequential imaging over time) have shown potential in improving the prediction of therapeutic response, tumor recurrence, and radiotherapy toxic effects. Beyond neoplastic classifiers, a growing body of work has sought to risk stratify or predict the evolution of rhinologic and otologic inflammatory conditions (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis, middle ear disease). Recently, there have also been radiomics applications in sleep and pediatrics. Despite these broad advances, radiomics models have several pitfalls, such as variable imaging protocols, resource-intensive manual segmentation, limited cohort sizes, and a lack of external validation, all of which hinder clinical translation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this Review suggest that radiomics is a promising tool that can be integrated with clinical and pathologic data to enhance diagnosis, optimize prognostication, and personalize treatment in otolaryngology. Standardization of imaging protocols, rigorous validation in multi-institutional cohorts, and integration with clinical workflows remain critical prerequisites for clinical application. With continued refinement and integration, radiomics applications may help streamline clinical workflows and guide treatment planning.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang SH, Cotler J, Palis B, Seethala RR, Hosni A, O'Sullivan B, Vander Poorten V, Bishop JA, Glastonbury CM, Beadle B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5396'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5396&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678147/'&gt;41678147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: A unified salivary gland carcinoma (SGC)-specific tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification can enhance prognostic accuracy, support clinical decision-making, and improve the quality of patient care. OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an SGC-specific pTNM classification with improved prognostic accuracy and optimized stage distribution for version nine of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging protocol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

Current guidelines recommend TSH ≥30 mIU/L, a target that prolongs hypothyroidism and worsens quality of life, yet rests on limited evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between pre-RAI TSH levels and oncologic outcomes in adults with DTC prepared by THW. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes across pre-RAI TSH thresholds (&lt;30 vs. ≥30, &lt;60 vs. ≥60, and &lt;90 vs. ≥90 mIU/L) in adults with DTC prepared by THW. Primary outcomes included disease-specific mortality, recurrence, and response to therapy. Searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus (inception to March 2025) identified eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the CLARITY tool and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020158354). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight retrospective cohort studies comprising a total of 4651 DTC patients, predominantly women (68.5%) with a mean age of 46 years. All patients underwent THW before RAI. Across all TSH thresholds examined (&lt;30, &lt;60, and &lt;90 mIU/L), higher pre-RAI TSH levels were not associated with better treatment response, lower recurrence, or reduced mortality. Specifically, patients with higher pre-RAI TSH levels (≥30 mIU/L) did not have better oncologic outcomes compared with those with lower levels (&lt;30 mIU/L). At 2- and 3-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed in excellent (pooled RR = 0.87; confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.11) or indeterminate (RR = 1.28; CI 0.72-2.27) response rates. Similarly, recurrence rates did not differ (RR = 1.45; CI 0.83-2.55), and no study demonstrated a difference in disease-specific mortality across follow-up periods extending up to 10 years. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was rated very low due to risk of bias, heterogeneity, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base is insufficient to support or refute the routine use of a specific TSH threshold before RAI administration. These findings question the recommendation to achieve TSH ≥30 mIU/L before RAI and highlight the need for trials to define the minimal effective level of TSH stimulation.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 28 institutions contributed data on 3061 patients. From this, there were 64 pediatric patients (2.1%). Clinical variables, overall and disease-free survival (OS and DFS) outcomes, and multivariable factors associated with outcome were evaluated. RESULTS: The male-to-female ratio was 37:27 and the median [IQR] age at diagnosis was 14.0 [9.6-16.0] years. The most common malignancy was sarcoma (57.8%), followed by esthesioneuroblastoma (25.0%) and carcinoma (17.2%). Negative margins were achieved in 53.1% children. Dural invasion was associated with reduced OS and DFS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with improved survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Open approaches were widely used for pediatric skull base tumor resection in the period between 1995 and 2015 but we saw a rise in the use of endoscopic and combined techniques by the end of the period covered by this study. Our results may represent a transitional era in which alternative endoscopic techniques continue to expand.</description>

More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI -6.7-9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1-2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1-2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1-2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</description>

DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Seven hospitals in China between 18 August 2020 and 21 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-70 years with newly diagnosed high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after three cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (stage 4a, stage 2-3 with stable or progressive disease, or detectable Epstein-Barr virus DNA). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive combination chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin (standard treatment group) or standard treatment with 19 cycles of intravenous camrelizumab (200 mg) once every three weeks (radiotherapy plus two concurrent cycles and 17 adjuvant cycles; camrelizumab group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat group was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: 390 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=194) or the standard treatment group (n=196). At median follow-up of 39.9 months (interquartile range 36.8-43.4 months), progression-free survival was higher in the camrelizumab group than the standard treatment group (36 months: 83.4%, 95% confidence interval 78.3% to 88.8% v 71.3%, 65.2% to 77.9%; stratified hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77, P=0.001). The incidence of acute and late adverse events (grade 3 or 4) was 50.5% and 3.2% in the camrelizumab group compared with 48.7% and 3.7% in the standard treatment group. Immunological adverse events (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 19 patients (10.2%) in the camrelizumab group. CONCLUSION: The addition of camrelizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment improved progression-free survival among patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after induction chemotherapy.

In countries with universal healthcare such as Spain, the impact of rurality on head and neck cancer remains poorly characterized. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 1042 patients discussed at the Head and Neck Tumor Board of a tertiary hospital in Málaga, Spain (2019-2023). Demographic, clinical, and behavioral variables were collected. Rurality was defined according to Spanish legislation (population &lt; 30,000 and density &lt; 100 inhabitants/km2). Analyses included chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Rural patients had a higher prevalence of tobacco use (74.8% vs. 66.3%, p = 0.0074) and more severe smoking patterns, especially among men. Advanced-stage tumors were slightly more frequent in rural patients (64.5% vs. 60.6%) without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.6097). No associations were found between rurality and alcohol use, HPV status, or tumor site, while EBV positivity was more frequent in urban patients (p = 0.0235). CONCLUSIONS: Rural residence was associated with significantly higher tobacco use but not with advanced disease stage at diagnosis. These findings highlight rurality as a social determinant of health and support the need for targeted public health strategies to reduce cancer-related disparities in rural populations.</description>

METHODS: In this retrospective study, race/ethnicity-stratified inferential and mediation analyses assessed selected clinical outcomes for 70 581 OPSCC patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. We examined the effects of Food Environment Atlas scores composited from 282-county-level variables, adjusted for the effects of traditional social determinants of health. RESULTS: Worse food environments were modestly associated with increased risk of overall mortality (aHR-1.03, 95% CI, 1.02-1.04), 3-year overall mortality (aOR-1.04, 95% CI, 1.03-1.05), and advanced stage at diagnosis (aOR-1.02, 95% CI, 1.01-1.03) in the whole sample, with exacerbated associations across all outcomes among non-White patients. The food environment was not significantly associated with having more than one primary tumor at diagnosis. Traditional social determinants of health partially mediated mortality, but not staging effects. CONCLUSIONS: Poor food environments were modestly associated with increased OPSCC mortality and advanced staging, with exacerbated effects in non-White patients. These retrospective findings support investigations into specific mechanisms of food environment inequity on OPSCC outcomes to guide targeted public health interventions such as subsidized transportation.</description>

This trend has raised concerns regarding overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC) plays a pivotal role in preoperative risk stratification, yet clinical decision-making remains challenging in indeterminate categories (Bethesda III-V), particularly in resource-limited settings where molecular testing is unavailable. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk of malignancy (ROM) for each TBSRTC category among patients who underwent thyroid surgery over a 10-year period at a tertiary care center in India, and to compare these rates with the 2023 TBSRTC risk estimates. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed fine-needle aspiration cytology and histopathology data for all patients who underwent thyroid surgeries conducted between 2014 and 2024. ROM across TBSRTC categories was calculated and compared with established TBSRTC risk estimates. RESULTS: A 100% malignancy rate was observed in TBSRTC VI category, supporting the reliability of surgical decisions in this group. However, significantly higher malignancy rates were found in TBSRTC categories III (58.7%), IV (82.7%), and V (100%) compared to TBSRTC estimates (22%, 30%, and 74%, respectively). TBSRTC III nuclear had a significantly higher malignancy rate (70.0%) than TBSRTC III other (40.57%). CONCLUSION: Institution specific malignancy data enhances the clinical utility of TBSRTC and improves patient counseling, particularly in settings where molecular diagnostics are not feasible.</description>

We previously reported the discovery of a tumor DNA methylation signature of hypoxia (Hypoxia-M), identifying HNSCC patients at risk for local recurrence (LR), all event progression, and death after primary radiochemotherapy (RCHT). We further validate Hypoxia-M in an independent cohort of HNSCC patients who underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) METHODS: Hypoxia-M was validated in HPV-negative HNSCC patients (n = 134) homogeneously treated with PORT-C in the frame of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) multicenter biomarker trial. DNA methylation was profiled using Illumina450K technology. The performance of Hypoxia-M was integrated with previously reported biomarkers, including gene expression signatures (GES) of hypoxia, a methylome-based HPV-Independent Classifier of disease Recurrence (HICR), and immune cell score using immunohistochemistry (CD3/CD8/PD-L1/PD1). RESULTS: Hypoxia-M was independently prognostic for overall survival (OS, HR = 2.34, p = 0.03) and distant metastasis (DM, HR = 4.3, p = 0.001), but not for LR after PORT-C. Hypoxia-M remained significant after adjusting for patientś age, gender, smoking status, tumor stage, and high-risk features (ECE&amp;/R1 resection). Hypoxia-M status was inversely associated with CD8 T-cell infiltration. Patient stratification improved by integrating previously reported biomarkers, with Hypoxia-M demonstrating independent prognostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of Hypoxia-M was validated in an independent cohort. Our results highlighted a difference in recurrence patterns of hypoxic tumors treated in the primary setting (local recurrence) versus postoperatively (distant metastasis) and the utility of Hypoxia-M for identifying the main pattern of recurrence.</description>

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the antitumor immune response and type I interferon response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear and require further elucidation. In this study, we identify CD38 in NPC cells as a key mediator impairing T cell antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, CD38 induces mitochondrial autophagy through PHB2, enhances the interaction between PHB2 and MAVS, leading to the degradation of MAVS protein, and inhibits the type I interferon response and CD8+T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Importantly, CD38 promotes tumor progression and reduces the proportion of CD8+T cells and IFNγ+CD8+T cells in vivo via MAVS. In conclusion, these findings reveal previously unrecognized roles and mechanisms of CD38 in regulating anti-tumor T cell immunity, suggesting that inhibition of CD38 could initiate tumor-targeted immune responses, enhance anti-tumor immunity in patients, and provide new therapeutic strategies for NPC.</description>

Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monotherapy showed lower response in OMM than other subtypes of melanoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab with anlotinib in patients with advanced OMM between August 2018 and September 2024. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR); the secondary endpoints included disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). RESULTS: Forty-one patients were enrolled in our study. Seventeen patients (41.4%) achieved an objective response. The median PFS was 6.4 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-8.3 months), and the median OS was 10.0 months (95% CI, 8.3-11.7 months). Thirty-three patients (80.5%) experienced at least one TRAE. The most common TRAEs were hypertension (29.3%), hand-foot syndrome (19.5%), and anemia (19.5%). Grade 3 or higher TRAEs occurred in two patients (4.8%), and no grade 5 TRAEs were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggested that pembrolizumab with anlotinib in patients with advanced OMM showed potential efficacy and manageable adverse effects. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of this combination strategy.</description>

Recent studies have suggested that this difference persists even after accounting for smoking and alcohol use, highlighting the need to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that sex differences in HNSCC are androgen-dependent and identified androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and function. Mechanically, early growth response 4 (EGR4) functioned as a direct downstream transcriptional effector of AR that induced CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction. Clinically, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was an effective therapeutic strategy in HNSCC, suppressing tumor growth in mice while improving intratumoral CD8⁺ T cell function. Moreover, combining ADT with immune checkpoint inhibitors led to improved antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal ADT as a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the antitumor activity of sex-biased CD8⁺ T cells in HNSCC, which could inform the development of sex-biased immunotherapies for treating HNSCC patients.</description>

We evaluated the added value of fluorescently labeled tilmanocept in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of the oral cavity compared to gamma probe. METHODS: Healthy male New Zealand white rabbits received oral cavity injections of radioactive (Technetium 99m) and fluorescently (IRDye800) conjugated tilmanocept followed by either fluorescence guided (n = 14) or gamma probe guided (n = 14) SLNB performed 1 h, 48 h, or 5 days postinjection. Duration of the SLNB performed by two individuals was measured and compared using the two methods. RESULTS: Fluorescence guidance resulted in a 1.8-fold reduction in time of SLN removal (median 104 vs. 191 s, p = 0.05). For the fluorescence guided SLNB, 7.1% (1 of 14) had nonsentinel node tissue removed prior to the correct identification of the SLN, whereas gamma probe/radioactivity guided SLNB had 28.6% (4 of 14). When comparing operation time between attending and resident surgeon, time to identification of first SLN was not significantly different for fluorescence guided surgery (82 vs. 107 s, respectively) or with gamma probe (158 vs. 204 s); however, median times using the gamma probe were nearly double for both operators. We additionally show the durability of fluorescence signal up to 5 days and clear visualization of proposed tracer with commercially available intraoperative imagers. CONCLUSION: The use of fluorescent labeled tilmanocept decreases operative time needed for SLNB as well as reduces the amount of nonsentinel tissue removed. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

We aim to explore the effect of tobacco cessation on the risk of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC). A case-control study was conducted across five cancer centres in India. We enrolled 2320 BMC and 2302 frequency-matched controls. Information was collected on smoking and chewing (products, duration and quitting). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of tobacco cessation compared to current users, after adjusting for potential confounders. For both smoking and chewing, the odds reduced rapidly after 5 years of quitting, so that those who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago had only 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.54) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to smoke, and those who quit chewing ≥10 years ago had 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to chew. Chewing with areca nut was associated with almost double the risk of chewing without (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.53-2.26) but the rate of reduction of risk with quitting was similar. These findings show clearly the benefits of quitting and inform policies that emphasize chewing tobacco cessation, given its widespread prevalence in India.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Singh SP, Prasad S, Dean PM, Kujur AL, Jaiswal G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107862&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41655423/'&gt;41655423&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Extranodal extension (ENE) of cervical lymph node metastases is a key prognostic factor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the survival impact of ENE in HNSCC and identified global research trends relevant to this research field through a complementary bibliometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus were systematically searched during 2000-2025. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Biblioshiny package of R to identify and map the publication trends, influential authors, and major institutional contributions between 2010 and 2025. RESULTS: Of the 839 retrieved records, 711 studies were screened, and 16 studies comprising approximately 3900 patients met all inclusion criteria. The bibliometric analysis of 120 Scopus-indexed publications demonstrated a marked increase in ENE-related research from 2015 onward, driven primarily by institutions in Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea. Keyword mapping indicated expanding intersections of ENE research with radiomics, prognostic modelling, and refinement of staging systems. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant association between ENE and adverse survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed consistently poor prognostic implications across both pathologic and radiologic ENE assessments. CONCLUSION: ENE in cervical lymph node metastases is an independent and strong predictor of adverse survival in HNSCC. The increasing global attention to ENE highlights its crucial role in multidisciplinary oncologic management. Therefore, standardized pathological and imaging-based assessment of ENE is essential for developing superior prognostic models and optimizing future treatment planning strategies.</description>

METHODS: All patients with T2N0 glottic cancer treated with partial laryngeal IMRT in 2009-2021 in our institution were retrospectively reviewed. For comparison, cohorts with T1N0 and T3N0 disease were also included. Locoregional failure (LRF), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared among T1N0, T2N0 with normal VCM (T2-Normal-VCM), T2N0 with impaired VCM (T2-Impaired-VCM), and T3N0 groups. Multivariable analysis (MVA) assessed the prognostic value of VCM within the T2N0 group. RESULTS: A total of 642 cases were included: 288 T1N0, 224 T2N0 (147 T2-Normal-VCM, 77 T2-Impaired-VCM), and 130 T3N0. Median follow-up was 5.0 years (IQR 3.4-6.2). Five-year LRF for T1N0, T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 were 4% (95% CI 2-6), 9% (5-15), 27% (17-38), and 35% (27-44), respectively. Corresponding DFS was 83% (78-88), 80% (73-87), 55% (45-68), and 50% (41-60), while OS was 85% (80-90), 86% (80-92), 71% (61-83), and 59% (50-69), respectively. In T2N0, MVA confirmed that impaired VCM was associated with higher LRF (aHR 3.72 [95% CI 1.79-7.71], p &lt; 0.001), lower DFS (aHR 2.74 [1.68-4.45], p &lt; 0.001), and lower OS (aHR 2.07 [1.17-3.67], p = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: In this contemporary cohort, LRF rates increased stepwise from T1N0 to T2-Normal-VCM, T2-Impaired-VCM, and T3N0 glottic cancer. Within T2N0 disease, impaired VCM is an adverse prognostic factor, supporting subdivision into T2a (normal VCM) and T2b (impaired VCM) in future TNM revisions. Prospective studies are warranted to assess whether treatment intensification can improve outcomes for T2-Impaired-VCM disease.</description>

WDTC is biologically heterogeneous, with generally favorable prognosis but substantial variability in clinical behavior. Advances in molecular imaging, artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostics, and liquid biopsy have altered diagnostic strategies, while targeted therapy and immunotherapy have expanded treatment options for selected patients with advanced disease. The multidisciplinary team (MDT) model has therefore become an essential component of WDTC management through the integration of expertise from multiple specialties. METHODS: This review examines the role of MDT application in WDTC through analysis of relevant literature and international clinical guidelines, focusing on MDT composition, implementation models, clinical roles across diagnostic and therapeutic pathways, and current limitations. Differences in MDT recommendations among guidelines from various regions were also compared. RESULTS: MDT involvement supports personalized decision-making in WDTC, particularly in cases with indeterminate diagnosis, risk-adapted treatment selection, recurrent disease, and radioiodine-refractory progression. Persistent challenges include overtreatment of low-risk disease, suboptimal management of high-risk cases, limited MDT implementation in primary hospitals, uneven specialty participation, and variability in decision-making within guideline gray zones. CONCLUSION: The MDT model provides a structured framework to improve risk-adapted management of WDTC. Future efforts should prioritize refined risk-stratified MDT models, integration of decision-support tools, and expansion of remote platforms to enhance consistency and quality of management.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 202 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer who completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical data such as age, sex, educational status, employment, tumor size, ATA risk classification, TNM stage, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy were recorded. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, Spearman correlation, and multivariable linear regression to determine predictors of global HRQoL score. RESULTS: The median global HRQoL was 58.3 (IQR: 50.0-75.0). Functional scores were highest in role, emotional, cognitive, and social domains (median 66.7). Fatigue was the most prominent symptom (median: 44.4), followed by pain, dyspnea, and insomnia (each 33.3). Female sex, lower educational level, and higher RAI dose were associated with lower global HRQoL scores. Emotional functioning was significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 55 years. Multivariable regression analysis identified sex, education level, RAI dose, and TNM stage as significant predictors of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Despite generally favorable prognoses in DTC, multiple demographic and treatment-related variables significantly influence patient-reported HRQoL. RAI therapy and disease stage may impact HRQoL less than previously assumed. These findings highlight the importance of individualized supportive care strategies in survivorship plans.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study involved 1,088 patients who underwent oncologic head and neck surgery from August 2012 to November 2024. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: The main outcome measure was 60-day Emergency Department (ED) visit or readmission after primary hospital discharge following surgery. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by state-level area deprivation index (ADI). RESULTS: Predictors of re-presentation within 60 days of discharge on univariate analysis include tumor stage 4 (OR: 1.52, 95% Cl: 1.01-2.31, P = .044), longer primary length of stay (OR: 1.03, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.05, P &lt; .001), and residency in the 4th quartile state ADI (OR: 1.54, 95% Cl: 1.03-2.31, P = .037). Multivariable logistic regression identified laryngeal cancer (OR: 1.60, 95% Cl: 1.16-2.21, 0.004) and discharge with home health or other care facilities (2.22, 95% Cl: 1.67-2.96, P &lt; .001) as predictive factors. Patients from low ADI neighborhoods (Q1-3) were more likely to be discharged home, whereas those from high ADI neighborhoods (Q4) where almost twice as likely to be discharged with home health or to care facilities than home alone (18.70% vs 10.29%, P = &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that clinical and systemic factors contribute to re-presentation to the hospital after major oncologic head and neck surgery. Addressing these factors through targeted policies and institutional initiatives may help mitigate the morbidity and cost associated with representation.</description>

The purpose of this study is to perform the first meta-analysis examining intraoperative margin assessment methods in OCSCC with the goal of determining if there is a significant difference in patient outcomes between specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Studies met inclusion criteria if they conducted intraoperative specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis in patients with OCSCC and reported patient outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze the compiled data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 1988 articles for initial review of which 9 (1240 participants) met criteria for inclusion and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that a specimen-based approach is associated with higher intraoperative re-resection rate (P &lt; .05), significantly lower final positive margin rate (P &lt; .05), and decreased local recurrence when compared to the tumor bed-based approach (P &lt; .05). However, there was no significant difference in overall recurrence when comparing intraoperative margin analysis methods (P &gt; .05). Additionally, none of the included studies noted a significant difference in survival outcomes between tumor bed versus specimen-based methods. CONCLUSION: Specimen-based frozen margin analysis in OCSCC results in lower false negative rates and improved local control; however, there is no significant difference in overall recurrence or survival when comparing specimen-based vs tumor bed-based techniques.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study of 86 patients with sinonasal masses treated at the University of Arizona between January 2010 and December 2024. SETTING: Single tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: Patients were stratified into urban (n = 41), suburban (n = 12), or rural (n = 33) locations based on home location population size. We analyzed patient demographics and clinical data to determine the influence of geographic location on diagnostic delays, treatment, and survival. Statistical significance was defined as P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The mean age at presentation was 62.3 years across all locations. Diabetes was more common in rural locations (36.4%) (P = .006). Patients from rural locations exhibited the highest tobacco exposure (21.2% current smokers, 33.3% former smokers) (P = .044). Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common subtype (33.7%). The longest interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was in rural locations (342.7 days) (P = .29). Geographic location was the strongest predictor of diagnostic delays, with urban locations independently associated with a 205-day shorter time to diagnosis than rural locations (P = .021). Patients from urban locations received the most radiation therapy (82.9%) (P = .047). Race and geographic location significantly influenced the risk of death (Likelihood ratio χ²(6) = 24.21, P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: This study identifies significant geographic disparities in diabetes, smoking, diagnostic delays, treatment, and racial and ethnic risk of death. Prospective studies are required to investigate these factors further and improve equitable access to comprehensive care for patients with sinonasal masses.</description>

Current therapies for metastatic MTC comprise various tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, but resistance often appears due to the need for lifelong treatments. Like in other tumors, genetic, epigenetic, post-transcriptional, post-translational, and cell-cell interaction events influence drug response. However, progress in understanding MTC biology is limited by the lack of reliable in vivo and in vitro models. This study aims to develop a patient-derived model faithfully reproducing the microenvironmental alterations present in MTC. METHODS: We applied a two-step protocol consisting of a first phase in which primary cells are cultivated as multicellular spheroids and a second phase in which they are switched to adherent cultures. After evaluation of the genetic background by targeted Next Generation Sequencing, we characterized our cells phenotype by examining a panel of stem/progenitor-related markers, the secretory abilities by ELISAs, the drug response by proliferation assays, the in vivo angiogenic and invasiveness by the use of zebrafish model, the in vitro invasivity by Matrigel Dome assays and the spatial variation of stem/progenitor marker in both 3D cell models and tissue samples by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Our model allowed the establishment of eight MTC patient-derived cell lines with different genetic backgrounds. The cultures faithfully reproduced the changes in stem and progenitor markers that we detected in our cohort of MTC tissue samples and could be successfully xenotransplanted in zebrafish model, showing both angiogenetic and invasive properties. Drug screening assays revealed the potential of our model for the study of patient-specific responses, as we were able to identify different candidate regulators of the sensitivity to currently available therapies for MTC. CONCLUSIONS: Our two-step protocol successfully generated primary MTC lines that maintain high plasticity, can be cultivated for several passages, and recreate the heterogeneity observed in patients' tissues. Our model will offer a robust platform for preclinical drug testing and mechanistic studies, addressing a longstanding gap in MTC research. It enables exploration of tumor microenvironment interactions and personalized therapeutic responses, supporting progress beyond current genomic-driven frameworks.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based regimens, received paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 every 21 days plus weekly cetuximab (C) 250 mg/m2 for up to six cycles, followed by C maintenance. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best overall response (BoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age 64 years). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had a primary tumor in the oropharynx, 17 (29.8%) in the oral cavity, 9 (15.8%) in the hypopharynx, and 6 (10.5%) in the larynx. The ORR was 43.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7% to 57.6%], the BoR was 47.4% (95% CI 34.0% to 61.0%) with nine (15.8%) complete responses, and the DCR was 71.9% (95% CI 58.5% to 83.0%). DoR was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.1 months-not reached). Median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI 5.5-8.4 months) and 12.2 months (95% CI 10.5-17.6 months), respectively. Six-month PFS and OS rates were 49.0% and 73.0%, respectively. The most frequent non-hematological treatment-related adverse events were C-associated skin rash (78.9%) and PTX-related polyneuropathy (35.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective trial specifically evaluating PTX plus C after failure of first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with R/M SCCHN. The observed clinical activity and tolerability support this widely available regimen as a potential standard-of-care option in the absence of randomized evidence in this setting.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study included 3578 NPC patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Ninety-four RTLI patients were recruited based on inclusion criteria and matched 1:1 with 97 control subjects using propensity scores. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 135) and the validation cohort (n = 59). Deep transfer learning (DTL) features and dosiomics features were extracted from ADC map and three-dimensional dose distribution, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were employed to identify predictive features. Subsequently, eight machine learning classification models were trained to establish a prediction framework, encompassing Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. The performance of clinical, DTL, dosiomics and feature fusion model was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We constructed six pre-trained transfer learning networks and extracted DTL features, respectively. The results showed that pre-trained WideResNet 101 exhibited superior performance with an AUC of 0.786 in the validation cohort. The clinical model based on D1cc and induction chemotherapy demonstrated an AUC of 0.794 and the dosiomics model demonstrated an AUC of 0.903. Features fusion model demonstrated the highest AUC values in both the training (0.988) and validation (0.940) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion model based on pretreatment ADC map and dose distribution provided a promising way to predict RTLI in NPC patients receiving IMRT, which can support clinicians in making decisions to develop individualized treatment plans and implement preventive measures.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Dragan T, Chiairi I, Salmon M, Lalami Y, Digonnet A, Lipski S, Van Gestel D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2026.1724193'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2026.1724193&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41675289/'&gt;41675289&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is rare in non-endemic regions but poses unique clinical challenges, especially among ethnically diverse populations. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics, treatment outcomes, and toxicity profiles of NPC patients treated with definitive intensity-modulated radio-chemotherapy (IMRT-CRT) in a non-endemic European center. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 82 consecutive patients with histologically confirmed NPC treated at Institut Jules Bordet between 2012 and 2024. Patient, tumor, treatment characteristics, survival outcomes, and treatment-related toxicity were evaluated. Survival endpoints were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 35 months. Most patients were male (77%), of North African descent (66%), and had non-keratinizing carcinoma (96%). Advanced disease (stage III/IV) was present in 72%, and 78% of tested tumors were EBV-positive. Induction chemotherapy (ICT) and concurrent chemotherapy (CCT) were administered in 32% of patients. At 5 years, actuarial estimates for overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional disease-free survival (LRDFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and distant disease-free survival (DFS) were 73%, 79%, 86%, 87%, and 87%, respectively. Higher T stage, treatment-related weight loss, positive nodal findings on 3-month FDG-PET-CT, and disease recurrence were associated with worse OS. Acute and late toxicities were generally manageable; however, xerostomia, hypothyroidism, ototoxicity, and weight loss were prevalent. CONCLUSIONS: Despite being conducted in a non-endemic region, this study revealed NPC characteristics and outcomes resembling those in endemic populations, likely due to patient demographics. Early metabolic response and nutritional status emerged as critical prognostic factors, highlighting the need for individualized treatment and supportive care strategies in NPC management.</description>

However, the effect of timely initiation of PORT among the subset of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OCSCC) patients has not been reported. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine if starting PORT within 6 weeks of surgery versus 6 to 12 weeks was associated with improved survival among OCSCC patients. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study reviewed data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004 to 2019. OCSCC patients treated with curative intent surgery followed by PORT were identified. Exclusion criteria included history of prior radiation, receiving PORT &gt;12 weeks after surgery, multiple primary malignancies, or unknown survival time. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was time to initiation of PORT, either within 6 weeks or at 6 to 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The primary outcome was overall survival (OS) defined as date of diagnosis until date of death or last follow-up. COVARIATES: Demographic data, cancer-related variables, and treatment characteristics were collected. ANALYSES: Univariate survival analyses were performed using the log rank test. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis for overall mortality was performed using a set of demographically, clinically, and biologically pertinent predictors. Statistical significance was set at a P value of &lt; .05. RESULTS: A total of 32,743 subjects were included. The mean age was 59.9 (18 to 90) years. Overall, 66.2% (n = 21,691) were male. The median follow-up was 42.6 months (IQR 19.4 to 79.5). Average overall survival was 55.3 months. In the univariate survival analysis, PORT timing was associated with OS when divided into 2 week (P &lt; .001) and 6 week (P &lt; .001) intervals. After accounting for covariates, starting PORT within 6 weeks was associated with improved OS compared to 6 to 12 weeks (HR 1.08; 95% CI 1.01 to 1.16; P = .037). The duration of radiation therapy did not influence OS (HR 1.00; 95% CI 1.0 to 1.0; P = .4). CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with the NCCN guidelines, the findings suggest that initiating PORT within 6 weeks is associated with improved survival among OCSCC patients undergoing curative intent surgery.</description>

This report's purpose is to describe the histologic and demographic features of intraosseous mucoepidermoid carcinoma (IMEC) and to add evidence to support a potential relationship with glandular odontogenic cysts (GOCs). STUDY DESIGN: Cases of patients diagnosed with IMEC were obtained from Oral Pathology Laboratory, Inc, at New York-Presbyterian Queens from 1985 to 2024. Slides and clinical information were reviewed. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with IMEC were identified who had an average age of 58.6 years and a slight female predilection. IMEC was equally present in both jaws. Twelve patients were classified as having low-grade tumors with cystic areas composed of an admixture of epidermoid and mucous cells, 6 cases of which had areas resembling GOCs. Two patients had high-grade tumors demonstrating anaplasia and perineural invasion. One high-grade tumor had areas that resembled a GOC. Four of the 7 presentations of IMEC (6 low-grade and 1 high-grade) with GOC features were from the mandible. CONCLUSIONS: We describe the common and uncommon histopathologic features of IMEC while also demonstrating that GOC-type areas often are seen as a component of these tumors. Therefore, all lesions identified as GOCs should be carefully analyzed to rule out the early development of an IMEC.</description>

The role of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in improving oncologic outcomes remains controversial. This study aimed to assess the potential benefits of CRT compared with exclusive radiotherapy (RT) in ACC patients treated with curative intent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using real-world data from a tertiary cancer center. Patients with head and neck ACC treated with curative RT between 2007 and 2022 were analyzed. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to control for confounding factors. The primary survival outcomes were distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and distant metastasis-free interval (DMFI). RESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included (89% receiving surgery), of whom 24 received CRT. Median follow-up was 85.2 months. In the unmatched cohort, CRT showed a trend toward improved DMFS (median 101.38 months versus 50.16 months, P = 0.052) and DMFI (101.38 months versus 53.25 months, P = 0.071). PSM analysis (n = 40) demonstrated statistically significant improvement in DMFI for CRT (median 101.38 months versus 39.8 months, P = 0.032; hazard ratio for distant metastasis 0.43, P = 0.037). No significant differences were observed in overall survival or locoregional control. CONCLUSIONS: CRT may delay the onset of distant metastasis and extend DMFI in ACC patients, particularly younger and fit individuals. While overall survival benefits were not observed, these findings support CRT consideration in selected patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these results.</description>

Retrospective and prospective collection of high-quality data for research use while respecting data protection and patient privacy remains a challenge in the clinical environment. Currently, months of laborious extraction and clinical annotation are often necessary before data analysis can begin. We present a novel institutional federated data lake, utilising open-source software, to facilitate efficient production of ML models from head and neck cancer (HNC) imaging and radiotherapy (RT) data. This structured pipeline dramatically reduces the time associated with the production of ML models and real-world evidence generation. This paper describes our governance-compliant processes and provides a framework for establishing similar databases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extensible NeuroImaging Archival Toolkit (XNAT) is a powerful open-source imaging platform. Within our department, it forms a part of the local secure enclave for the purposes of federated learning in artificial intelligence projects and provides import, archiving, processing, search and secure distribution facilities for imaging and RT data. RESULTS: We have created a clinically annotated, carefully curated, data lake of 2895 consenting HNC patients containing 22 170 relevant diagnostic, staging, treatment and monitoring imaging sets. Key recommendations for replication include infrastructure planning, robust patient and data selection criteria and prioritising patient consent and privacy. CONCLUSIONS: This secure and extensible imaging and HNC RT cancer database setup promises to be an exceedingly useful tool for research, revolutionising the time and cost associated with the production of ML models, making the process safer, faster and more efficient.</description>

These rare HNCs can be rare because of their histology or anatomical location. The federation of clinical data warehouses (CDWs) holds potential for advancing our understanding of these pathologies. This study aimed to develop a multimodal algorithm to identify rare HNC patients in a CDW. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study on the CDW of a conglomerate of 38 university hospitals. We developed a multimodal classification algorithm to identify rare HNC patients by integrating International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10) codes, Association for the Development of Computer Science in Cytology and Pathological Anatomy (ADICAP) codes and free-text data from pathology reports using natural language processing (NLP). Algorithm performance was evaluated by an HNC medical expert using a validation set of 100 manually annotated cases. RESULTS: Of 333 852 cancer patients, 9141 were identified as HNC patients based on ICD-10 and ADICAP codes. The multimodal algorithm using ICD-10 or ADICAP codes or NLP-processed free text classified 4515 patients as rare HNC patients, with 2168 identified by a minimum of two data sources. It showed a 91% sensitivity and a 95% specificity when relying on multiple data sources, with a 76% positive predictive value observed for rare histology identification compared with 43% for rare topography. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility and utility of a multimodal electronic health record-based approach to identify rare HNC patients in a CDW. Incorporating free-text and structured data improves the reliability of such cohort identification.</description>

Furthermore, HNS are understudied in Asians, and prospective clinical trials are untenable. To better understand HNS and improve treatment, real-world studies in Asians with accurate histological typing are thus needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with histologically confirmed sarcoma diagnosis in the head and neck region between 1985 and 2023 was carried out at the National Cancer Centre Singapore. Multivariate Cox regression was used to analyse risk factors for overall survival (OS), and parametric time-to-event modelling was used to develop a prognostic calculator. RESULTS: A total of 275 patients were analysed. The 5-year OS was 43.2% (95% confidence interval 36.2% to 51.6%). Among demographic risk factors, a high incidence of radiotherapy-associated sarcomas in the population at 11.3% placed the population at higher risk for aggressive disease (decreased treatment response and poorer prognosis). With interventions, microscopically negative (R0) surgical resection margins were significantly associated with improved OS. Parametric time-to-event simulations suggested microscopically positive (R1) resections to also be beneficial for OS in locally advanced tumours and nonaggressive sarcoma histology, and improved greatly alongside high-dose radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: We present the largest Asian HNS cohort, with diverse subtypes and disease extent. Our analysis highlights poor outcomes from a higher incidence of radiotherapy-associated disease, showing the challenging landscape of HNS in Asia. Through our prognostic calculator, we demonstrate how meaningfully curated real-world data in a rare disease entity can be used for the prediction of OS in individual patients with specific treatment approaches.</description>

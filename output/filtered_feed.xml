PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li H, Ding Y, Wu Y, Fang Y, Li X, Shi W, Chen S, Yang A, Zhang J, Shi R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70145'&gt;10.1002/hed.70145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424359/'&gt;41424359&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The gingiva and floor of the mouth are distinct subsites, and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) originating in these locations warrants further indepth understanding. METHODS: This study enrolled patients with OSCC from 2000 to 2020, and analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics. Kaplan-Meier analysis compared overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Univariate analysis and multivariate Cox proportional hazards model examined the risk factors on survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 885 OSCC patients were included, with the most common tumor subsites: oral tongue (41.9%), gingiva (31.8%), and floor of mouth (16.0%). Gingival and floor of mouth showed a higher proportion of advanced stage (65.8%, 66.9%) and significantly poorer OS (3-year: 63.0%, 57.0%; 5-year: 49.8%, 37.3%) and RFS (3-year: 59.1%, 61.3%; 5-year: 55.5%, 57.0%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly reduced mortality in gingival cancer (HR = 0.598), while tobacco exposure (HR = 1.952) was associated with a significant increase in mortality in floor of mouth cancer. CONCLUSION: Gingival cancer and floor of mouth cancer have a worse prognosis, and thus require greater attention throughout the entire management process.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tawk K, Dichter A, Park T, Abouzari M, Oliaei S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70333'&gt;10.1002/lary.70333&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424261/'&gt;41424261&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential risk factors associated with the development of sialolithiasis in a database-driven case-control study. METHODS: The All of Us database was queried for participants with sialolithiasis. These participants were matched to controls by age, race, and gender. Demographics and medical history data, such as obesity, hypertension, tonsillitis, gout, and other conditions associated with salivary stones, were extracted and compared among participants. A logistic regression model using optimized parameters was used to identify variables associated with sialolithiasis. RESULTS: In total, 2160 participants were included in the analysis, with 540 diagnosed with sialolithiasis and 1620 matched controls. Sjogren's syndrome (OR = 2.057, 95% CI: 1.106-3.824, p = 0.023) and obesity (OR = 1.419, 95% CI: 1.118-1.802, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with increased odds of sialolithiasis, while essential hypertension (OR = 0.279, 95% CI: 0.23-0.339, p = 0.0) and Type 2 diabetes without complication (OR = 0.771, 95% CI: 0.601-0.989, p = 0.041) were inversely associated. No significant associations were observed for dehydration, hyperparathyroidism, acute tonsillitis, alcohol abuse, smoking, hypercalcemia, gout, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis, or bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using a large-scale database, aimed to identify potential risk factors associated with sialolithiasis, thereby improving our understanding of its pathogenesis and paving the way for early diagnosis and intervention. The commonality among the identified risk factors appears to be their association with reduced salivary flow or alterations in fluid dynamics and composition, which are known contributors to the formation of salivary stones.</description>

No biotherapeutic injectable exists that directs laryngeal reinnervation after RLN injury. Placental-derived connective tissue matrix (pd-CTM) could fill this need, as it contains a plethora of cytokines with potential UVFP therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to identify and quantify the factors in a commercially available pd-CTM (CTM Flow, CTM Biomedical, Lake Worth, Florida) and to study the effects of pd-CTM on vocal fold microenvironment and glottic function in a mouse model of unilateral RLN injury. METHODS: Cytokine expression (ng/mL) in pd-CTM was characterized using a cytokine array and ELISA. In a separate experiment, C57/BL6 mice were divided into three groups: uninjured negative controls (n = 12), RLN transection with ipsilateral saline thyroarytenoid (TA) injection (n = 16), and RLN transection with ipsilateral pd-CTM TA injection. Outcomes included laryngeal electromyography (L-EMG) and video laryngoscopy after 7 and 28 days, with larynges then harvested and analyzed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qPCR. RESULTS: pd-CTM characterization showed moderate-to-high levels of neurotrophic (BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, NTF-3), angiogenic (Angiogenin, VEGF-D), tissue remodeling (bFGF, IGF-1, HGF, TGF-β3), and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1Rα). L-EMG demonstrated increased mean normalized area under the curve ratio in pd-CTM treated mice compared to saline treated mice at the 28-day time point indicating reinnervation (p &lt; 0.001). IHC detected innervated neuromuscular junctions 28 days after pd-CTM treatment. CONCLUSION: pd-CTM may be a novel treatment option for patients with UVFP based on the neurotrophic, angiogenic, tissue remodeling, and anti-inflammatory factors present. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.</description>

However, their functional contribution to tumor progression remains unclear. METHODS: We identified and characterized a subset of mitotically active (MA)-PGCCs in human oral squamous cell carcinoma specimens and cell lines. Mitotic activity and cell cycle was assessed using immunofluorescence, time-lapse microscopy and FUCCI. We evaluated the interactions between MA-PGCCs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), focusing on transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling. Chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was analyzed using cell viability assays. RESULTS: MA-PGCCs exhibited both bipolar and multipolar mitosis, generating heterogeneous progeny that contributed to genomic instability. These cells increased the number of CAFs with elevated TGF-β expression, promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhancing resistance to 5-FU. Mechanistically, enhanced reactive oxygen species in MA-PGCCs upregulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR, promoting plasmin-mediated activation of TGF-β secreted from adjacent CAFs. Upregulation of TGF-β receptors in MA-PGCCs further amplified TGF-β signaling, accelerating EMT. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identify MA-PGCCs as a proliferative subpopulation that promotes EMT and chemoresistance through a TGF-β-uPA/uPAR feedback loop. Targeting this pathway may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of aggressive tumors enriched in MA-PGCCs.</description>

While increasingly used, evidence in oncologic populations remains limited. Our objective was to review JIAD in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) and its outcomes. METHODS: Our systematic review was conducted following a predefined protocol (PROSPERO CRD420251043510). Our search strategy was executed on MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Web of Science, and CINAHL from January 2013 to October 2025. Studies with HNC patients of all ages who underwent JIAD were included. The Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Nine studies were included with 57 patients. Common tumour characteristics included mandibular location (n = 31; 54.4 %) and squamous cell carcinoma pathology (n = 37; 64.9 %). A fibular free flap was used in all cases (n = 57; 100 %). Majority underwent adjuvant therapy (n = 36; 63.2 %). Prosthesis survival was reported in 6 studies (n = 25/32; 78.1 %) with follow-up periods ranging from 5 to 52 months. Prosthesis removal was commonly due to osteoradionecrosis (ORN) (n = 6; 10.5 %). All irradiated implants had successful early osseointegration (n = 99; 100 %). Delayed implant failure was reported in 4 patients (n = 4/36; 11.1 %) with 11 implants in radiotherapy field (n = 11/99; 11.1 %). CONCLUSION: JIAD for HNC patients can have high success in majority of select patients/defects. Although early osseointegration rates were high, oncologic patients receiving adjuvant radiation may remain at elevated risk for ORN-associated prosthesis failure. As such, the risks and benefits of JIAD should be carefully reviewed with the patient, and cancer staging should also be considered.</description>

METHODS: Fifty-four patients were randomized into three groups. Group 1 performed 8 weeks of strength training. Groups 2 and 3 combined 4 weeks of strength training with 4 weeks of skill training. Group 3 received high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during training. Group 2 received sham HD-tDCS. RESULTS: Overall adherence and exercise adherence remained above 75% across all groups. Home-based HD-tDCS proved safe and feasible, with mild to moderate side effects (tingling, itching, or burning). Median exercise performance levels for strength training exercises ranged from 94% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the feasibility of high-volume strength and skill training with HD-tDCS in patients with C-RAD. Proactive adherence-supporting factors facilitate high adherence in this population. Both real and sham HD-tDCS proved safe, feasible, and well tolerated.

Proton conformal FLASH treatment aims to deliver pencil beam scanning (PBS) Bragg Peaks to the tumor region with UHDR. In this work, we conducted a treatment planning study for head and neck (H&amp;N) re-irradiation patients using a research-version of a commercial TPS paired with conformal FLASH hardware integrated into a nozzle of a clinical cyclotron-based system. METHODS: Fifteen H&amp;N patients were planned for re-irradiation of 40 GyRBE in 5 fractions to the area of intact tumor. The TPS was configured with validated UHDR beam measurement to generate optimized patient FLASH plans with one or two beams, delivered as single-beam-per-fraction (SBPF). Each beam consists of a deliverable mono-energetic PBS map, a 3D-printable conformal energy modulator design, a selection of aluminum range shifter plates, and a brass aperture. Python scripts with machine-specific delivery timing parameters were used for Monte Carlo dose and dose rate calculations. Clinical VMAT and IMPT plans were also generated for dosimetric comparison. RESULTS: All plans met the tumor target and OAR planning objectives. Conformal FLASH plans showed very similar dose distributions to the clinical IMPT plans. Compared to VMAT plans, both IMPT and FLASH plans have reduced low dose region, maximum cord dose D0.03 cc (8.37 ± 0.94 vs. 3.19 ± 3.81 and 4.32 ± 3.12 GyRBE, respectively), contra-lateral parotid mean dose (1.88 ± 0.99 vs. 0.00 ± 0.01 and 0.00 ± 0.00 GyRBE, respectively) and contra-lateral submandibular gland mean dose (2.49 ± 1.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.13 and 0.19 ± 0.19 GyRBE, respectively). With 500nA quasi-continuous nozzle beam current, the mean dose-averaged dose rate in CTVs of these 15 patients achieved 95.75 ± 22.78 Gy/s. CONCLUSIONS: - We report the deliverable proton conformal FLASH treatment plans for H&amp;N re-irradiation patients using the innovative hardware configuration and measured beam data in our institution. The FLASH plans have very similar plan qualities to clinical IMPT proton plans and were deliverable with our proton machine. The machine specific 3D dose rate distribution can be calculated and displayed in the TPS.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with nonmetastatic NPC treated at two tertiary referral cancer centers in China between January 2012 and December 2018. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the association between MRI-based RLN features and multiple survival endpoints. A simplified RLN risk scoring (RRS) system (incorporating RLN multiplicity, MID, adENE and CNN) was developed in SYSUCC cohort and validated in the GMUCH cohort. A new N classification system was proposed and compared with the 9th edition of AJCC N staging system using C-index. RESULTS: Positive RLNs were observed in 68.3 % of all patients, including 66.7 % (690/1035) in the SYSUCC cohort and 72.0 % (340/472) in the GMUCH cohort. High RRS (defined as RRS &gt; 2) was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.22; 95 % CI, 1.56-3.15, P &lt; 0.001), PFS (HR, 2.45; 95 % CI, 1.87-3.20, P &lt; 0.001), DMFS (HR, 2.71; 95 % CI, 1.88-3.91, P &lt; 0.001), and RFS (HR, 2.20; 95 % CI, 1.51-3.20, P &lt; 0.001). The proposed N classification system incorporated high RRS as a criterion for N3 disease, demonstrated higher C-index values compared with the 9th edition AJCC staging system for OS (0.666 vs 0.659), PFS (0.659 vs 0.639), DMFS (0.682 vs 0.663), and RFS (0.644 vs 0.629). CONCLUSIONS: High RRS was strongly correlated with inferior survival outcomes in NPC patients. Integrating high RRS into the current staging system by reclassifying these patients as N3 might improve prognostic stratification and offer more precise treatment guidance.</description>

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Thirty patients with HNC treated with a manually created IMPT plan were retrospectively included. Dose prescription was 7000 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the primary tumor and 5425 cGy (relative biologic effectiveness) to the bilateral elective nodal volumes. Fully automated IMPT plans were generated using Erasmus-iCycle, applying the same clinical 4-beam configuration and dose constraints. Three experienced HNC ROs independently assessed the automated and corresponding manual plans in a blinded manner. Each RO evaluated both plans, blinded to the planning method, to determine clinical acceptability and indicate their preference, if any. Interobserver differences in preference were evaluated using pairwise McNemar tests. A generalized linear mixed model was used to assess overall preference for automated plans. RESULTS: All 30 automated IMPT plans were considered clinically acceptable, whereas 28 of the 30 manual plans were rated clinically acceptable by all 3 ROs. In 28 out of 30 cases, the ROs unanimously (P = 1.00 between each pair of observers) preferred the automated plan. In the remaining 2 cases, 1 of the 3 ROs had no preference. The manual plan was never preferred. The overall preference for automated plans over no preference was statistically significant (P&lt; .001). Target coverage was considered equivalent, whereas target conformality and sparing of both serial and parallel organs at risk were generally rated superior in the automated plans. CONCLUSIONS: All fully automated IMPT plans for HNC were considered clinically acceptable by experienced HNC ROs. Automated plans were unanimously preferred over manually created plans in nearly all cases, with statistical significance, highlighting the clinical potential of automated IMPT planning tools.</description>

Given the frequency of immunotherapy-related thyroid dysfunction (irTD), there is a growing demand for endocrine consultations, which has led to scheduling delays. This quality improvement project aimed to decrease the time to consultation and normalization of thyroid function tests (TFTs) in patients with irTD. METHODS: Using the Plan-Do-Study-Act framework, a clinic dedicated to the evaluation and treatment of irTD was created. The immuno-oncology toxicity (IOTOX) clinic is staffed by advanced practice providers (APPs) using standardized algorithms and physician support. RESULTS: After implementation, a prospective analysis of 46 patients from the IOTOX clinic was compared with 67 historical control patients seen before implementation. The median consultation wait time improved from 21 to 9 days (P = .01), and the median time to follow-up decreased from 180 to 58 days (P &lt; .001). Notably, the median time to thyroid-stimulating hormone normalization was reduced from 102 to 38 days (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an IOTOX clinic staffed by APPs using standardized algorithms with physician support effectively improved patient access to consultation and expedited the time to normalization of TFTs. This approach can serve as a framework for addressing other irAEs at our institution and has the potential to be implemented or adapted by other institutions to improve the care of patients with irAEs.</description>

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and peripheral T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires are emerging as promising biomarkers for predicting ICB response. Early characterization of ctDNA and TCR dynamics may enable timely treatment adjustments before clinical or radiological progression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The IO-KIN study (NCT04606940) is a single-center, prospective trial involving 15 patients with R/M HNSCC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Blood samples (n=104) were collected across seven timepoints from baseline to day 29. ctDNA was analyzed using a personalized assay (Signatera), and peripheral TCR repertoires were profiled using CapTCR-seq in eight patients. RESULTS: A decline in ctDNA after day 8 was associated with radiological response, longer progression-free survival, and a trend toward improved overall survival. TCR repertoires transiently diversified between days 8-22, with longer diversification windows in patients showing sustained ctDNA decline. Using the GLIPHII algorithm, an EBV-specific TCR signature was identified and persisted in patients with clinical benefit. Additional TCR signatures, potentially recognizing tumor-associated antigens, emerged as early as day 3 and were linked to positive outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous early monitoring of ctDNA and TCR dynamics reveals key determinants of ICB outcomes in R/M HNSCC. The transient nature of TCR diversification emphasizes the importance of precise sample timing to guide early therapeutic decisions and improve patient outcomes.</description>

This study evaluated BM management strategies and patients' outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients diagnosed with DTC and BM at Tel Aviv Sourasky and Rabin Medical Centers between 1985 and 2024. Clinical features, histopathology, treatments, and survival data were collected. RESULTS: Twenty patients were identified: 11 (55%) had papillary thyroid carcinoma, 8 (40%) had follicular carcinoma and 1 had Hurtle cell carcinoma. BM treatments included neurosurgical resection (n = 9), stereotactic radiosurgery (n = 14), and whole-brain radiotherapy (n = 6). Median survival following BM diagnosis was 16.2 months. Patients who did not undergo surgical resection had significantly shorter survival than those whose BM were resected (13 vs. 80 months, p = 0.03). Survival was also worse among patients receiving systemic therapy at the time BM developed (8.9 vs. 80 months, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Unresected BM of DTC and those arising during systemic therapy portend high mortality.</description>

But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.</description>

The specific characteristics and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in these post-transplant patients are not well understood. This study aims to investigate the risk, characteristics, and prognostic outcomes of OSCC in post-transplant patients. METHODS: This study analyzed the clinical baseline characteristics of OSCC patients with pathological confirmation who had undergone organ transplantation (study group) and non-transplant OSCC patients (control group), all of whom were monitored with comprehensive follow-up. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to evaluate whether organ transplantation status was an independent risk factor affecting survival. RESULTS: A total of 103 patients were enrolled (study group, n = 17; control group, n = 86). The median age at OSCC diagnosis for study group was 53 years, with tumors primarily located on the tongue (35.3 %), buccal (17.6 %), and gingiva (11.8 %). Control group had a similar median age, with tumors mostly located on the tongue (64.0 %), buccal (16.3 %), and gingiva (8.1 %). Except for one transplant recipient who received conservative management, all patients underwent surgical resection. Cox multivariate analysis identified tumor recurrence (p = 0.002), tumor size (p = 0.016), and vascular invasion (p = 0.006) as significant adverse factors affecting survival. CONCLUSION: This study emphasizes the importance of organ transplantation history in managing OSCC. Regular screening is essential for early detection and improved survival, particularly under immunosuppressive conditions, in this high-risk group.</description>

This philosophy comes with higher risks of complications and sequela than thyroid lobectomy (TL) and neck dissection alone. There are no prior studies on patients from the Western hemisphere that compare survival and recurrence outcomes between these groups. OBJECTIVE: To compare recurrence and survival outcomes in propensity-matched TL vs TT + RAI patients who presented with ipsilateral N1b PTC at a tertiary cancer center in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort propensity-matched study was conducted at a single US tertiary cancer center included 37 TL patients and 37 of 561 TT + RAI patients (after excluding patients with M1 disease), with a median (IQR) follow-up of 113 (58-241) and 90 (48-185) months, respectively. Adult patients with PTC with lateral neck node metastases (N1b) were identified from a thyroid cancer database. The study included patients undergoing surgery at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1986 to 2020, inclusive, and the study was conducted from 2024 to 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: Of 598 total individuals, the median (IQR) age was 41 (33-55) years, and 341 (57%) were female. The 5-year OS was 96.9% in the TL group and 96.8% in the TT + RAI group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03-1.58). The 5-year DSS was 96.7% in the TL group and 100% in the TT +RAI group. The 5-year RFS was 89.8% in the TL group and 88.9% in the TT + RAI group (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 0.39-5.58). The survival rates did not change between 5 and 10 years. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that a select group of patients with N1b PTC treated with TL had no important difference in survival and recurrence outcomes compared with patients treated with TT + RAI. Therefore, TL is an effective and safe treatment option in carefully selected and appropriately counselled patients with N1b PTC with unilateral tumors and low-volume regional lymph node metastases without clinical extranodal extension.</description>

However, whether pathologic treatment response is a meaningful surrogate end point for survival has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the association between pathologic treatment response and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after neoadjuvant ICI. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed from January 1, 2000, through May 31, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed studies investigating neoadjuvant ICI for the treatment of mucosal HNSCC in patients 18 years and older were identified. Full-length English-language articles that presented pathologic treatment response and survival data (OS and/or DFS) and any association between the 2 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three blinded reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, pathologic treatment response data, and survival data, including hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs when available, according to PRISMA guideline. Data were compiled for statistical analysis to calculate DFS, OS, and HRs using a random-effects model. The I2 index was used to report data heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: HRs for the association of pathologic treatment response with DFS and OS. RESULTS: Eleven trials involving 451 patients met inclusion criteria, with 368 patients included in this meta-analysis. Nine nonrandomized and 2 randomized studies were included, including 7 cohort studies, 2 randomized clinical trials, and 2 retrospective cohort studies, each with a different neoadjuvant ICI regimen. Pooled analysis demonstrated that overall (primary tumor plus lymph node) partial pathologic response (PPR; ≤50% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; I2 = 2.1%) and major pathologic response (MPR; ≤10% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.93; I2 = 0.0%) were both associated with improved DFS up to 2 years. PPR and MPR were not associated with improved OS. Nine of 11 studies were at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study findings suggest that overall PPR and MPR are associated with improved DFS. These data provide additional support for the potential use of pathologic treatment response as a surrogate for DFS after neoadjuvant ICI in resectable mucosal HNSCC.</description>

Malignancies of the sinonasal cavity are particularly rare with an overall incidence of approximately 0.56 cases per 100,000 population per year. Additionally, clinical behavior varies with a reported 5-year overall survival rate ranging from 22% - 67%. Here we describe our initial efforts including formation of an international network dedicated to sinonasal cancer research and highlight keys for successful study of rare tumors. This network first began with large multi-institutional retrospective collaborations of rare sinonasal tumors leading to improvements in staging for olfactory neuroblastoma and sinonasal melanoma. These efforts have been followed by a new emphasis on development of collaborative interventional trials as well as the development of position statements and recommendations to guide use of emerging molecularly targeted therapies. In order to be successful in studying rare malignancies, collaboration and teamwork is key along with an unrelenting drive for development of evidence to help guide treatment for rare cancers. This manuscript serves as an outline that may be applied by other interested groups to improve the study of other tumors in the human body.</description>

However, the relative advantages of mechanical stapling compared to hand-sewn techniques for cervical esophagojejunal anastomosis remain unclear. This study aimed to compare postoperative outcomes between these two approaches. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study. SETTING: Tertiary academic medical center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review on 28 patients undergoing free jejunal transfer after total pharyngolaryngectomy between 2014 and 2020. Patients were divided into a mechanical stapler group (n = 12) and a hand-sewn group (n = 16). Outcomes assessed included postoperative complications within 30 days and functional outcomes at or beyond 6 months postoperatively (mechanical stapler: n = 8; hand-sewn: n = 10). We conducted statistical analysis using Fisher's exact and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: The overall incidence of early postoperative complications was similar between groups. Median operative time was significantly shorter with mechanical stapling (437 vs 540 minutes; P = .002). Functional outcomes, including oral intake and dysphagia symptoms, showed no significant differences. Nasal regurgitation was less frequent with stapling (37.5% vs 90%; P = .043). One anastomotic stricture occurred in the stapler group and we successfully treated it with two sessions of endoscopic balloon dilatation. CONCLUSION: Mechanical stapling provides comparable functional outcomes to hand-sewn anastomosis while offering the advantage of shorter operative time. These findings support its use as a practical and efficient alternative for cervical esophagojejunal reconstruction following total pharyngolaryngectomy, particularly in settings seeking to optimize both efficiency and safety.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Single-center, tertiary academic facial nerve clinic. METHODS: Adults with inflammatory, schwannoma, parotid neoplasm, or congenital facial paralysis completed FACE-Q modules, the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), and a social support rating. Facial paralysis severity was graded with Sunnybrook scores. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post hoc testing along with multivariable linear regression assessed associations between etiology and outcomes, adjusting for severity, duration, prior surgical procedures, emotional intelligence, and social support. RESULTS: Etiology independently shaped patient experience in multiple domains. Compared with inflammatory paralysis, parotid neoplasm was associated with worse lip appearance (β = -12.07, SE = 5.05, P = .036), speech function (β = -16.16, SE = 6.40, P = .010), and speech-related distress (β = -5.51, SE = 2.11, P = .009). Congenital paralysis was linked to lower appearance distress (β = 12.81, SE = 5.30, P = .017) and higher social functioning (β = 17.48, SE = 7.13, P = .028). Schwannoma resection had improved facial appearance (β = 7.96, SE = 3.03, P = .020) and psychological function (β = 6.83, SE = 2.89, P = .037). Across etiologies, higher baseline emotional intelligence improved appearance, psychosocial, and functional perceptions, while stronger social support mitigated speech-related distress and outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patient-reported outcomes and lived experience in facial paralysis differ meaningfully by etiology. Beyond clinical severity, a patient's emotional intelligence, social context, and underlying cause of paralysis shape personal perceptions of appearance, function, and well-being. These findings highlight the importance of etiology-specific counseling, rehabilitation, and psychosocial support to optimize recovery and quality of life.</description>

The survival equivalence of surgery versus chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for cT4a laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cT4a LSCC patients treated with curative-intent surgery or CRT using the National Cancer Database (2010-2021). Those receiving neoadjuvant or palliative therapy, or with distant metastases were excluded. Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox models after 1:1 propensity score matching. RESULTS: Among 3569 patients (mean age 61.0, 708 female), 2437 (68.3%) underwent surgery while 1132 (31.7%) received CRT. In the matched cohort (n = 452 per arm), median survival was 52.8 (95% CI: 45.6-62.4) versus 37.6 (95% CI: 29.2-45.4) months for surgery versus CRT. Adjusted HR for CRT relative to surgery was 1.26 (95% CI: 1.02-1.57). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery was associated with improved overall survival compared with definitive CRT in patients with T4a LSCC.</description>

Studies have shown that neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) are potential prognostic markers in p16-negative LASCCL. This study analyzes the predictive value of NLR and LMR. METHODS: Samples from 193 LASCCL patients treated with chemotherapy were reviewed. Response to induction chemotherapy was tested with logistic regression. Optimal cut-points were determined by Youden's index. Survival was tested with Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: LMR had a positive association, NLR had a negative association with response to chemotherapy (p = 0.004;0.07). Response was higher in patients with LMR ≥ 2.8 (p = 0.0007) and NLR ≤ 2.8 (p = 0.04). Overall and disease-specific survival improved with LMR ≥ 2.8 (p = 0.0002;0.004) and NLR ≤ 2.8 (p = 0.10;0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Low NLR and high LMR were associated with favorable responses to chemotherapy and survival in LASCCL.</description>

METHODS: As described in our previous report, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey targeting 782 institutions, asking about the presence of RRP patients during the survey period in 2018 and 2019. A detailed questionnaire was subsequently sent to the 196 institutions that reported having at least one patient, inquiring about age, sex, history of recent surgery, Derkay's score, surgical procedures, and postoperative recurrence. The present study analyzed data from patients who had been diagnosed prior to the beginning of the survey period. RESULTS: Data on 318 previously diagnosed patients were collected from 90 institutions. At their first follow-up visit during the survey period, 85 patients (26.7%) had a Derkay's anatomical score of 0. The true vocal folds were the most commonly affected laryngeal subsites. Of the 318 patients, 165 underwent surgery after the first follow-up visit, and recurrence occurred in 106 after this surgery. The 6- and 12-month additional surgery-free rates were 58.9% and 31.8%. These rates were significantly higher in patients who had undergone one or no surgery within a year prior to the first follow-up visit during the survey period than in those who had undergone two or more surgeries (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed real-world data suggesting that the number of recent surgeries and Derkay's anatomical score may be associated with the clinical course of previously diagnosed RRP.</description>

This study aimed to assess the thematic focus and clinical representation of otorhinolaryngology-themed ASMR videos using a novel expert-based scoring system and to examine their relationship with viewer engagement. METHODS: Fifty-six YouTube ASMR videos were analyzed and categorized by subspecialty, procedures, and engagement metrics. A clinical representation score (CRS) was developed to assess the degree of clinical representation, and inter-rater reliability for the total score was evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Viewer interaction was measured using video view rate (VVR) and daily engagement rate (DER). Pearson correlation and ANOVA were used (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Otologic content predominated (96.4%), with otoscopy (89.3%) and earwax removal (53.6%) most common. Rhinologic (33.9%) and head and neck (41.1%) content were underrepresented. Endoscopic or surgical procedures appeared only once each (1.8%). No video addressed facial plastic surgery. Most videos showed moderate (58.7%) or low (28.3%) clinical representation; only one (2.2%) achieved high CRS. A significant inverse correlation was found between CRS and both VVR (r = -0.38, p &lt; 0.01) and DER (r = -0.56, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: This first cross-sectional content analysis of otorhinolaryngology-themed ASMR videos reveals a dominance of otologic content with limited clinical accuracy or scope. The inverse association between CRS and viewer engagement suggests that the most popular videos may offer the least clinical realism. Although not educational in intent, their widespread reach raises important concerns about shaping public expectations of otolaryngologic care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

This study aimed to identify perioperative and postoperative factors linked to LOI in geriatric HNC patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using 2021-2023 ACS-NSQIP data. Patients aged ≥ 75 years who underwent HNC surgery with preoperative and discharge functional status data were included. The primary outcome was LOI, defined as a decline in functional status at discharge compared to baseline. Logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of LOI. RESULTS: Among 4290 patients, 471 (10.9%) experienced LOI. LOI was associated with diabetes (p = 0.001), metastatic disease (p = 0.037), smoking (p = 0.001), dementia (p &lt; 0.0001), and falling within 6 months (p &lt; 0.0001). Longer operative times (mean 320.89 vs. 63.68 min, p &lt; 0.0001) and hospital stays ≥ 2 days (p &lt; 0.0001) were associated with LOI. Overweight and obese patients had lower odds of LOI (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: [0.57, 0.98]; OR: 0.70, 95% CI: [0.52, 0.95]). Operative time &gt; 5 h (OR: 1.66, 95% CI: [1.1-2.35]) and length of stay ≥ 2 days (OR: 2.13, 95% CI: [1.48-3.07]) were associated with LOI. Surgical procedures linked to higher odds included free flap (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: [1.70-8.39]), laryngeal resection (OR: 3.99, 95% CI: [1.40-11.34]), neck dissection (OR: 2.78, 95% CI: [1.29-5.99]), regional flap (OR: 3.85, 95% CI: [1.80-8.27]), and total glossectomy (OR: 2.65, 95% CI: [1.02-6.86]). CONCLUSION: Identifying patients at risk for LOI may guide surgical decision-making in older adults undergoing HNC surgery.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of subjects undergoing otolaryngologic surgery was performed using the 2016 to 2021 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). The incidence of CDI and potential risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-five surgical encounters experienced postoperative CDI out of 149 960, with a CDI incidence of 0.12% (8.8 cases per 10,000 patient-days). The greatest number of postoperative CDI was observed in head and neck reconstructive surgeries. On bivariate analysis, risk factors significantly and practically associated with the occurrence of CDI after otolaryngologic surgery were older age and longer operating times. Multiple logistic regression revealed that the CDI rate did not differ among otolaryngology subspecialties but was influenced by age, functional status, and operating times after controlling for relevant confounders. CONCLUSIONS: CDI after otolaryngologic surgery is a serious, costly complication with an incidence comparable to the national CDI rate. Knowledge of the preoperative risk factors associated with CDI may aid in the prevention of such infection after otolaryngologic procedures, thus decreasing patient morbidity and healthcare cost.</description>

Despite the fact that TNM staging provides a global framework, regional patterns of metastasis, comorbidity interaction and concordance between imaging and pathology are not uniformly represented. This study will investigate nodal disease patterns in a group of people in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) and will suggest more specific treatments. The research aims to facilitate early diagnosis and intervention pathways and to reduce inequality in healthcare service provision. METHODS: Twenty patients with OSCC who had been diagnosed between 2023 and 2025 were the subjects of a retrospective study conducted on tertiary oncology centres in Delhi NCR. Inclusion criteria were confirmation of primary OSCC of the tongue or buccal mucosa, availability of PET -CT or MRI images, full TNM staging, and comorbidity information. Data visualization included heatmaps, scatter plot, cluster diagram and radar charts. Along with the imaging concordance, tumour site, the size of the lesion, nodal involvement, and the burden of comorbidity were evaluated. RESULTS: Bilateral nodal involvement was higher in the Tongue OSCC, mostly at Level II and III, but the tumours of the buccal mucosa were mostly limited to Level Ib unilateral. Nodal burden was much higher in lesions of around 3.5 cm. Comorbidities (diabetes and chronic kidney disease) were also related to higher FDG uptake and necrosis, but the relationships were not statistically significant. PET-CT had 85 percent agreement with the pathology of the surgery. The decision of treatment was based on the staging with surgery being the preferred treatment option in early disease and chemoradiation in advanced ones. CONCLUSION: The site and size of tumour have a significant impact on nodal dissemination in OSCC. Bilateral neck dissection can be a wise option in case of early tongue lesions involving the midline but selective unilateral dissection is adequate in selecting cases involving the buccal lesions. It is necessary to couple comorbidity profiling with imaging results when planning pre-treatment. In this study, health systems, health equity, and collaborative oncology care are strengthened.</description>

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 257 R/M NPC patients who achieved disease control after chemo-immunotherapy and received either Immu/Cape or Immu maintenance. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics. Endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Following PSM, the Immu/Cape group exhibited prolonged PFS (median, 27.87 vs 8.5 months, p = 0.016) and OS (3-year rate, 80.8% vs. 65.4%; p = 0.027). This survival benefit was most pronounced in patients with high-burden disease: &gt;5 metastatic lesions, ≥2 involved organs, or detectable post-treatment EBV DNA. The primary toxicity was hand-foot syndrome, with a higher incidence in the Immu/Cape group (53.7% vs. 9.8%; p &lt; 0.001), including 12.2% grade 3-4 events; other severe adverse events were comparable. CONCLUSION: This study provides hypothesis-generating evidence that Immu/Cape maintenance may improve survival in R/M NPC, especially for high-risk patients. Prospective, randomized trials are required to validate this strategy before it can be considered practice-changing.</description>

In 2024, approximately 71 110 individuals in the US were diagnosed with head and neck cancer, and it accounted for 16 110 deaths. OBSERVATIONS: Approximately 90% of head and neck cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Worldwide, tobacco and alcohol use are the most prevalent risk factors. In the US and Europe, 60% to 70% of newly diagnosed oropharynx cancers (a subset of head and neck cancers) are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. At presentation, approximately 30% of patients with head and neck cancer have early-stage or localized disease (tumor &lt;4 cm without regional lymph nodes involvement), 60% have locoregionally advanced disease (tumor ≥4 cm with local invasion and/or regional lymphadenopathy) and 10% have metastatic disease. Up to 10% of oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas present as squamous cell carcinomas of unknown primary. Standard treatment for localized head and neck cancer is surgery or radiotherapy, which are each associated with a 5-year overall survival rate of 70% to 90%. For locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, multimodality treatment includes surgery followed by postoperative radiation with or without chemotherapy or concomitant chemotherapy (with cisplatin as the preferred agent), and radiation with surgery is reserved for persistent or recurrent disease. With these treatments for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer, 5-year overall survival rates are 25% to 60% and more than 80% for HPV-associated oropharynx cancer. Choice of treatment for locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer should involve shared decision-making and consideration of effects on speech and swallow function and appearance. First-line treatment for patients with incurable locoregional recurrences or distant metastatic disease is immunotherapy with programmed death ligand-1 inhibition (ie, pembrolizumab) alone or in combination with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. With treatment, patients with incurable locoregional recurrences or distant metastatic disease have a median survival of 12 to 15 months, and 5-year survival rates are less than 20%. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common cancer worldwide. In the US and Europe, 60% to 70% of incident oropharynx cancers are associated with HPV infection. Standard treatment for localized head and neck cancer is surgery or radiotherapy. Locoregionally advanced disease is treated with surgery followed by radiation with or without chemotherapy or concurrent chemoradiation. First-line treatment for advanced disease is immunotherapy alone or with chemotherapy.</description>

To identify strategies to overcome anoikis resistance, we employed a 3D suspension culture model combined with proteomic screening, identifying a relationship between the dynamin-like protein Drp1 and anoikis resistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Drp1 facilitated the generation of new mitochondria and the removal of damaged ones by regulating fission and mitophagy, thereby enabling tumor cells to overcome anoikis. Furthermore, the interaction of Drp1 and BIP was enhanced during anoikis resistance, which increased formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) to maintain mitochondrial dynamic equilibrium. Mechanistically, CaMKKβ activated the AMPK-MFF-Drp1 and AMPK-mTOR-Drp1 pathways through O-GlcNAcylation modification, thus recruiting Drp1 to MAMs. Notably, the Drp1-BIP complex served as a prognostic indicator for NPC clinical outcome and metastatic risk. Collectively, these results elucidate a mechanism by which Drp1 regulates anoikis resistance through mitochondrial dynamics and provide a feasible treatment strategy for managing NPC.</description>

While the sublabial approach to the maxillary sinus has been widely described, contemporary plating methods may reduce historical drawbacks which include oroantral fistula, maxillary sinusitis, and facial asymmetry. METHODS: Four patients underwent en bloc removal of the antero-lateral maxillary wall for removal of intra-antral pathology, with bony lid reconstruction using contemporary plating methods. Clinical course, complications, and follow-up information were examined. RESULTS: Diagnoses included keratocystic odontogenic tumor, foreign body (displaced tooth), bony cyst, and juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. All patients underwent successful surgery with excellent exposure of the maxillary sinus and reapproximation of the bony lid. Long-term follow-up radiograph of 1 patient showed excellent position of the bony lid with no mucosal thickening. CONCLUSIONS: Re-apposition of a bony lid after a sublabial approach to the maxillary sinus could ameliorate historical drawbacks of the procedure, possibly expanding its application. Larger cohorts and long-term follow-up will further characterize ideal indications and potential pitfalls of the approach.</description>

METHODS: A total of 224 patients treated between 2005 and 2016 were analyzed. WPOI-5 was defined as tumor satellites ≥ 1 mm from the main tumor or nearest satellite. Its prognostic impact on cancer-specific survival (CSS) and locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) was assessed, and a WPOI-5-based nomogram was developed. RESULTS: Patients with WPOI-5 had significantly worse 5-year CSS and LRRFS (both p &lt; 0.001). In Cox analysis, WPOI-5 independently predicted poorer CSS (HR 6.908, p = 0.006) and LRRFS (HR 14.910, p &lt; 0.001). Adding WPOI-5 improved the nomogram's 5-year LRRFS AUC from 0.789 to 0.842. CONCLUSIONS: WPOI-5 is an adverse prognostic factor in pathologically early-stage, low-risk OTSCC and may justify trials of adjuvant therapy in these patients.</description>

Risk prediction remains challenging due to limited data. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study including 294 patients who underwent fibula free flap reconstruction and adjuvant RT. A predictive nomogram for ORN was developed using logistic regression with stepwise backward selection, validated via 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: ORN occurred in 9.9% of patients. Eight variables were retained in the final model, which demonstrated excellent discrimination (AUC = 0.94) and good calibration (mean absolute error = 0.017). The optimal threshold for classification was 0.30, with the model achieving a sensitivity of 1.0, specificity of 0.80, and an overall accuracy of 0.82. CONCLUSION: This is the first nomogram developed to predict ORN following fibula free flap mandibular reconstruction. It provides a personalized risk estimate, supporting individualized clinical decision-making and improved pre- and postoperative planning. Prospective validation is warranted.</description>

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to quantify the risk of specific UADT cancers in individuals with GERD. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL was conducted for studies published from January 2000 to October 2024. REVIEW METHODS: Observational studies (cohort or case-control) evaluating GERD as a risk factor for UADT cancers in adults were included, following PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD42024602545). Esophageal adenocarcinoma was excluded due to its well-established association with GERD. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Pooled relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects models. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (12 case-control, 5 cohort), encompassing 1,768,394 participants, met inclusion criteria. GERD was significantly associated with laryngeal cancer (RR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.19-2.31). No significant associations were found for pharyngeal, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, or esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Subgroup analysis showed stronger associations in U.S.-based studies (RR = 1.61) and in studies using ICD-coded GERD (RR = 1.93). CONCLUSION: GERD is associated with an increased risk of laryngeal cancer. Findings support further investigation into reflux-related carcinogenesis in the UADT, particularly in high-risk populations.</description>

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between immune checkpoint regulators and survival among patients with SDC. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study was performed at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine Affiliated Renji Hospital and Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between April 2006 and November 2016. Subjects were SDC patients meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the expression level of 5 immune checkpoint regulators (positive vs negative): programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 3 (TIM-3). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary and secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival. COVARIATES: The covariates were subjects' demographics, tumor characteristics, and androgen receptor (AR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. ANALYSES: Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression models. Subtype comparisons were made using Pearson χ2 or Fisher's exact test. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.26. Statistical significance was P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The sample composed 54 subjects with a mean age of 59.39 years (SD 13.35) and 81% were male. PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3, AR, and HER2 positivity rates were 37, 31, 33, 15, 44, 67, and 24%, respectively (P &lt; .001). The DFS was worse in subjects positive for HER2, PD-1, PD-L1, or CTLA-4 (all P &lt; .05), whereas positivity for LAG-3 or TIM-3 was not associated with DFS. Multivariate analysis identified PD-1/PD-L1 co-positivity as an independent negative prognostic factor for DFS (HR = 2.69, P = .02). HER2 positivity was also an independent predictor of poorer overall survival (P = .003). No significant differences in immune checkpoint regulator expression were observed across subtypes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, and HER2 positivity are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in SDC. Immune checkpoint regulator expression was comparable among AR/HER2 subtypes. PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 are potential therapeutic targets for SDC, particularly for the HER2/AR double-negative subtype.</description>

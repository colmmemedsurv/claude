      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sousa-Neto SS, Nakamura TCR, Dos Santos GC, Giraldo-Roldan D, Gonçalves MWA, de Cáceres CVBL, Fonseca FP, Moreira VHLO, Mendonça EF, Martins MD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.09.018'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.09.018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Mar-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41591939/'&gt;41591939&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Although artificial intelligence tools show promise for enhancing the diagnosis of head and neck lesions, few studies have tested these resources for the microscopic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. Specifically, the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinoma and secretory carcinoma has never been addressed in this context. Therefore, this exploratory study aimed to comparatively evaluate the feasibility of applying convolutional neural networks for the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinomas and secretory carcinomas. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using whole-slide images from 46 patients with acinic cell carcinoma (n = 26) or secretory carcinoma (n = 20) was conducted. Eight CNNs (ResNet-50, InceptionV3, VGG16, Xception, MobileNet, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0, and EfficientNetV2B0) were trained and evaluated for accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and AUC. Performance was measured in training, validation, and test subsets. Accuracy and loss curves were also presented. RESULTS: InceptionV3 demonstrated the best overall performance, with the lowest loss (1.39), highest accuracy (0.81), sensitivity (0.90), and F1-score (0.81). VGG16 achieved the highest AUC (0.86) and precision (0.77). DenseNet121 showed the lowest performance in terms of accuracy (0.65) and F1-Score (0.52), but the highest specificity (0.85). CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study suggests that convolutional neural networks may be feasible tools to support the microscopic differentiation between acinic cell carcinoma and secretory carcinoma. The performance of these models critically depends on the size of the dataset and the quality of annotations. The findings should be interpreted cautiously given the limited dataset and potential sources of bias. Further validation with larger, multicenter datasets is needed before any clinical application can be considered.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Prasad M, Cheng AT, Mayer M, Jansen L, Koh E, Nadeem Z, Sivan Pillai G, Vos J, Kuo F, Zhao K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3972'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3972&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41603724/'&gt;41603724&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Recurrent and metastatic human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HPV+ HNSCC) remains largely incurable, with genetic drivers incompletely defined. We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

Whether the same prognostic significance holds with surgical treatment such as transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is less well studied. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary care academic center. METHODS: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC treated with TORS from January 2016 to December 2023 were included. Demographics, smoking history, disease characteristics, treatment, and oncologic outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 156 patients were included. 87.2% were male with median age 60.0 years. Seventy-seven were never smokers, 63 former smokers, and 16 current smokers, with a median 20 pack-years among ever smokers. Three local, 6 regional, and ten distant metastases were identified, with 6 deaths, over a median 2.2 years of follow up. When comparing never, former, and current smokers, ever smokers demonstrated more advanced pathologic nodal staging (P = .03) and extranodal extension (P = .05). When comparing never and ever smokers, never smokers were younger (P = .04), and primary site differed with borderline significance (P = .05). Ever smokers again had more advanced nodal stage (P = .01) and extranodal extension (P = .02). There were no significant differences in adjuvant treatment, disease recurrence, or death by smoking history. There were no significant differences apart from age when analyzed using a 10 or 20-pack-year smoking history cutoff (P = .01, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Smoking history is associated with more advanced nodal stage and extranodal extension. However, smoking does not appear to influence recurrence or death in the setting of HPV-associated OPSCC definitively treated with TORS.</description>

This prospective cohort study aimed to describe the longitudinal changes in swallowing and oral intake and assess the influence of adjuvant treatment modalities. We included 89 patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Swallowing was assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months post-surgery using Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), Swallowing Ability and Safety Scale (SASS), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Patients were stratified by adjuvant treatment: none, radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy. Swallowing recovery was dynamic. EAT-10 scores increased from 8.8 at 1 month to peak at 13.5 at 3 months (p &lt; 0.001), before decreasing to 8.3 at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001). Penetration/aspiration for thin liquids significantly increased from 32.6% at 1 month to 44.9% at 3 months (p = 0.034), then decreased to 31.5% at 6 months (p = 0.014). FOIS and SASS scores showed overall improvement from 1 to 6 months (p &lt; 0.001 for both), despite a transient dip in FOIS and a rise in poor SASS scores at 3 months. Patients receiving chemoradiotherapy demonstrated greater perceived dysphagia, lower functional oral intake, and higher rates of thin liquid penetration/aspiration compared to other groups across all time points. In conclusion, chemoradiotherapy is associated with more severe and prolonged dysphagia. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted rehabilitation and comprehensive multidisciplinary care.</description>

Previous work revealed reduced proportions and cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells in ATC tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, we investigated the role of super-enhancers (SEs), clusters of adjacent enhancers and drive high expression of genes, in reshaping the TME in ATC. Comprehensive profiling of the SE landscapes in ATC revealed activation of oncogenic SEs as a mechanism underlying the dedifferentiation and anaplastic transformation of thyroid cancer. An SE signature based on recurrent SEs in ATC was associated with significantly shortened overall patient survival. FOSL1 was identified as an SE-driven transcriptional factor that was crucial for epigenetic remodeling of ATC cells. Interestingly, FOSL1 bound to its own SE, promoted chromatin looping and spatial proximity of the distal SE with its promoter, and maintained its high expression, forming a positive feedback self-regulation circuit. During ATC progression, FOSL1 boosted expression of metalloproteinases ADAM9 and MMP14 via binding to their SEs, which promoted MICA shedding from the cell surface and led to subsequent immune escape from NK cell killing. Silencing FOSL1, ADAM9, or MMP9 sensitized ATC cells to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and suppressed ATC growth in vivo. Together, these findings highlight the role of FOSL1 in chromatin remodeling of ATC and in dampening cytotoxic functions of NK cells, thereby providing insights into the development of potential cancer therapeutics.</description>

To gain insight into biological mechanisms that cause DNA damage resistance and to inform strategies for achieving synergy with therapeutic radiation, we performed parallel pooled genetic CRISPR-Cas9 screening for survival in high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) subtypes. Surprisingly, in addition to known mediators of radiotherapy response, including ATM, DNAPK, and NF-κB signaling, loss of JAK1 was identified as a driver of tumor cell radioresistance. Knockout of JAK1 in HNSCC increased cell survival by enhancing the DNA damage-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest and delaying progression to radiation-induced mitotic catastrophe. In line with this finding, both JAK1 knockout and kinase inhibition with abrocitinib prevented subsequent formation of radiation-induced micronuclei. Loss of JAK1 function did not affect canonical CDK1 signaling but instead reduced activation of PLK1 and AURKA, two kinases with auxiliary roles in the regulation of G2 and M phase progression. Correspondingly, using both EdU labelling and live cell imaging techniques, JAK1 loss was found to cause prolonged metaphase, mitotic slippage, and progression to tetraploidy. Targeting the mitotic kinesin KIF18A with the small molecule sovilnesib exacerbated mitotic stress and enhanced the efficacy of radiation. These studies establish KIF18A inhibition as a strategy to counteract the protective G2/M cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and to thus enhance tumor cell sensitivity to radiation therapy.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 578 patients with early-stage OSCC (cT1-3N0) who underwent US-FNAC prior to surgery. Histopathology, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and follow-up were used as reference standards. RESULTS: Occult nodal metastases were found in 179 patients (31.0%). US-FNAC showed low sensitivity (15.9%) and a negative predictive value of 72.9%, resulting in 149 false-negative cases (25.8%). Specificity (99.5%) and positive predictive value (90.3%) were high, with only 2 false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and a clinically negative neck, US-FNAC demonstrates high specificity but limited sensitivity and negative predictive value. These findings indicate that US-FNAC alone is insufficient to exclude occult nodal metastases and should be regarded as an adjunctive diagnostic tool rather than a stand-alone nodal staging strategy.</description>

This study aims to explore the optimal extent of LND and discover a personalized and accurate surgical plan for pN1 PTC patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 550 patients with PTC who underwent initial surgery. For patients who were considered pN1a, LND of levels III and IV was completed. For patients who were considered LNM in levels III or IV, after taking 3-6 lymph nodes of level III for frozen pathological examination, if LNM was found, LND of levels II-IV was performed; otherwise, only levels III and IV were dissected, For patients who were considered to have LNM in level II, LND of levels II-V was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: 51.4% of patients with pN1a had postoperative pathologically confirmed occult LNM in levels III and IV. Among patients who underwent LND of levels II-IV due to positive lymph nodes in level III, 46.1% had occult LNM in level II. For patients with LNM in level II, the incidence of occult metastasis in level V was 20%. Only one patient presented with lymph node recurrence outside of the operative field. The proportion of patients with postoperative complications increased as the scope of dissection enlarged. CONCLUSION: Combined with the distribution of LNM and the number of subregions of LNM(n) in preoperative ultrasonography, it is suggested that the range of LND in the lateral neck of pN1 PTC should be n + 1/2 anatomical subregions.</description>

METHOD: In this retrospective diagnostic study, 310 patients with pathologically confirmed papillary thyroid carcinoma from two hospitals were included. We trained ViT models for B-mode and SMI, then extracted ViT and radiomics features from their video images. Initially, Single-modality models were developed, including the B-mode radiomics model (BMUS_RAD) and the B-mode ViT model (BMUS_ViT). Subsequently, Dual-modality models were constructed, encompassing the Dual-modality radiomics model (DMU_RAD), the Dual-modality ViT model (DMU_ViT), and finally, the integrated model DMU_RAD_ViT, to enhance the prediction of CLNM. The performance of each model was compared, and SHAP was utilized for the visual interpretation of the novel fusion model. RESULTS: Among all the models, the fusion model DMU_RAD_ViT performed the best (AUC = 0.901, p &lt; 0.05). At the same time, the dual-modality model DMU_RAD(AUC = 0.856) and DMU_ViT(AUC = 0.832) is also higher than the single-modal model BMUS_RAD (AUC = 0.837) and BMUS_ViT (AUC = 0.789), respectively. SHAP analysis revealed that 16 radiomics and ViT features from both modalities contributed to the DMU_RAD_ViT model. CONCLUSIONS: The Dual-modality fusion model, integrating both radiomics and ViT features, can be utilized to predict CLNM.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: 2019 Patient User File of the National Cancer Database. METHODS: Patients &gt;18 years of age with OPC were stratified based on margin status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical variables associated with PM. Survival analyses were performed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and hazard ratios (aHRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. RESULTS: In total, 4294 patients met the criteria. The PM rate was 16.6%. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa), salivary gland carcinoma, clinical T category, base of tongue primary site, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with PM. PMs were associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.40-1.99). In patients with PM, but without extranodal extension (ENE), adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) (aHR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (aCRT) (aHR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45) were associated with an improvement in OS versus surgery alone; however, OS between aRT and aCRT was similar for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCa. CONCLUSION: Histologic type, clinical T category, tumor subsite, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with TORS PM. aCRT did not confer a survival benefit over aRT in the overall cohort, or in subgroups of HPV-associated or HPV-negative SCCa patients with PM without ENE.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Retrospective nationwide database review. METHODS: Genomic data from 130 OCA samples, representing 124 adult patients, were retrieved from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics, Evidence, and Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) database (v17.0-public). Analysis focused on nonsynonymous somatic mutations identified via whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted panel sequencing after standardized filtering. Mutation frequencies, enrichment based on gender and metastatic status (primary vs. metastatic), and patterns of co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequently mutated genes were TERT (33.1%, predominantly promoter mutations), TP53 (20.0%), DAXX (16.2%), KMT2D (13.1%), NF1 (12.3%), and PTEN (10.0%). Significant gender-specific enrichment was identified, notably MST1R mutations exclusive to females (10.7%) and PRKDC mutations exclusive to males (16.7%). Mutations in PC, PCLO, MEN1, and TSC2 were significantly enriched in metastatic samples. DAXX and CDKN1A mutations exhibited significant co-occurrence, whereas TERT mutations were mutually exclusive with DAXX alterations. CONCLUSION: The genomic landscape of OCA is marked by frequent TERT promoter mutations and distinct mutational patterns associated with patient gender and tumor metastatic status. These findings highlight potential molecular subtypes, reveal pathways potentially driving metastasis (eg, involving MEN1/TSC2), and identify novel sex-specific alterations (MST1R, PRKDC), offering avenues for improved development of targeted therapeutic strategies for OCA.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Non-metastatic NPC patients treated between 2017 and 2018 were screened. MRI data were reviewed for re-staging according to the TNM-9 and iENE status per the HNCIG-criteria. Five-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) based on the ordinal N category of TNM-9 and the G2 iENE status were performed to propose a refined N category. RESULTS: Totally, 1334 patients were included, with 462 (34.6%) patients presenting with G2 iENE at baseline. Besides N Category, G2 iENE also showed independent prognostic value for OS (HR: 1.453, P = 0.042), PFS (HR: 1.293, P = 0.057) and DMFS (HR: 1.363, P = 0.042). The RPA-N category was then derived: RPA-N0 (N0), RPA-N1 (N1 without G2 iENE), RPA-N2 (N1 with G2 iENE and N2) and RPA-N3 (N3). The RPA-N classification had a lower Akaike information criterion (AIC) and higher C-index for all endpoints, and performed better in hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, sample size balance and outcome prediction when compared to TNM-9. CONCLUSIONS: G2 iENE, based on the HNCIG-criteria, constitute an independent adverse prognostic factor for NPC based on the TNM-9. The RPA-N category, which integrated N category of TNM-9 and G2 iENE, demonstrated better performance than N category in TNM-9, further validation in multicenter cohorts is warranted.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 500 NPC patients from four hospitals were allocated to training (n = 274), internal testing (n = 118), and external testing cohorts (n = 108). Rad features were extracted from MRI-defined carotid artery regions of interest, SRad features from K-means-derived subregions, and deep features from a SwinT backbone. Single-source and fusion models were developed. Discrimination (AUC), classification (ACC/SEN/SPE), calibration (Brier score and calibration curves), reclassification (NRI/IDI), and interpretability (SHAP) were assessed. RESULTS: RICAI was observed in 48.5%, 48.3%, and 54.6% of the training, internal testing, and external testing cohorts, respectively. Among single-source models, SwinT and SRad showed comparable performance, with Rad slightly inferior; all outperformed the clinical model. The fused Rad-SRad-SwinT achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.737-0.891) in internal testing and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.794-0.932) in external testing, alongside favorable classification in external testing (ACC 0.815, SEN 0.763, SPE 0.878) and good calibration (Brier score 0.148). NRI/IDI analyses indicated significantly improved reclassification versus single-source models. SHAP analyses demonstrated that SwinT-derived features contributed most to model decisions, followed by SRad and Rad, supporting complementary gains from deep semantic representation and subregional heterogeneity quantification. CONCLUSION: Integrating multilevel radiomics with Transformer-derived deep learning features enhances prediction of RICAI after NPC radiotherapy and shows promise as a noninvasive risk-stratification tool.</description>

Dabrafenib plus trametinib has shown efficacy in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC, but effective therapies remain limited for patients without this mutation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus sintilimab in BRAFV600E-negative ATC. METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, patients with BRAFV600E-negative unresectable or metastatic ATC received anlotinib (12 mg orally once daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) plus sintilimab (200 mg intravenously on day 1). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered at www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2200067045. RESULTS: From December 27, 2022, to June 11, 2025, 21 patients were enrolled. One (4.8%) patient achieved complete response, and nine (42.9%) patients achieved partial response. The ORR and disease control rate were 47.6% (10/21) and 85.7% (18/21), respectively. After median follow-up of 9.97 months (confidence interval [CI] 6.10 to NA), 61.9% (13/21) of patients had discontinued treatment, mainly due to disease progression (7/21, 33.3%), adverse events (AEs) (2/21, 9.5%), and other reasons (4/21, 19.0%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.63 months (CI 4.03 to NA), with eight (38.1%) patients were still on treatment. Subgroup analysis showed longer PFS in patients with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio &lt;3.06 (18.43 vs. 3.67 months; p = 0.010) and &lt;5 (14.23 vs. 2.67 months; p = 0.002). Median overall survival was not reached (CI 13.90 to NA), 15 (71.4%) patients remained alive. AEs occurred in 66.7% (14/21) of patients, including grade 3 AEs in 19.0% (4/21). The most common were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (6/21, 28.6%) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (5/21, 23.8%). Grade 3 immune-related AEs occurred in three patients, including AST/ALT increased, diarrhea, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. CONCLUSIONS: Anlotinib plus sintilimab showed favorable efficacy and manageable safety in BRAFV600E-negative unresectable or metastatic ATC, supporting further investigation.</description>

Although tissue biopsy remains the "gold-standard," analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may offer an alternative to characterize mutations necessary to initiate systemic therapy with selective inhibitors in eligible patients. This study aimed to identify cases of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (sMTC) in which plasma ctDNA analysis may be useful for RET gene testing when tumor tissue is unavailable. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing plasma from 36 patients affected by RET-mutated sMTC. Patients were divided into three cohorts (1) 18 patients with progressive sMTC; (2) nine patients with stable disease under treatment with a multikinase inhibitor; and (3) nine patients with metastatic but stable disease without treatment. For patients in cohort 1, we studied plasma collected at the time of progression just before the initiation of systemic therapy, while in cohorts 2 and 3, we studied last plasma available at follow-up. The RET driver mutation was analyzed in ctDNA using specific digital droplet PCR assays. RESULTS: The RET driver mutation was detected in 16/36 (44.4%, CI 27.9-61.9) ctDNA samples, with a statistically significant difference among the three cohorts 16/18 (88.9%, CI 65.3-98.6) in cohort 1 and 0/9 (0%, CI 0-33.6) in cohorts 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001) with a mean variant allele frequency of 5.4%. The presence of detectable RET-mutated ctDNA was associated with disease progression (p &lt; 0.001), higher percentage of metastatic sites with &gt; five lesions (i.e., tumor burden; p = 0.001), and higher levels of serum calcitonin (Ct) (p = 0.009), and carcinoembryonic antigen (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ctDNA analysis may be a valid approach to genotype sMTC patients. Thus, liquid biopsy-based RET mutation profiling may be beneficial in advanced and progressive sMTC cases when primary tumor tissue is unavailable or inadequate for high-quality nucleic acid extraction, enabling RET-inhibitor therapy, if needed, according to specific indications. However, to obtain reliable results, ctDNA molecular profiling should be performed when tumor burden is high and the disease is progressing.</description>

This cancer-related inflammatory response is reflected by a biomarker named the systemic inflammatory response (SIRI). SIRI is calculated by multiplying the peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte counts and dividing by the lymphocyte count is a biomarker that has shown prognostic capacity in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of SIRI data for head and neck cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis using a mixed-effects model was performed to estimate the overall effect size of prognostic capacity. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival and progression-free survival, with effect sizes measured as log hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data on overall survival revealed a pooled HR of 2.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). This indicates higher SIRI patients are at greater risk of mortality relative to lower SIRI patients. Additionally, 3 studies reported metrics on progression-free survival, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (1.72, 3.13) (p &lt; 0.0001). Minimal heterogeneity was observed for progression-free survival (I2 = 0%, p&lt; 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI portends worse overall survival. Since SIRI correlates to immune function and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity, these factors are among those most likely to be impacted by altered SIRI parameters.</description>

The study aims were to analyze the incidence of CPG and to assess treatment outcomes in relation to histopathology, preoperative diagnosis and adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR), including 1,018 patients diagnosed with CPG between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence remained stable with a mean of 0.9 (range 0.65-1.08) cases per 100,000 person-years (ASR-Europe). Curative treatment was administered to 90 % of the patients, with a recurrence rate of 9 % within 3 years. The highest recurrence rates were observed in patients with salivary duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while patients with acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas had lower recurrence rates. For stage I-II tumors, the 5-year relative survival was unaffected by whether the malignant diagnosis was known preoperatively. Male sex, increasing age, stage III-IV disease, and a World Health Organization/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (WHO/ECOG) performance status 2-4 was independently associated with increased overall mortality risk, whereas the timing of adjuvant radiotherapy was not. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to establishing the incidence and treatment outcomes of CPG in Sweden and highlights the diverse histopathological diagnoses of these tumors. Notably, unknown malignancy at the time of surgery did not impact survival in early-stage disease, and the timing of postoperative radiotherapy was not associated with overall survival.</description>

This study used ICP-MS to quantify plasma concentrations of 18 metals in 368 thyroid cancer patients and matched controls, with free thyroxine (FT4) levels abstracted from medical records. Subsequently, we applied integrative statistical modeling comprising WQS regression, BKMR modeling, interaction analysis, and causal mediation analysis to elucidate exposure-response relationships and mediating pathways. Cases exhibited elevated plasma levels of Cr, Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Sn. WQS regression prioritized Sn, Cd, Ni, and As as risk-contributing metals demonstrating positive weight values, while Sb, Pb, and Zn showed inverse associations. BKMR modeling visualized exposure-response relationships, indicating elevated thyroid cancer risks at higher quantiles of co-exposure. A critical synergistic interaction was identified between the Cd-Sn pair. Causal mediation analysis confirmed FT4 mediates 46-69.3% of thyroid cancer risk for Sn, Cd, Ni, and As. Collectively, these findings highlight the need to incorporate metal mixture surveillance and FT4-based endocrine pathway screening into precision prevention frameworks.</description>

METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

To address this, we present ProteoAutoNet, a robotic experimental platform integrated with a computational workflow for high-throughput CF-MS analysis. This workflow increases the throughput of sample processing from protein complex to peptide by about two times. The integrated machine learning model incorporates targeted data augmentation to expand and diversify reliable protein interaction data, thereby improving model robustness. When applied to three thyroid cell lines, the model predicted 25,173 co-eluted proteins with an AUROC of 0.78. This analysis revealed significantly upregulated proteasome and prefoldin complexes in the lung metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC238 compared with the normal thyroid cell line Nthy-ori 3-1. Notably, we identified a protein interaction between TGM2 and HK1 that was significantly upregulated in the papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line TPC-1. ProteoAutoNet provides an improved framework for investigating protein-protein interactions and uncovering interactions.</description>

Elucidation of the metabolic alterations linked to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) could uncover potential therapeutic strategies. Using proteomics and transcriptomic profiles, we identified wild-type IDH1 as a crucial metabolic enzyme upregulated in gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy (GP)-resistant NPC. IDH1 reprogrammed nucleotide metabolism in response to chemotherapy, linking DNA damage repair (DDR) to ferroptosis resistance via DHODH, thereby contributing to chemoresistance in NPC. Mechanistically, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a metabolite of IDH1, enhanced chromatin accessibility to promote DHODH transcription via α-KG-dependent dioxygenase ALKBH5-recruited HNRNPC. The DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234 markedly sensitized NPC cells to chemotherapy. Clinically, a prognostic model based on DDR and ferroptosis signatures effectively predicted disease relapse risk post-chemotherapy in NPC. This study links DDR to ferroptosis defense via the IDH1/α-KG/ALKBH5/DHODH axis, suggesting DHODH inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in tumors harboring wild-type IDH1.</description>

Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted a secondary analysis of 181 cancer patients using NHANES data from 2007 to 2020, including 91 individuals with thyroid cancer. Generalized linear regression, logistic regression, and sensitivity analysis were used to analyze the association between thyroid cancer and ALS in three different models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and feature importance analysis were utilized to assess the clinical predictive value of thyroid cancer. We also conducted a series of mediation analyses to examine the mediating role of ALS. RESULTS: The ALS in thyroid cancer patients was higher than that in other cancer types (P &lt; 0.05). Thyroid cancer was significantly associated with ALS even after adjusting for demographic variables (β = 0.770, 95%CI: 0.315-1.480; OR=2.255, 95%CI: 1.111-4.575). This association remained robust to missing data (all P &lt; 0.05) and was not confounded by drinking, diabetes, or thyroid disease (all P &gt; 0.05). Although thyroid cancer had limited predictive value on ALS, it exerted strong explanatory power. The mediation analysis conducted with imputed data and adjusted for confounding variables revealed that ALS fully mediated the effect of thyroid cancer on red cell distribution width (RDW) (IE: β = 0.103, P = 0.008; DE: β = 0.389, P = 0.056), with a mediation proportion of 20.93%. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that thyroid cancer condition were associated with elevated AL. AL mediated the relationship between thyroid cancer and RDW.</description>

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

In the present study, we conducted cell proliferation assay and western blotting using cell lines derived from MM and the immunohistochemical analysis of pathological MM tissues to identify novel therapeutic targets. Herein, we report on the potential of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitors as molecular targeted therapies for MM. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study and laboratory analysis. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. METHODS: MTT assay and western blotting were performed on the HMV-II (RCB0777) and GAK (JCRB0180) cell lines, treated with the CDK4 inhibitors abemaciclib (LY2835219) and palbociclib (PD-0332991). This retrospective cohort study included patients with head and neck MM; immunohistochemistry was performed on clinical specimens. RESULTS: Abemaciclib and palbociclib showed concentration-dependent cytostatic effects on HMV-II and GAK cells at 72 hours in the MTT assay. In western blotting, they exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on phosphorylated RB1 in HMV-II and GAK cells at 24 hours. Of 23 patients, 18 (78.3%) had positive results on CDK4 immunostaining. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly associated with CDK4 status. CONCLUSION: Abemaciclib and palbociclib may suppress MM cell proliferation. The CDK4 signaling pathway is a potential target for molecular-targeted therapies in MM.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Win Myint TT, McIvor N, Douglas R, Cavadino A, Tin Tin S, Elwood M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570438/'&gt;41570438&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx have traditionally been associated with common risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use. With changes in smoking and drinking patterns, the incidence of these cancers is expected to change. Although the incidence of oral cavity cancer has been reported recently, there is limited evidence available for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in New Zealand (NZ). Furthermore, while growing evidence suggests increasing incidence of tongue cancer among females and young individuals, this trend has not been investigated in NZ. This study will therefore assess the incidence rates, trends in incidence, and survival of tongue, other oral cavity, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. METHODS: The study included patients with a primary diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) oral tongue, other oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx, which were retrieved from the National Cancer Registry from 2006 to 2022. Directly age-standardised incidence rates were calculated, using the World Health Organisation standard population. Time trends were analysed with joinpoint regression to identify annual percentage changes (APCs), and overall and relative survival rates were estimated. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate per 100,000 population was 1.2 for oral tongue SCC, 1.0 for other oral cavity SCC, 1.1 for laryngeal SCC, and 0.3 for hypopharyngeal SCC. Males consistently showed a higher incidence rate than females for all tumours except oral tongue SCC, where the incidence rates in older-aged females were higher than that of their male counterparts. Incidence rates differed by ethnicity, with Pasifika having higher incidence rates for oral tongue and other oral cavity SCC, and Māori for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC, compared to European. Over the past 17 years, trends in incidence rates of laryngeal SCC declined significantly with 5 % per year overall and across all sexes, age groups and ethnic groups, whereas those of oral tongue, other oral cavity and hypopharyngeal SCC remained stable. Both overall and relative survival rates were highest for oral tongue SCC and lowest for hypopharyngeal SCC. The 5-year relative survival rates were 73 % for oral tongue SCC, 58 % for other oral cavity SCC, 67 % for laryngeal SCC and 42 % for hypopharyngeal SCC. In addition to age effects, survival outcomes varied by ethnicity, with notable disparity observed among Māori for other oral cavity and laryngeal SCC. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a consistent decline in laryngeal SCC incidence rates in New Zealand over the last 17 years. However, no such decline was observed for oral tongue, other oral cavity, and hypopharyngeal SCC. The findings suggest that the risk attributed by common risk factors such as smoking may vary between tumour sites and demographic groups, particularly for oral tongue SCC.</description>

Quantitative imaging may provide scalable biomarkers to individualise care. Quantitative imaging can support baseline risk stratification, early on-treatment decision-making, and posttreatment surveillance in HPV-positive OPSCC. Real-world translation requires standardised reporting, calibration/harmonisation across centres, rigorous model validation, and workflow integration with radiotherapy planning. Quantitative MRI, CT, and PET, augmented by radiomics and AI, show convergent promise as non-invasive biomarkers to enable safe individualisation of therapy in HPV-positive OPSCC, contingent on methodological rigour and prospective, externally validated studies. Despite this promise, clinical translation faces substantial barriers, including limited external validation, heterogeneous methodologies, and the need for standardised, prospectively validated pipelines.</description>

This scoping review aims to systematically explore the existing literature on prehabilitation programs for non-surgical cancer treatments. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were systematically searched from their inception to October 2024 for peer-reviewed studies involving prehabilitation prior to non-surgical treatment. Data were extracted and reported adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, using a convergent synthesis design to present qualitative and quantitative evidence. No formal risk-of-bias or quality appraisal was conducted. Results: Of 22,122 studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, yielding a combined sample of 6073 patients and thirty-four unique interventions. Sample sizes ranged from 9 to 1992, with randomized control trials being the most common (16). Head and neck cancer was the most frequently studied, followed by breast, esophageal/gastric, and lung cancer. Of the included interventions, 23 were unimodal and 16 were multimodal. Exercise was the most common component (30), with nutrition (13), psychosocial (10), and educational (8) components also present. Most efficacy studies (84%) reported improved outcomes and nearly all (93%) feasibility studies found prehabilitation acceptable and implementable. Conclusions: This review highlights a growing body of literature examining prehabilitation prior to chemotherapy or RT in adult cancer patients, with studies suggesting potential benefits and feasibility. However, long-term trials, especially in diverse cancers and older populations, remain scarce. Our results provide insight into future implementation, evaluation of outcomes, and directions for future prehabilitation research.</description>

Dutch guidelines recommend a care pathway interval (CPI) of a maximum of 30 days, and a free bone margin of at least 5 mm. Fused MRI and CT data are used for accurate tumor delineation. Based on this data, a virtual surgical plan is created and transferred to the operating room using resection guides and patient-specific implants (PSIs). Long-term evaluation is needed to further optimize its clinical use. Objectives: This study evaluates adherence to bone margin and CPI guidelines in mandibular OSCC. Additionally, it assesses the accuracy of tumor resection and reconstruction using 3D-VSP and compares the complications of 3D-planned mandibular reconstruction using different kinds of osteosynthesis plates. Methods: All patients who underwent a segmental mandibulectomy between 2014 and 2024 at the University Medical Center Groningen were included. CPI, clinical outcomes, and complications were analyzed. The preoperative virtual plan was compared with the postoperative outcome to assess accuracy. Results: The median CPI was 34 days, and 93.7% of bone margins were tumor-free. Mean absolute resection deviation was 1.63 mm (±1.42). PSI reconstructions were significantly more accurate in intergonial distance and coronal angle compared to conventional plates. Plate-related complications were more common in non-bony reconstructions; PSI reconstructions showed significantly more plate exposure. Conclusions: 3D-VSP leads to high accuracy in resection and reconstruction and favorable bone margins. Shortening the CPI and reducing biological complications are essential to further improve oncological outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the methylation status, functional effects, and underlying mechanisms of BCAR3 in TC. METHODS: BCAR3 methylation was analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in 422 TC and 371 benign thyroid nodule samples. Expression levels were assessed via immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blot. Functional assays including proliferation, migration, and invasion were performed after BCAR3 knockdown. Rescue experiments using a PI3K activator were conducted to examine pathway mechanisms. RESULTS: BCAR3 was significantly hypomethylated in TC compared to benign tissues (p &lt; 0.001), with CpG_6 most strongly associated with TC risk (odds ratio, OR = 1.73, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, BCAR3 hypomethylation was more pronounced in cases with larger tumor size and advanced disease stage. Furthermore, BCAR3 methylation showed differential patterns across TC subtypes, with medullary thyroid carcinoma exhibiting the lowest methylation levels. BCAR3 expression was upregulated in TC tissues and cell lines (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, BCAR3 knockdown reduced phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR and altered expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, characterized by an increase in E-cadherin and decreases in Vimentin and N-cadherin, and consequently suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion (p &lt; 0.05). Rescue experiments with a PI3K activator showed a trend towards restoration of these effects, although not to the level of the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: BCAR3 hypomethylation contributes to TC cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion by promoting AKT/mTOR activation and EMT. These findings highlight the potential of BCAR3 methylation as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in TC.</description>

In thyroid surgery, patient communication can be complicated by the complex anatomy and variable surgical approaches, which may not be fully conveyed through conventional verbal explanations or schematic drawings. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) thyroid models may provide an intuitive tool to enhance patient comprehension. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at Peking Union Medical College Hospital with 94 newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer patients scheduled for thyroidectomy. Participants were assigned to either the control group (n = 47), which received preoperative drawing-based counseling, or the intervention group (n = 47), which utilized a virtual 3D model for communication. The Thyroid Navigator app, developed by Kuma Hospital, was used to provide dynamic 3D representation of the thyroid gland, surrounding structures, and potential surgical procedures. After standardized preoperative consultations, patients were surveyed to assess their understanding in pertinent anatomy and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Patients in the 3D model group demonstrated similar correct response rates in lesion localization (p = 0.536) or parathyroid gland recognition (p = 0.071), but significantly higher accuracy in identifying the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the extent of lymph node dissection compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, comprehension of the causes of major postoperative complications-including hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, p = 0.004), hypocalcemia (parathyroid gland impairment, p = 0.015), and bleeding (inadequate hemostasis, p = 0.008)-was significantly improved in the 3D model group. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a virtual 3D thyroid model significantly improves patient comprehension of thyroid anatomy, surgical procedures, and potential complications, thereby enhancing clinician-patient communication. Virtual 3D models represent a practical and cost-effective supplement to conventional counseling in thyroid surgery, offering clear benefits in patient education and shared decision-making.</description>

In this study, we compared TORT and TOETVA in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Methods: From September 2016 to January 2022, we retrospectively compared patient characteristics and clinical features from 100 TORT cases and 300 TOETVA cases, as well as their respective learning curves. Results: Median operation time of TORT was 80.4 min, similar to TOETVA (81.4 min, p = 0.719). Median docking time of TORT was 4.51 min and median console time was 27.72 min. The length of stay of TORT and TOETVA was 2.29 and 2.54 (p = 0.002). The median number of retrieved central lymph nodes for TOETVA and TORT were 2.89 and 2.99 (p = 0.746). Discussion: There was no significant difference with clinical features between TORT and TOETVA.</description>

We aim to systematically review the literature on radiomics in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, assessing applications in tumour staging, prognosis, recurrence prediction, and treatment response evaluation. PROSPERO ID: CRD420251117983. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched in May 2025. INCLUSION CRITERIA: studies published between 1 January 2010 and 31 January 2024, extracted radiomic features from CT, PET/CT, or MRI, and analysed outcomes related to diagnosis, staging, survival, recurrence, or treatment response in laryngeal cancer. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: case reports, abstracts, editorials, reviews, or conference proceedings, exclusive focus on preclinical or animal models, lack of a clear radiomics methodology, or did not include imaging-based feature extraction. Results were synthesised narratively by modelling objective, alongside formal assessment of methodological quality using the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS). Results: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria, with most using CT-based radiomics. Seven incorporated PET/CT. Radiomic models demonstrated moderate-to-high accuracy across tasks including T-staging, thyroid cartilage invasion, survival prediction, and local failure. Key predictive features included first-order entropy, skewness, and texture metrics such as size zone non-uniformity and GLCM correlation. Methodological variability, limited external validation, and small samples were frequent limitations. Conclusions: Radiomics holds strong promise as a non-invasive biomarker for laryngeal cancer. However, methodological heterogeneity identified through formal quality assessment indicates that improved standardisation, reproducibility, and multicentre validation are required before widespread clinical implementation.</description>

Tumor-associated plasma-derived small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have gained increasing attention as an important regulatory TME component for tumor progression and immune evasion. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of plasma-derived sEVs from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in the systemic regulation of hypoxia-related molecular pathways in circulating immune cells. Plasma-derived sEVs of healthy donors (HDs) and HNSCC patients were isolated and evaluated for morphology, size, miRNA cargo composition, and their influence on monocyte characteristics. Transfer of plasma-derived sEVs from HNSCC patients stimulated increased levels of checkpoint molecule PD-L1 and chemokine CXCL4 secretion. An accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α was associated with hypoxia-regulating miRNAs in sEVs from HNSCC patients. This provides new insights into a proposed tumor-associated systemic sEV-miRNA-mediated hypoxia transfer.</description>

The optic disc, as a key part of the visual conduction pathway, is an important indicator for evaluating radiation-related ocular complications. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide detailed structural information of the retina and optic disc, which is helpful for early detection of minor structural changes in the optic disc. METHODS: This study is a prospective cross-sectional study, including 60 healthy examinees and 60 patients with malignant head and neck tumors. All patients underwent OCT examinations before radiotherapy, at the end of radiotherapy, and 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy. OCT was used to measure optic disc parameters such as retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFL) and choroidal vascular index (CVI). Radiotherapy was performed using a megavoltage linear accelerator for external irradiation, following a conventional high-dose fractionation regimen. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software, with Mann-Whitney U test and t-test used to compare differences between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 120 participants were included in the study. Radiotherapy had a significant impact on macular thickness (MT) in different regions and time points. The lateral nasal macular thickness significantly thinned 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy (P&lt;0.001). The CVI significantly decreased 3 and 6 months after radiotherapy (P = 0.0642 and P = 0.0119), indicating that radiotherapy may affect choroidal microcirculation. RNFL did not show significant differences before and after radiotherapy and during follow-up, but some regions showed significant changes after radiotherapy, such as the inner nasal and inner inferior RNFL thicknesses, which were significantly different 6 months after radiotherapy (P = 0.0109 and P = 0.0187). CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy to the head and neck can lead to significant changes in the structure of the optic disc, especially in choroidal microcirculation and some retinal regions. OCT, as a non-invasive imaging technique, can detect these changes early and provide a basis for early intervention by clinicians to reduce the impact of radiation-related ocular complications on patients' visual function. Future studies should further explore the potential effects of radiotherapy on optic disc function and assess the effects of preventive and therapeutic interventions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ji S, Hao F, Zhang C, Hu C, Ren H, Huang Q, Gu J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1556226'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1556226&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41602372/'&gt;41602372&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Integrins are cell-surface receptors involved in the interaction of cells with the extracellular matrix and are essential for processes such as cell adhesion, migration, and proliferation. However, the specific mechanisms by which integrin α family (ITGA) genes contribute to tumorigenesis and progression remain to be thoroughly explored. METHODS: In this study, based on The Cancer Genome Atlas, we explored the differential expression of ITGA family genes in 33 types of tumors and normal tissues. Univariate COX regression was employed to analyze its association with the survival outcomes of pan-cancer patients. Online tools were utilized to analyze genetic changes of the genes, study the relationship with immune subtypes and evaluate immune cells, and analyze the relationship with tumor mutational burden and stemness. Additionally, immunohistochemistry experiments were conducted on Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC) tissue samples to assess the impact of ITGA3 and others on patient prognosis. RESULTS: ITGA family genes are abnormally expressed in most tumors and are significantly associated with poor prognosis. Genetic changes in these genes are mainly amplifications, and the mutation group has a poor prognosis. The differential expression of ITGA family genes is related to increased immune-related scores and immune cells. In HNSC, the high expression of ITGA3/5/6 serves as a biomarker for poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our research results indicate that ITGA family genes can serve as valuable prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for tumors.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ahn SH, Seo SH, Jung CY, Yu DH, Kim KP, Kim Y, Cho Y, Seo DH, Kim SH, Yoo JI, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256261425690'&gt;10.1177/10507256261425690&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41705866/'&gt;41705866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is associated with various systemic morbidities; however, its impact in thyroid cancer patients following thyroidectomy remains unclear. This study evaluated the risk of long-term morbidities in thyroid cancer patients who developed permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism (PO-hypoPT), compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using South Korea's nationwide claims data encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Among 217,156 thyroid cancer patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 2013 to 2020, 15,592 patients with PO-hypoPT and 27,906 matched controls with preserved parathyroid function were identified after 1:2 propensity score (PS) matching. Long-term morbidities associated with hypoPT included nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression. Hazard ratios (HRs) for these morbidities were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after large-scale PS matching. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration in both groups was approximately 5 years. Patients with PO-hypoPT had a significantly higher risk of nephrolithiasis (HR 1.17, confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.30), renal insufficiency (HR 1.75, [CI 1.50-2.03]), and MACE (HR 1.10, [CI 1.01-1.19]) compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. However, the risks of other long-term morbidities, including seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression, were not significantly different between the two groups. The association between PO-hypoPT and renal insufficiency remained consistent across all subgroups stratified by sex, age, and duration of calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: PO-hypoPT in thyroid cancer patients is associated with increased long-term morbidity, particularly renal and cardiovascular complications. Long-term monitoring of renal function and cardiovascular health is warranted in this population.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li JZ, Ricarte Filho J, Isaza AR, Hinkle K, Xu F, Li MM, Bauer AJ, Franco AT, Zhou W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701943/'&gt;41701943&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of invasiveness in pediatric thyroid carcinomas is essential to prevent unnecessary surgery and avoid surgery-associated complications. DNA methylation, a proven molecular biomarker for cancer classification, holds promise for stratifying thyroid cancer risk. The objectives were to determine the epigenetic hallmarks of pediatric thyroid carcinomas and to investigate whether DNA methylome profiling is a feasible approach for pre-operative risk stratification of this pediatric disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from two separately processed cohorts of pediatric thyroid carcinoma. The reference cohort included 100 samples, consisting of 87 well-differentiated primary tumors-77 papillary and 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas-and 13 matched lymph node metastases. To predict oncogenic drivers and tumor invasiveness, defined by the presence of nodal metastasis, we trained two classifiers on the reference cohort and then evaluated their performance on a second validation cohort of 84 samples, including 83 primary tumors and one lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We identified distinct methylation patterns associated with tumor invasiveness and key driver mutations, including BRAF p.V600E, RAS-like mutations, kinase fusions, and DICER1 mutations. The differentially methylated regions reflect inflammatory stress, disrupted thyroid development and function, implicating AR, Hippo, and AP-1 signaling. Leveraging these epigenetic signatures, we developed and validated two methylation-based classifiers that accurately predict tumor invasiveness and oncogenic mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric thyroid carcinoma patients, DNA methylation assays accurately predict tumor invasiveness and driver mutations. Our findings highlight the clinical value of DNA methylation profiling for risk stratification and classification of pediatric thyroid cancers.</description>

CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used to block the CD47/SIRPa interaction that inhibits antigen-presenting cell phagocytosis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells, and have shown promise in combination with anti-PD1 immunotherapy in tumors, including recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We found that CD47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and explored the anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD47 fusion protein in combination with anti-PD1 and lymphatic-sparing radiotherapy in a locally advanced HNSCC model. In the 4MOSC1 syngeneic HPV-negative HNSCC mouse model, ALX301 (an engineered CD47-blocking SIRPα fusion for murine models) induced complete tumor regression when combined with anti-PD-1, and produced a partial tumor response as a monotherapy. An anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in a CD47-null tumor background led to complete tumor regression confirming a key role for CD47 in tumor immunity. ALX301 treated mice demonstrated increased MHC-II expression on dendritic cells within the tumor and upregulation of CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on dendritic cells within the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes, and contralateral lymph nodes. Combination ALX301 and anti-PD1 treatment in an anti-PD1 resistant 4MOSC2 model demonstrated significant tumor regression, enhanced survivability, improved response with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and greater retention of CD8 + T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, T-cell receptor sequencing revealed increased shared clonality between the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes of ALX301 treated mice. These data demonstrate that a combination of CD47 blockade and anti-PD1 therapy enhances tumor antigen presentation and immune cell infiltration, while further improving anti-tumor responses in combination with tumor-targeted radiotherapy. This study provides support for the rational design of combinatorial immunoradiotherapy, using anti-CD47 inhibitors and anti-PD1 therapy, in a clinical trial targeting locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.</description>

In this study, we addressed the effects of areca nut extract (ANE) on oral carcinogenesis by modulating fibroblast behavior in oral tissue. METHODS: Cell viability, migration, invasion, and flow cytometry assays were applied to study cell behaviors. Cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, phospho-kinase array, Western blot analysis, and oxygen consumption and glycolysis assays were performed to evaluate cell functions. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining using human and hamster oral tissues was applied to validate in vitro findings. RESULTS: Increased alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) were observed in fibroblasts from oral precancerous and cancer lesions. ANE increased mitochondrial metabolism in fibroblasts and induced myofibroblast transition. It enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion in fibroblasts. Conditioned medium from ANE-treated fibroblasts and recombinant GM-CSF increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and malignant transformation in dysplastic oral keratinocytes. In hamsters, ANE treatment increased GM-CSF expression in fibroblasts and EGFR phosphorylation in epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: ANE promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and GM-CSF secretion in fibroblasts, which activate EGFR signaling and malignant transformation of oral precancerous cells.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cubero L, Acosta O, Pascau J, Palard-Novello X, Barateau A, Campillo-Giménez B, de Crevoisier R, Castelli J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707993/'&gt;41707993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Xerostomia is a common and debilitating toxicity following head and neck cancer (HNC) radiotherapy (RT). Although adaptive radiotherapy (ART) strategies can reduce mean parotid gland (PG) dose, clinical trials have shown limited benefit in reducing xerostomia, suggesting global dose metrics may be insufficient. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) enables assessing local dose-toxicity relationships and may identify symptom-related subregions (SRS) more predictive of toxicity. This study aimed to identify xerostomia-associated SRS using VBA and assess their relevance using a functional salivary atlas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy were randomized to receive standard RT or weekly ART. Xerostomia was assessed at 12 months post-treatment using stimulated salivary flow (SSF), with values ≤ 500 mg/min indicating xerostomia. A customized VBA was applied to identify subregions from voxel-wise dose differences between patients with and without xerostomia using a permutation test (planned dose in standard arm and accumulated dose in ART arm). To assess clinical relevance, a functional salivary atlas was generated from PSMA-PET/CT scans of 13 prostate cancer patients and compared with the subregions. A dosimetric analysis evaluated the predictive value of dose in overlapping regions. RESULTS: VBA identified a subregion (300.2 cc) with significantly higher doses in xerostomia patients, located contralaterally near the nasopharynx. Overlap with the functional PSMA-PET atlas revealed two clinically relevant subregions in the contralateral PG (SRSPG, 6.8cc) and tubarial gland (SRStubarial, 12.7 cc), with doses &gt; 11.5 Gy higher in xerostomia patients. Logistic regression models yielded high predictive performance, with maximum AUCs of 0.88 for SRSPG and 0.88 for SRStubarial. CONCLUSION: VBA revealed two predictive subregions-within the contralateral PG and tubarial glands-strongly associated with xerostomia at 12 months post-RT. Our findings offer a plausible explanation for the persistence of xerostomia despite PG sparing and support incorporating subregional dose metrics and tubarial gland sparing into RT planning.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Brauer ER, Lazaro S, Economou DR, Rapkin D, Wong DJ, St John MA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of geriatric oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102892'&gt;10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702290/'&gt;41702290&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Frailty and malnutrition are strong predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with head and neck cancer, yet remain underassessed in routine clinical care. This project aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate a standardized screening process for frailty and malnutrition in a multidisciplinary head and neck cancer program to identify high-risk patients and inform treatment planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Through a quality improvement initiative, a multidisciplinary team integrated the Risk Analysis Index for Cancer (RAI-C) for frailty and Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) into routine intake for new referrals of patients with head and neck cancer. Implementation was evaluated across three domains: feasibility, measured through completion rates, acceptability, assessed using clinician feedback via a survey, and impact on patient outcomes, using survival analysis. RESULTS: Among 585 eligible patients, 488 (83.4%) were successfully screened. The cohort (mean age 63.1 years, 64% male) demonstrated high frailty prevalence with 57.2% categorized as frail (RAI-C score ≥ 37) and 14.3% at risk for malnutrition (MST score ≥ 2). In multivariable analysis adjusted for tumor site, treatment intensity, and comorbidities, frail patients had a more than 3-fold increased mortality risk compared to non-frail patients (adjusted HR 3.07, 95% CI 1.50-6.30, p = 0.002). Similarly, malnourished patients showed a 2.8-fold increased mortality risk compared to non-malnourished patients (adjusted HR 2.77, 95% CI 1.52-5.03, p &lt; 0.001). Clinician feedback (n = 14) emphasized the value of screening in promoting "whole person" treatment planning, with suggestions for developing standardized pathways for interventions based on screening results. DISCUSSION: Implementing frailty and malnutrition screening in multidisciplinary head and neck cancer care is feasible, acceptable to clinicians, and identifies patients at significantly higher mortality risk. The strong association between screening results and survival validates these tools' clinical utility and supports their integration into routine practice. Future directions include developing a structured prehabilitation program targeted to modifiable risk factors identified through screening to potentially improve outcomes in this vulnerable population.</description>

However, the prognostic impact of the surgical extent remains inadequately characterized. This study evaluated the association between surgical approach and survival outcomes in T3b DTC. METHODS: We analyzed 6,920 T3b DTC patients (2004-2022) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (total thyroidectomy, n = 6,638; lobectomy, n = 282). Variable importance was assessed using SHAP values and permutation methods derived from Random Survival Forest models. The association between surgical approach and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Stratified survival analyses were performed by tumor size (≤20 mm, 20-40 mm, &gt;40 mm) and nodal status (N0, N1a, N1b). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using disease-specific survival as an alternative endpoint, with Fine-Gray models employed to account for competing non-thyroid cancer mortality. RESULTS: Variable importance analysis revealed that surgical approach minimally predicted outcomes (SHAP: 1.5%; permutation: 1.8%), ranking below age (43.1-55.8%), tumor size (21.2-22.2%), and nodal status (5.5-11.4%). Lobectomy showed equivalent survival to total thyroidectomy (adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68-1.37; 10-year OS 89.9% vs 89.6%, difference - 0.3%). Survival equivalence was consistent across all tumor size and nodal status subgroups, with favorable-risk patients (tumors ≤ 40 mm, N0) achieving disease-specific survival &gt; 96% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that surgical extent has minimal impact on survival in T3b DTC. Lobectomy may be an appropriate option for selected patients, supporting individualized rather than universal total thyroidectomy.</description>

Consistent and rigorous documentation is essential to evaluate this approach across disease sites. A system accounting for the complex anatomy of sinonasal tumors is currently lacking. We developed a framework to elucidate how neoadjuvant therapy impacts the extent and morbidity of surgery in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS AND RESULTS: A review of the medical literature highlighted a gap in research into response-adapted surgery for sinonasal malignancies. We developed a novel classification system to document resection at initial presentation and following neoadjuvant treatment. The framework is grounded in the surgical anatomy of the sinonasal region and weighs completeness with broad reproducibility to categorize adaptations according to (1) structures resected (2) exposure (3) reconstruction and (4) lymph node management. The surgical morbidity score was developed through a structured, iterative consensus process with a multidisciplinary expert panel. The final classification system was formally reviewed and endorsed by the institutional sinonasal tumor disease management team, establishing it as the standardized framework for documenting surgical outcomes in patients with SCC undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system introduces the first response-adapted surgery classification to encompass patients with locoregionally advanced sinonasal SCC treated with neoadjuvant therapy prior to definitive surgical resection. By extending standardized terminology, this framework enhances communication within multidisciplinary teams, enables meaningful comparisons across published studies, and supports consistency in developing clinical trial endpoints seeking to balancing oncologic control and functional preservation.</description>

This study developed and validated the Ecotype-Integrated Response Model for HNSCC (EIRM-HN), integrating single-cell states, spatial transcriptomic niches, and bulk transcriptomes to derive immune ecotypes that stratify ICI outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective multi-cohort study analysed 370 HNSCC cases (80 molecular, 210 immunotherapies, 80 control) profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing. Immune ecotypes were derived from integrated single-cell and spatial features, converted into weighted gene signatures, and projected into bulk ICI cohorts to train penalised Cox and logistic models and compare performance against PD-L1, tumour mutational burden, and published signatures, with external prognostic validation in the GSE65858 bulk cohort. RESULTS: Among 210 ICI-treated patients, four ecotypes occurred at similar frequencies. The most suppressive ecotype showed low CD8+ T-cell abundance, high regulatory T-cell abundance, and increased stromal fraction, with median progression-free survival of 3.8 months and overall survival of 9.1 months, versus 9.8 and 20.3 months in the lymphoid-enriched ecotype. EIRM-HN achieved progression-free and overall survival concordance indices of 0.71 and 0.70, improving to 0.75 and 0.74 after adding clinical covariates, and exceeding PD-L1 and TMB. In GSE65858, overall survival concordance index was 0.67 with a hazard ratio of 1.89 for high- versus low-risk strata. CONCLUSION: An ecotype-based, spatially anchored risk model integrating single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomic data provides improved prognostic stratification of HNSCC relative to established biomarkers and generalises to an external bulk cohort.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fan M, Yin Q, Li L, Lian Q, Tang Y, Yan L, Xu J, Huang Y, Wang H, Li H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702154/'&gt;41702154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Outcomes for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) remain suboptimal despite comprehensive therapy. Preclinical studies demonstrated that low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (LDFRT) could potentiate chemotherapy, warranting further investigation. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial enrolled LANPC patients with advanced nodal stage (N2-N3 with necrosis, extranodal extension, or short axis ≥ 3 cm). Eligible patients were randomized to the LDFRT or control group. All patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The LDFRT group received 50 cGy radiation twice daily for 2 days targeting positive lymph nodes during each cycle of IC. The primary endpoint was the overall (nasopharynx and lymph nodes) objective response rate (ORR) after IC, with the secondary endpoints including 2-year survival outcomes and safety. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (41 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After IC, the LDFRT group demonstrated a significantly higher overall ORR (100% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.03) and numerically higher CR rate (14.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.11). The LDFRT group achieved greater median lymph node and total tumor volume regression compared to the control group (90.1% vs 53.91%; 77.1% vs 55.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). After a median follow-up of 26.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) showed trends favored LDFRT (87.6% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.17; 90.1% vs. 77.1%, p = 0.23, respectively). Acute toxicities were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk LANPC, LDFRT with IC improved ORR and tumor volume reduction, and was associated with a potential benefit in PFS and DMFS.</description>

This study compared costs of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and END from the Medicare payer perspective. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with T1-2N0M0 OCSCC (16 SLNB and 16 END) treated at an academic institution from 2017 to 2025 were included. RESULTS: 32 patients were included: median age 62, 46.9% male, 38% had adjuvant RT. The SLNB cohort had shorter operative time and length-of-stay. Four patients had reoperations: 2 after SLNB (completion neck dissection, tumor re-resection) and 2 after END (neck hematomas). The SLNB cohort had lower costs for postoperative admission ($9567 vs. $12 920, p = 0.015). Total costs were not statistically different ($19 777 vs. $22 126, p = 0.45). On break-even analysis, SLNB with a completion ND rate ≤ 35% had lower costs than END. CONCLUSIONS: Costs of SLNB were 10.6% less than END, and remained lower with completion ND rates ≤ 35%.</description>

Furthermore, it sought to identify core and bridge symptoms and to observe their changes over time. METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted, recruiting 181 survivors newly diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were undergoing radiotherapy. Measurements were taken during weeks 1-6 of radiotherapy. Symptom assessment was conducted using the MD Anderson Symptom Assessment Scale - Head &amp; Neck Module. Symptom network analysis was performed at each time point, and centrality metrics were analyzed to explore the interrelationships among symptoms. RESULTS: Four stable symptom clusters were identified, with fatigue, feeling of being distressed, feeling sad, and difficulty swallowing/chewing as central symptoms, and feeling sad, feeling of being distressed, fatigue, and vomiting as bridge symptoms. The stability of the symptom network across the six time points was acceptable. CONCLUSION: The symptom network results are crucial for developing future targeted symptom management interventions. Future research should focus on developing precise interventions targeting core and bridge symptoms to alleviate nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors' symptom burden. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: For nasopharyngeal carcinoma survivors undergoing radiotherapy, implementing a dynamic symptom management strategy with tailored interventions for core and bridge symptoms enhances symptom management efficiency, thereby improving survivors' quality of life.</description>

METHODS: A prospective service evaluation was conducted in a UK hospital receiving ~ 5000 2WW referrals annually. Between November 2023 and March 2025, 2,556 patients underwent telephone triage. Patients scoring ≥ 2.2% on HaNC-RC-v2 remained on the 2WW pathway; those scoring &lt; 2.2% were considered for downgrade to a 6-week review following consultant review of their case. Patients referred with an investigation showing a thyroid nodule suspicious for malignancy were sent straight-to-test for ultrasound-guided biopsy. Diagnostic performance was assessed using histologically confirmed malignancy as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 2,556 triaged patients, 67 (2.6%) had cancer. At the 2.2% cut-off, 16.6% (424/2556) were downgraded, with 3 cancers later diagnosed (0.7%; 3/424). The overall negative predictive value was 99.3% with overall potential harm in 0.12% of all referrals. The straight-to-test pathway diagnosed 14 thyroid cancers (11.6%; 14/121) with shorter mean time to diagnosis (45.3 vs. 56.5 days). CONCLUSION: A nurse-led telephone triage clinic using HaNC-RC-v2 safely downgraded low-risk patients with minimal harm while maintaining a high negative predictive value. Incorporating straight-to-test improved cancer detection and expedited diagnosis. This pathway may enhance service efficiency in managing the increasing volume of suspected cancer referrals across various healthcare systems.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter development of a CADx model and external validation on independent cohorts. SETTING: Multicenter tertiary referral hospitals (Italy, India, China, Greece, and Spain). METHODS: Over 20,000 images derived from laryngoscopic examinations were retrieved. Images were annotated based on histopathology or expert consensus. A deep learning model was trained using an internal dataset and evaluated on 2 external datasets to assess generalizability. The CADx model classifies only images containing visible lesions, discriminating between LR and HR categories. Diagnostic performance was measured using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model performance was compared with physicians of varying expertise and ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The computer-aided diagnosis model achieved a similar performance across internal and external datasets in distinguishing HR from LR lesions, with accuracy/AUC of 0.90/0.89 internally, 0.85/0.85 on the Greek dataset, and 0.88/0.88 on the Spanish dataset. The model's accuracy was statistically noninferior to that of otolaryngologists and expert laryngologists, and superior to general practitioners and ChatGPT-4o. CONCLUSION: This is a large multicenter clinical validation of a CADx model for laryngeal endoscopy, demonstrating generalizability and performance comparable to clinicians in discriminating between LR and HR lesions. The model's success supports its potential role in augmenting diagnostic capabilities, especially in resource-limited settings. A prospective multicenter clinical trial is underway to assess real-world clinical implementation.</description>

DATA SOURCES: PubMed literature search. REVIEW METHODS: A search protocol was designed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) process for articles published between August 1, 2019, and August 1, 2024. Primary exclusion criteria were non-English text, abstracts, and case reports/series. Secondary inclusion criteria were articles specific to MPG diagnosis, histology, outcomes, and management, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: A total of 1614 articles were identified, and 137 articles were included in the final review. Most studies on low-grade MPG found that surgery alone was noninferior to surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy for local control. Elective neck dissection provided survival benefits for high-grade, but not low-grade, MPG. Most MPG are chemotherapy-resistant. Adjuvant chemotherapy provides limited survival benefits while significantly worsening quality of life and, thus, should be used only in select patients. Immunotherapy and targeted therapies for markers, including HER-2, TRK, and androgen receptors, have shown promising results in the treatment of advanced MPG. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Advances in the treatment of MPG have improved survival while minimizing treatment toxicity and improving quality of life. Future studies are needed to emphasize personalized oncologic treatment for patients with these rare malignancies.</description>

Yet, incidence trends for oral cavity cancers have recently diverged in the United States and several European countries (with declines for most oral cavity cancers but increases for oral tongue cancers), suggesting etiologic differences. This study quantified etiologic heterogeneity across oral cavity cancers using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. METHODS: Cox regression models were used to quantify associations (hazard ratios [HRs] and population attributable fractions [PAFs]) and etiologic heterogeneity for risk factors across oral cavity anatomic sites. RESULTS: Among 490,969 individuals (6,732,760 person-years), 765 incident oral cavity cancers occurred. There was substantial heterogeneity in the associations of smoking and alcohol within constituent oral cavity cancers (HRs for current smokers, &gt;2 drinks/day vs. never-smokers/nondrinkers: floor of mouth = 14.7; hard palate and other mouth = 8.1; oral tongue = 4.9; gum = 2.6; lip = 1.5). PAFs for smoking/alcohol varied widely, ranging from 12.0% for the lip to 56% for the floor of mouth. We observed unexpected associations of increased oral tongue cancer risk with increased consumption of vegetables: total vegetables without legumes (HR per cup equivalent/day, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27); Solanaceae (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.70); Umbelliferae (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.30-4.12); and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78). Associations for total vegetables (HR, 1.12), Solanaceae (HR, 1.26), and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.32) were remarkably similar in the PLCO trial, a prospective US cohort of ∼155,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for disaggregation of oral cavity cancer sites in etiologic studies and reappraisal of widely accepted smoking/alcohol relative risks/attributable fractions.</description>

Second-line therapies consist of additional immunotherapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors, chemotherapy, salvage surgery, or radiotherapy. Outcomes in this setting remain poorly characterized. We review the first two options for our population. The study objective was to describe non-clinical-trial/off-label immunotherapy treatments for advanced, recurrent, or refractory cSCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This single-institution retrospective case series took place at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, a high-volume academic medical oncology practice. METHODS: We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent systemic treatments for advanced cSCC. Patient demographics, clinicopathologic history, cancer data, treatments, and outcomes were abstracted. Overall response and progression-free survival by clinical judgment and overall survival rates were described. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included. Thirteen received cetuximab and 12 ipilimumab after failure of surgery and/or radiation, and of a programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) monoclonal inhibitor (primarily cemiplimab). Four patients are included in both cohorts. Durable complete responses were observed only in patients treated with ipilimumab. Otherwise, all other surviving patients had salvage surgery after some response to second line therapy. CONCLUSION: In this salvage setting, ipilimumab demonstrated a 33% response rate, including complete responses with durable survival. Cetuximab induced response in patients pretreated with cemiplimab whether they had responded or not to this immunotherapy. Most cetuximab-treated patients died within 1-2 years, unless salvaged with surgery.</description>

Data focused on European dental students and their knowledge/attitudes towards the use of AI for diagnosing OC/OPMDs are limited. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among final-year dental students from six European countries. The questionnaire assessed knowledge, attitudes, and perceived barriers regarding AI in the diagnosis of OC and OPMDs. Data were analysed using descriptive and comparative statistics to evaluate differences between countries. RESULTS: A total of 328 students participated (75% female, 25% male). Most students stated that they had not received formal training in AI (61%) and emphasised the need to incorporate such training into the dental curriculum (47%). Students from Portugal had highest overall knowledge scores, but at the same time, lowest overall attitude scores. The most commonly perceived barrier was insufficient training (87.8%). CONCLUSION: Final-year dental students demonstrate positive attitudes towards AI aiding in diagnosis of OC and OPMDs, although significant knowledge and skill gaps remain. Integrating structured AI education into dental curricula is essential to prepare future academics and clinicians for responsible and effective AI use.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Raaijmakers KTPM, Peters RHW, Beekmans M, Beerkens APM, Kaanders JHAM, Honings J, Weijs WLJ, Adema GJ, Bussink J, Ansems M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.02.209'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.02.209&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41698472/'&gt;41698472&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The majority of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) patients receives radiotherapy (RT) as part of their treatment plan. Even though RT is highly effective in HNSCC, therapeutic efficacy for advanced HNSCC is relatively low; a third of radiotherapy-treated HNSCC patients experiences locoregional relapse within 5 years after treatment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most prominent cell types in the tumor micro-environment (TME) in advanced HNSCC and play a key role in therapy resistance. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Here, we characterize the response of primary human HNSCC-derived CAFs to radiation and its consequences for CAF function and explore the targetability of radiation-induced senescent CAFs. RESULTS: Using primary human HNSCC-derived CAFs, we show that CAFs survive single-dose RT up to 68 Gy, and fractionated doses of 3×8 Gy; CAFs do not die but go into senescence after radiation. Importantly, we show that the CAF secretome is capable of enhancing both HNSCC cell proliferation and migration, and that CAFs retain these capabilities after radiation. Lastly, we demonstrate that irradiated CAFs display increased sensitivity to Navitoclax (ABT-263), a senolytic drug that selectively induces cell death in senescent cells. CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights the importance of CAFs in radiotherapy and offers rationale for exploring combinations of radiotherapy and CAF-targeting approaches in HNSCC.</description>

While anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have improved outcomes, reliable prognostic biomarkers remain limited. Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), a critical activator of innate immunity, was evaluated here for its clinical and biological relevance in MCC. We analysed TRIM25 mRNA and protein expression in 102 MCC cases and 9 MCC cell lines, respectively, and assessed associations with MCPyV status, clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with TRIM25 expression in both low and high TRIM25-expressing tumour groups. High TRIM25 expression was significantly associated with MCPyV positivity in both patient tumours (p = .004) and cell lines (p = .016), and TRIM25 and MCPyV mRNA levels correlated positively in tumours (r = 0.264, p = .013). Patients with low TRIM25 expression had a significantly poorer 5-year disease-specific survival than those with high expression (53% vs. 78%, p = .013). Notably, Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that TRIM25 serves as an independent prognostic marker, irrespective of MCPyV status. Pathway analysis revealed that low TRIM25 expression was linked to antigen presentation pathways, while high TRIM25 expression was associated with cell cycle regulation. Our findings suggest that TRIM25 serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker in MCC. Additionally, TRIM25 may play a pathogenic role in MCPyV-positive tumours, warranting further investigation to elucidate its mechanistic involvement in MCC tumourigenesis.</description>

We investigated patterns of clinical and pathological features and outcome differences attributable to standardized decision making for treatment pathways before and after establishing our multidisciplinary tumor board (MDTB) in 2007. We retrospectively analyzed data of electronic health records, the Saxon cancer registry and the clinic's tumor database (1990-2024). Statistical analysis included contingency tables, Pearson's chi-squared tests for categorical, Student's t test for numerical data, Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival plots and log-rank tests for time-dependent outcome measures. Among 200 patients, 83 were diagnosed before and 117 since 2007. Treatment modalities included surgery in 93% of cases, with 33.5% receiving adjuvant radiotherapy and 12.5% receiving adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. We observed disease progression in 50% of patients. Locoregional free survival was superior since 2007 (p = .035). Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) decreased related to earlier detection of distant metastasis (M1) linked to prevention of deaths from the index cancer in patients with M1 at diagnosis or relapse (rM1) since 2007 (p = .120). Moreover, conditional OS was not affected for patients with M1/rM1 diagnosis by numerically increased detection of distant metastasis since 2007 (p = .574). MDTB decision making at a certified cancer center is accompanied by increasing numbers of diagnosis of SGM and better locoregional control but not DMFS due to higher metastasis detection rate and treatment. Despite excellent and numerically improved disease-specific survival, 10-years OS remained similar.</description>

To date, there are no National Cancer Database (NCDB) studies evaluating the demographic and prognostic factors of ACC of the head and neck. Existing studies have only utilized single-institution cohorts, other databases, and narrowly defined populations, resulting in a fragmented view. This study aims to address this by providing an NCDB analysis of all patients with ACC in the head and neck. METHODS: Utilizing retrospective 2004-2021 NCDB data, this study analyzed several variables including patient demographics, prognostic factors, and treatment modalities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for overall survival, Cox Regression Models were utilized to assess hazard ratios (HRs), and binomial regression for surgical likelihood. RESULTS: ACC was most frequently located in the major salivary glands (45.2 %). The mean age at diagnosis was 58.75 years. Surgical intervention significantly improved survival, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.302 to 0.451 compared to no surgery. Overall, 69.8 % of patients received surgery. Factors associated with lower surgical likelihood included higher Charlson-Deyo scores, uninsured status, and older age. Tumor site influenced outcomes: surgically accessible sites such as the gums and oral cavity were associated with improved survival (HR 0.875), while less accessible sites like the nasopharynx and pharynx had worse outcomes (HR 1.868 and 1.123, respectively). CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment confers a significant survival advantage in head and neck ACC. Disparities in surgical receipt based on insurance status, comorbidities, age, and tumor location highlight the need for strategies to improve equitable access to care.</description>

Its relationship with airway morphology after free flap reconstruction in oral/oropharyngeal cancer (OOC) remains unclear. This study longitudinally explored OSA severity and airway changes in OOC patients post-reconstruction. METHODS: Twenty six male OOC patients underwent polysomnography and head/neck computed tomography scans before, 1 week after, and 6 months after free flap reconstruction. Airway volume/dimensions and OSA parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Upper airway volume, neck size, and total apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) significantly increased 1-week post-surgery. At 6 months, only the total AHI increase remained significant. Upper airway volume was found to have a positive influence on AHI. CONCLUSION: OSA worsened after free flap reconstruction with partial recovery by 6 months. Airway dimensions may play a different role in these patients than general OSA populations, warranting more aggressive OSA screening in this cohort.</description>

Building upon Zuckerman et al., this current study assessed temporal changes in HNC clinical trial enrollment in the context of changing racial/ethnic disease prevalence. METHODS: One hundred seven eligible HNC clinical trials were analyzed from 2002 to 2020. Participant demographics were categorized into five standardized racial/ethnic groups aligned with SEER database classifications. Differences in racial group enrollment rates were investigated using boxplots and scatterplots stratified by race and year, and with multiple linear regression. RESULTS: White participants were overrepresented and minority groups were consistently underrepresented: Black (-0.121, 95% CI: [-0.145, -0.095]), Hispanic (-0.174, 95% CI: [-0.199, -0.149]), Asian/Pacific Islander (-0.129, 95% CI: [-0.155, -0.105]), and American Indian/Alaska Native (-0.104, 95% CI: [-0.128, -0.079]). CONCLUSION: Collectively, this data supports the need for new approaches that facilitate equitable representation, needed to improve HNC treatment outcomes across all demographic groups.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study recruited non-metastatic NPC patients undergoing radiotherapy at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center (August 23-24, 2023). Acute toxicities, malnutrition, and QoL were assessed using the patient-reported outcome version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), modified Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (mPG-SGA), and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck 35 (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35), respectively. Exploratory factor analysis and network analysis were used to identify SCs and characterize central and bridge symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to explore factors associated with QoL. RESULTS: A total of 437 eligible patients (73.46% male; median [IQR] age, 47 [38-55]) were included. Most patients reported ≥ 5 acute toxicities (88.56%) and severe malnutrition (75.06%). Three SCs (corresponding central symptoms) were identified from 18 prevalent items of PRO-CTCAE: general SC (anxiety), head-neck SC (dysphagia), and gastrointestinal SC (nausea). Malnutrition showed high bridge connectivity across SCs. The network remained relatively stable across early and late radiotherapy phases. Among multiple variables examined, the head-neck SC showed the strongest association with poorer QoL (β = 1.805, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NPC patients experience multiple co-occurring symptoms that organize into distinct clusters associated with QoL throughout radiotherapy. Dysphagia in head-neck SC and malnutrition deserve to be priorities for early management to relieve the global network burdens.</description>

While surgery is the primary treatment, national trends in management and outcomes remain poorly defined. This study aimed to analyze incidence, survival, and treatment strategies for LC using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: Patients with LC diagnosed between 2000 and 2021 were identified from SEER. Demographic, treatment, and survival data were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze survival outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 351 patients with LC were identified, representing 0.3% of all laryngeal malignancies. Among patients with treatment data, 53.3% underwent local excision or partial laryngectomy, 27.5% underwent total laryngectomy (TL), and 19.2% received no surgery. Ten-year disease-specific survival was 84.8%. Patients undergoing partial resection demonstrated significantly improved survival compared with TL (p &lt; 0.05), although this finding is likely confounded by tumor size and stage. On multivariate analysis, advanced stage (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.68-3.97), older age (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-1.99), and TL (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.88-4.62) were associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: LC remains rare but carries favorable long-term survival. National trends demonstrate a shift toward organ-preserving surgery, with partial resections increasingly favored over TL. Prognosis is most strongly influenced by age and stage, while radiation therapy appears to play a little role. These findings support organ preservation in appropriately selected patients and highlight the need for prospective studies integrating oncologic and functional outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Turner M, Kent S, Hanley S, Murchie P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2026.103012'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2026.103012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41687363/'&gt;41687363&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Geographic inequalities in cancer outcomes are reported internationally, but little is known about associations between geography and head and neck cancer (HNC) in Scotland. We explored how travelling times to health services influences clinical characteristics, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and one-year mortality for HNC in Scotland. METHODS: We conducted a national, population-based, retrospective cohort study using linked administrative and clinical data covering all individuals diagnosed with HNC in Scotland between 2014 and 2019. We calculated and categorised their travelling times to key healthcare facilities and explored associations with key outcomes - HPV-status, stage at diagnosis, treatment received, and one-year mortality. Multivariable regression models adjusted for key confounders. RESULTS: 6692 patients were included. Patients with the longest travelling time (≥ 60 min or island) were less likely to present with advanced-stage disease (OR 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.54-0.98) and were significantly less likely to die within one year (HR 0.64, 95 % CI: 0.46-0.88). No difference was observed in proportion of HPV-positive cancers across travel time categories. There were also no significant differences in proportions receiving surgery or treated within 31 days of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The association between geography and HNC in Scotland is complex and differs from previous studies in other cancers. Patients with the longest travel time had lower risk of advanced stage at presentation and reduced one-year mortality with no apparent difference in HPV-prevalence or treatment access. In context these findings suggest that travelling time disadvantage is not uniform across cancer types and highlights the need for cancer site-specific approaches to monitoring and reducing inequalities. This large, population-based analysis provides the most comprehensive assessment of HNC and geography in Scotland to date. Findings challenge assumptions of consistent travel time disadvantage and can inform policy on equitable cancer care delivery in the pre-pandemic era.</description>

This study aimed to provide insight into practice patterns of providers who treat HPV-associated OPSCC. METHODS: A five case-vignette survey was distributed to head and neck surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists who treat head and neck cancer at NCI-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Providers were asked to recommend management. RESULTS: Eighty-three providers completed the survey (14% response rate). Head and neck surgeons had a 60% surgical recommendation rate while medical and radiation oncologists had a 58% non-surgical recommendation rate. Radiation oncologists were more likely to recommend RT and CRT, and medical oncologists were more likely to recommend CRT over surgery compared to head and neck surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: Provider specialty-specific biases influence treatment recommendations and emphasizes the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to head and neck cancer care.</description>

In particular, the NF-[Formula: see text]B-dependent arm of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) activates signaling pathways that are tightly associated with, and promote, resistance to irradiation. In addition to the SASP, another hallmark of senescence is the upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. The BH3-only mimetic ABT-263 has been shown to effectively eliminate senescent cells. In this study, we employed ABT-263 to overcome the therapy-induced resistance in HNSCC cells and uncovered a link to chemokine signaling. METHODS: The HNSCC cell lines Cal33 and UPCI:SCC040 were treated with a combination of ABT-263 and photon irradiation, followed by functional and mechanistic assays assessing viability, apoptosis, senescence, secreted proteins, clonogenic survival, and DNA repair. RESULTS: Functionally, ABT-263 induced apoptosis via impeding Bcl-xL and activating Bax. Senescence levels were reduced after irradiation. Mechanistically, we observed cell-line- and protein-specific changes in the SASP, including a striking difference in CXCR2 receptor expression. Cal33 cells exhibited strong downregulation of CXCR2 and were radiosensitized by ABT-263, as indicated by reduced viability and clonogenic survival. In contrast, CXCR2 expression was induced in UPCI:SCC040 cells following treatment; although viability was diminished, clonogenic survival remained unaffected. Notably, radiosensitization in UPCI:SCC040 cells could be achieved through concomitant inhibition of CXCR2. Furthermore, the radiosensitizing effect was not attributable to increased DNA damage, as evidenced by γH2AX/53BP1 co-localization. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a central role for CXCR2-mediated signaling in the development of radioresistance in HPV-negative HNSCC cells. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.</description>

Due to the rarity of salivary gland malignancies and more than 20 different histological types, there is a need to analyse clinicopathological risk factors of each histology separately, with emphasis on long-term outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study from a tertiary care centre conducted from 2014 to 2024 on all histologically confirmed MEC that underwent upfront surgery. RESULTS: 244 MEC [major salivary gland (MASG)-153, minor salivary gland (MISG)-91] were available for analysis. The median follow-up was 39 months. Location in MISG, higher T category and female sex were independent prognostic variables for survival on multivariate analysis (MVA) of the entire cohort. The impact of tumour location persisted following matched-pair analysis controlling for tumour stage, grade and margin status (OS: HR:5.3, 95% CI: 2.1 to 12.9; DFS: HR: 2.7, 95% CI: 1.2 to 5.8). The predominant pattern of failure for tumour located in MISG was distant metastasis, whereas in MASG, loco-regional failure was commonly encountered. In terms of tumour grade, low-grade and high-grade had the best and worst outcomes for both MASG and MISG. However, survival curves for intermediate-grade tumours clustered with low-grade tumours in MASG and with high-grade tumours in MISG. CONCLUSION: Tumour location demonstrated a pronounced impact on MEC outcomes following treatment, independent of AJCC staging and histological grade.</description>

To establish a theoretical foundation for THCA immunotherapy, we investigated the association between genetic mutations and tumor microenvironment (TME) by analyzing RNA-sequencing data and somatic mutation profiles from 571 THCA samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The ESTIMATE algorithm was first applied to calculate ImmuneScores and StromalScores. Samples were subsequently stratified into immune-high and immune-low groups, as well as stromal-high and stromal-low groups, based on median score thresholds. We then identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially mutated genes (DMGs). Significant disparities in mutation frequencies of BRAF, NRAS, and HRAS were observed both between immune stratification groups (high vs low) and stromal stratification groups (high vs low). Correlation analysis between DMGs and clinicopathological features revealed that BRAF/NRAS expression levels were associated with THCA clinical stage. CIBERSORT computational algorithm was also used to quantify the relative abundance of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs), demonstrating that 11 types of activated TICs were strongly associated with BRAF expression. Finally, we examined target DMGs expression in relation to immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs) to identify potential therapeutic targets. THCA specimens with suppressed BRAF expression demonstrated upregulated ICPs expression, indicating potential susceptibility to checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.</description>

Radiomics holds particular promise in otolaryngology given anatomic intricacies, diverse pathologies, and many commonplace imaging modalities. Radiomics applications span diagnostic classifiers, long-term prognosticators, and predictors of treatment response. The objective of this Review was to establish methodological frameworks, identify common limitations, and evaluate the current landscape of radiomics within otolaryngology. OBSERVATIONS: Radiomics applications span the breadth of otolaryngology, with most focused on neoplasms of the upper airway, larynx, sinonasal passages, and skull base. Head and neck cancer applications include classifiers of clinically occult pathologic features (such as extranodal extension or nodal metastases) that can guide treatment options. Prognostic radiomics can reliably model recurrence and survival outcomes, with hybrid clinical radiomics models achieving superior performance compared with single-modality models. Treatment prediction through approaches like dosiomics (using radiotherapy dose distributions) and δ-radiomics (sequential imaging over time) have shown potential in improving the prediction of therapeutic response, tumor recurrence, and radiotherapy toxic effects. Beyond neoplastic classifiers, a growing body of work has sought to risk stratify or predict the evolution of rhinologic and otologic inflammatory conditions (eg, chronic rhinosinusitis, middle ear disease). Recently, there have also been radiomics applications in sleep and pediatrics. Despite these broad advances, radiomics models have several pitfalls, such as variable imaging protocols, resource-intensive manual segmentation, limited cohort sizes, and a lack of external validation, all of which hinder clinical translation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this Review suggest that radiomics is a promising tool that can be integrated with clinical and pathologic data to enhance diagnosis, optimize prognostication, and personalize treatment in otolaryngology. Standardization of imaging protocols, rigorous validation in multi-institutional cohorts, and integration with clinical workflows remain critical prerequisites for clinical application. With continued refinement and integration, radiomics applications may help streamline clinical workflows and guide treatment planning.</description>

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

This burden may be reduced through surveillance of patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD). Here we describe a readily accessible pilot study evaluating a database-generating approach that captures our longstanding Cancer Active Surveillance Program (CASP). Our methods can be applied to other premalignancies and disease conditions to fuel clinically relevant research related to cancer risk, disease progression, interception, and outcomes. METHODS: Electronic medical record data from the senior author's head and neck cancer practice, which harbors a significant primary screening component, was interrogated for 35 International Classification of Disease 9 and 10 codes. These codes represent over 300 unique mucosal lesion descriptors or conditions associated with heightened risk for oral cancer. These data were subject to a proof-of-concept analysis to assess geographic and racial representation in the CASP. RESULTS: Automated extraction from the electronic medical record identified 1576 individuals with OPMDs with lower cost and higher fidelity than manual chart review. CASP patients were overrepresented relative to the state population within urban centers, with underrepresentation in more rural areas. More Black patients and fewer Asian/Pacific Islander patients were seen in CASP relative to our cancer catchment's demography. CONCLUSIONS: Automated medical record queries can identify patients in the catchment area with precancerous or other at-risk conditions for cancer. IMPACT: This information informs resource utilization to improve inclusivity of underrepresented groups and streamlines identification of potential participants for cancer prevention clinical trials.</description>

Studies in various fields of medicine have shown that DC to facilities is associated with clinical outcomes. Evidence specific to HNC surgery is limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate how DC, to either home or a facility, impacts outcomes for patients undergoing HNC surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent HNC surgery between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2023 was performed. Patients were included based on postoperative hospitalization, surgical interventions, and a minimum 30-day follow-up. The primary outcomes were 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and postoperative complication severity. RESULTS: Among 1,895 patients (mean age 63 years, 67% female), 1,554 (82%) were DC home and 341 (18%) to a facility. After adjusting for significant variables, DC site was not associated with readmission (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.40), mortality (0.6% home vs 1.5% facility, p = 0.2), or complication severity (mild OR 1.3, p = 0.11; severe OR 1.0, p = 0.92). Factors such as dependency in activities of daily living, tracheotomy presence, surgery severity and prolonged hospitalization were found to be significant covariates in the multivariable analysis for both 30-day readmissions and complication severity. Facility patients had more infections or wound dehiscence (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although DC to a facility was not significantly associated with worsened outcomes in the multivariable analysis, the findings of this study revealed clinically relevant differences in complication rates and readmission.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using routinely collected primary care data Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD from the United Kingdom. Adults aged ≥ 18 years with ≥ 1 year of prior history were included. We estimated crude and age-standardised incidence rates (IRs) and one-, five-, and ten-year survival from 2000 to 2021, stratified by age and calendar year. Findings from CPRD GOLD were compared with primary care data from CPRD Aurum (England only). RESULTS: There were 12,455 patients with a diagnosis of HNC from CPRD GOLD (69.2 % male; median age 64 years). Crude incidence in GOLD increased from 9.08 (95 % CI: 7.88-10.42) per 100,000 person-years in 2000-15.59 (14.07-17.23) in 2021, with similar trends observed in CPRD Aurum. Age-standardised incidence trends were attenuated overall but remained elevated for oropharyngeal and tongue cancers. Five-year survival improved modestly, from 53.8 % (95 % CI: 51.4-56.3 %) in 2000-2004-58.7 % (56.5-60.9 %) in 2015-2019. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence increases for HNC were attenuated after age standardisation, suggesting a contribution of demographic ageing, although elevations persisted for specific subsites. Small improvements in long term survival highlights more research is needed to improve earlier diagnosis which will lead to better patient outcomes.</description>

Current guidelines recommend TSH ≥30 mIU/L, a target that prolongs hypothyroidism and worsens quality of life, yet rests on limited evidence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between pre-RAI TSH levels and oncologic outcomes in adults with DTC prepared by THW. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing outcomes across pre-RAI TSH thresholds (&lt;30 vs. ≥30, &lt;60 vs. ≥60, and &lt;90 vs. ≥90 mIU/L) in adults with DTC prepared by THW. Primary outcomes included disease-specific mortality, recurrence, and response to therapy. Searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus (inception to March 2025) identified eligible studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the CLARITY tool and certainty of evidence using GRADE. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random-effects models. This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020158354). RESULTS: This meta-analysis included eight retrospective cohort studies comprising a total of 4651 DTC patients, predominantly women (68.5%) with a mean age of 46 years. All patients underwent THW before RAI. Across all TSH thresholds examined (&lt;30, &lt;60, and &lt;90 mIU/L), higher pre-RAI TSH levels were not associated with better treatment response, lower recurrence, or reduced mortality. Specifically, patients with higher pre-RAI TSH levels (≥30 mIU/L) did not have better oncologic outcomes compared with those with lower levels (&lt;30 mIU/L). At 2- and 3-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed in excellent (pooled RR = 0.87; confidence interval [CI] 0.68-1.11) or indeterminate (RR = 1.28; CI 0.72-2.27) response rates. Similarly, recurrence rates did not differ (RR = 1.45; CI 0.83-2.55), and no study demonstrated a difference in disease-specific mortality across follow-up periods extending up to 10 years. The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was rated very low due to risk of bias, heterogeneity, and imprecision. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence base is insufficient to support or refute the routine use of a specific TSH threshold before RAI administration. These findings question the recommendation to achieve TSH ≥30 mIU/L before RAI and highlight the need for trials to define the minimal effective level of TSH stimulation.</description>

We quantified patterns of relapse relative to flaps and summarized practice, toxicity and function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: in the retrospective XFLAP1 cohort (2018-2023), patients with HNC underwent tumor resection with flap reconstruction and postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) ± concurrent chemotherapy. Competing-risks (Fine-Gray) estimated locoregional relapse (LRR) and metastases; overall survival (OS) used Kaplan-Meier. Flaps were contoured a posteriori on planning CTs, when available. RESULTS: Of 355 patients across eight centres, free flaps were used in 239 (67%) and regional pedicled flaps in 69 (33%). The entire flap body was encompassed in the CTVs in 66% of plans; median flap-body dose was 65.3 Gy and pedicle Dmax 67.5 Gy for the delineated flaps (N = 153). Median follow-up was 32.9 months, 120/355 (34%) patients relapsed, including 68 (19%) LRR and 71 (20%) metastases. Median time to LRR was 7.35 months; only 3 (1%) of relapses arose within the flap body. Two-year cumulative incidence was 15.8% for LRR and 16.7% for metastases; two-year OS was 74.6%. On multivariable analysis, pN2-3 predicted metastases; LRR, metastases, and ECOG ≥ 1 were associated with worse OS. CONCLUSIONS: relapses in the flap-body epicentre were rare; most local failures involved the native tissue-flap junction or non-flap sites. These data support junction-focused CTVs with reduced emphasis of the flap body to limit morbidity, pending prospective validation.</description>

BNCT produces high linear energy transfer particles with micrometer-range energy deposition, enabling cell-selective irradiation confined to boron-enriched tumor cells in a geometrically targeted region by the neutron beam. This mechanism offers the potential for exceptionally high therapeutic ratios, provided two core requirements are met: sufficient differential tumor uptake of 10B and a neutron beam with appropriate energy and penetration. After early clinical attempts in the mid-20th century were hindered by inadequate boron agents and reactor-based neutron beams, recent technological breakthroughs have made BNCT clinically viable. The development of hospital-compatible accelerator neutron sources, next-generation boron delivery systems (such as receptor-targeted compounds and nanoparticles), advanced theranostic approaches (such as 18F-BPA positron emission tomography and boron-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging), and AI-driven biodistribution modeling now support personalized treatment planning and patient selection. These innovations have catalyzed modern clinical implementation, exemplified by Japan's regulatory approval of BNCT for recurrent head and neck cancer and the rapid expansion of clinical programs across Asia, Europe, and South America. Building on these foundations, BNCT has transitioned from a predominantly academic experimental modality into an increasingly commercialized and industrially supported therapeutic platform. The emergence of dedicated BNCT companies, international collaborations between accelerator manufacturers and hospitals, and pharmaceutical development pipelines for next-generation boron carriers has accelerated clinical translation. Moreover, BNCT now occupies a unique position among radiation modalities due to its hybrid nature, namely combining the biological targeting of radiopharmaceutical therapy with the external-beam controllability of radiotherapy, thereby offering new therapeutic opportunities where competitive approaches fall short. Emerging evidence suggests therapeutic promise in glioblastoma, recurrent head and neck cancers, melanoma, meningioma, lung cancer, sarcomas, and other difficult-to-treat malignancies. Looking ahead, continued innovation in compact neutron source engineering, boron nanocarriers, multimodal theranostics, microdosimetry-guided treatment planning, and combination strategies with systemic therapies such as immunotherapy will be essential for optimizing outcomes. Together, these converging developments position BNCT as a biologically targeted and potentially transformative modality in the era of precision oncology.</description>

Despite a wide range of treatment options, it remains a challenge to identify which ones are the most effective for which groups of patients. One solution is to analyse selected biomarkers. In this paper, biomarkers are divided into distinctive groups according to the molecular pathways analysed or specific molecules within the cell or in tissue fluids. The paper provides a description of these groups, including genetic and apoptosis-associated factors, factors regulating angiogenesis, cell structure regulators, immune factors in the form of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L1), hormone receptors, molecules involved in growth factor pathways, and cell cycle regulators. Representative examples are discussed for each of these groups, indicating their potential usefulness in staging, assessing tumour aggressiveness, and making a prognosis.</description>

Many studies fail to investigate the biological drivers behind survival disparities, especially sex-specific differences within racial groups. This study serves as a foundational project to begin elucidating biological differences in the tumor microenvironment between male and female African American HNSCC patients. Methods: A total of 111 patients who were diagnosed with HNSCC and identify as African American were grouped by sex. Analyses of socioeconomic status, co-morbidities, tumor characteristics, and treatment were conducted. Spatial transcriptomic analysis was performed on four randomly selected primary HNSCC tumor tissues. Results: No sex-based differences were observed in socioeconomic measures, treatments, tumor stage, follow-up, recurrence, or cause of death (all p &gt; 0.15), though females had higher median income than males (p = 0.035). Comorbidity profiles were also largely comparable between males and females. Evaluating tumor microenvironments, we found that male tumors were dominated by malignant cells and fibroblasts, with limited adaptive immune infiltration. By contrast, female tumors displayed markedly higher proportions of immune cells, including T cells and B cells. Male tumors harbored sparse T cells, largely skewed toward exhausted phenotypes while female tumors displayed abundant T cell infiltration consistent with immunologically active tumor microenvironment. Conclusions: Clinical and demographic factors showed minimal sex-based differences among African American HNSCC patients, spatial transcriptomic profiling revealed strikingly distinct immune microenvironments by sex. These findings suggest that biological, rather than simply clinical, differences may drive survival disparities. This project serves as a novel and foundational study promoting the use of spatial transcriptomics to evaluate possible survival disparities within HNSCC populations to alleviate survival disparities.</description>

Associated TGM1, PPL, and KRT proteins are involved in epithelial cell structure, adhesion, and differentiation. OBJECTIVE PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study aimed to evaluate TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 levels in tumors and matched surgical margin samples from 52 HNSCC patients and assess correlations with clinical and demographic variables using ELISA. RESULTS: No significant differences in TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 levels were found between tumor and margin samples. However, in tumor tissue, TGM1 and KRT8 levels showed a statistically significant association with T status. In margins, PPL and KRT8 levels were also associated with T status. Additionally, PPL and TGM1 levels were correlated with N status in both tumor and margin samples, respectively. A significantly higher level of PPL was observed in OSCC tumors compared to HPSCC+LSCC. TGM1 levels in tumor and margin samples were correlated in patients with concomitant diseases. Analysis of HPV and p16 status revealed differences in PPL and KRT8 levels between tumor and margin samples. Furthermore, differences in PPL, TGM1, and KRT8 levels were observed in relation to smoking and alcohol use, distinguishing regular or occasional users from abstinent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that impaired TGM1, PPL, and KRT8 signaling pathways might play a role in HNSCC, indicating their potential relevance for future diagnostic and therapeutic investigations. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings, clarify the mechanistic role of these proteins in disease progression, and assess their clinical utility.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ravara M, Sani T, D'Alonzo V, Valente M, Cinotti E, Miracco C, Colucci M, Croce V, Carbonari E, Rana R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18030454'&gt;10.3390/cancers18030454&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41681926/'&gt;41681926&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) represents the second most common form of non-melanoma skin malignancy, and, when not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy, it is a life-threatening disease. The anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody cemiplimab has transformed the outcome of advanced or metastatic cSCC, with response rates approaching 50% and sustained benefit beyond three years in clinical trials. Cemiplimab is now the first-line standard of care treatment for advanced disease. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included consecutive adult patients with locally advanced (lac) or metastatic (m) cSCC who received cemiplimab (350 mg every three weeks) at the Center for Immuno-Oncology, University Hospital of Siena, Italy, either through an Expanded Access Program or routine clinical practice. Clinical outcome and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) are reported. RESULTS: Between December 2019 and December 2023, 27 patients (24 male; median age 82 years [range 41-90]) diagnosed with lacSCC (n = 20 [74.0%]) or mcSCC (n = 7 [25.9%]) were treated with cemiplimab as first line therapy and were followed until June 2024. Head and neck were the primary tumor location for 88.8% of patients, followed by trunk (7.4%) and lower extremities (3.7%). All patients had comorbidities, including six patients (22.2%) with hematologic malignancies. With a median follow-up of 31 months (data cut-off June 2024), the ORR was 66.6% (complete response 22.2%) and the disease control rate (DCR) 77.7%. Median progression-free survival (mPFS) and overall survival (mOS) were not reached, while 2-year PFS and OS rates were 65.2% and 71%, respectively. Treatment was well-tolerated, with three (11.1%) patients experiencing grade ≥3 TRAEs, and three patients discontinuing treatment due to TRAEs. CONCLUSIONS: Our real-world experience confirms the high rate of durable objective responses, good tolerability and long treatment duration of cemiplimab in elderly and frail cSCC patients as well.</description>

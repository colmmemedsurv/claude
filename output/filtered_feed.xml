      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tucker A, Bollig CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70100'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41582733/'&gt;41582733&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify clinical variables associated with microscopic positive margins (PMs) during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) resection, and to explore the association of the receipt of adjuvant treatment with overall survival (OS) in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: 2019 Patient User File of the National Cancer Database. METHODS: Patients &gt;18 years of age with OPC were stratified based on margin status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical variables associated with PM. Survival analyses were performed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and hazard ratios (aHRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. RESULTS: In total, 4294 patients met the criteria. The PM rate was 16.6%. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa), salivary gland carcinoma, clinical T category, base of tongue primary site, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with PM. PMs were associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.40-1.99). In patients with PM, but without extranodal extension (ENE), adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) (aHR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (aCRT) (aHR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45) were associated with an improvement in OS versus surgery alone; however, OS between aRT and aCRT was similar for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCa. CONCLUSION: Histologic type, clinical T category, tumor subsite, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with TORS PM. aCRT did not confer a survival benefit over aRT in the overall cohort, or in subgroups of HPV-associated or HPV-negative SCCa patients with PM without ENE.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Retrospective nationwide database review. METHODS: Genomic data from 130 OCA samples, representing 124 adult patients, were retrieved from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project Genomics, Evidence, and Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) database (v17.0-public). Analysis focused on nonsynonymous somatic mutations identified via whole-genome, whole-exome, or targeted panel sequencing after standardized filtering. Mutation frequencies, enrichment based on gender and metastatic status (primary vs. metastatic), and patterns of co-occurrence or mutual exclusivity were statistically evaluated. RESULTS: The most frequently mutated genes were TERT (33.1%, predominantly promoter mutations), TP53 (20.0%), DAXX (16.2%), KMT2D (13.1%), NF1 (12.3%), and PTEN (10.0%). Significant gender-specific enrichment was identified, notably MST1R mutations exclusive to females (10.7%) and PRKDC mutations exclusive to males (16.7%). Mutations in PC, PCLO, MEN1, and TSC2 were significantly enriched in metastatic samples. DAXX and CDKN1A mutations exhibited significant co-occurrence, whereas TERT mutations were mutually exclusive with DAXX alterations. CONCLUSION: The genomic landscape of OCA is marked by frequent TERT promoter mutations and distinct mutational patterns associated with patient gender and tumor metastatic status. These findings highlight potential molecular subtypes, reveal pathways potentially driving metastasis (eg, involving MEN1/TSC2), and identify novel sex-specific alterations (MST1R, PRKDC), offering avenues for improved development of targeted therapeutic strategies for OCA.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gui L, Zhu H, Tang L, Zhu Y, Zhang Y, Lu H, Li W, Yao J, Ni S, Liu S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256261416838'&gt;10.1177/10507256261416838&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579120/'&gt;41579120&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is a rare and highly aggressive malignancy. Dabrafenib plus trametinib has shown efficacy in BRAFV600E-mutant ATC, but effective therapies remain limited for patients without this mutation. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus sintilimab in BRAFV600E-negative ATC. METHODS: In this phase 2 trial, patients with BRAFV600E-negative unresectable or metastatic ATC received anlotinib (12 mg orally once daily on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) plus sintilimab (200 mg intravenously on day 1). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR). This study is registered at www.chictr.org.cn, ChiCTR2200067045. RESULTS: From December 27, 2022, to June 11, 2025, 21 patients were enrolled. One (4.8%) patient achieved complete response, and nine (42.9%) patients achieved partial response. The ORR and disease control rate were 47.6% (10/21) and 85.7% (18/21), respectively. After median follow-up of 9.97 months (confidence interval [CI] 6.10 to NA), 61.9% (13/21) of patients had discontinued treatment, mainly due to disease progression (7/21, 33.3%), adverse events (AEs) (2/21, 9.5%), and other reasons (4/21, 19.0%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.63 months (CI 4.03 to NA), with eight (38.1%) patients were still on treatment. Subgroup analysis showed longer PFS in patients with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio &lt;3.06 (18.43 vs. 3.67 months; p = 0.010) and &lt;5 (14.23 vs. 2.67 months; p = 0.002). Median overall survival was not reached (CI 13.90 to NA), 15 (71.4%) patients remained alive. AEs occurred in 66.7% (14/21) of patients, including grade 3 AEs in 19.0% (4/21). The most common were aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (6/21, 28.6%) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (5/21, 23.8%). Grade 3 immune-related AEs occurred in three patients, including AST/ALT increased, diarrhea, hypertension, and hypertriglyceridemia. CONCLUSIONS: Anlotinib plus sintilimab showed favorable efficacy and manageable safety in BRAFV600E-negative unresectable or metastatic ATC, supporting further investigation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ciampi R, Casalini R, Ramone T, Mori S, Romei C, Matrone A, Prete A, Gambale C, Piaggi P, Torregrossa L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256261416836'&gt;10.1177/10507256261416836&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41578741/'&gt;41578741&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: One of the challenges in tumor molecular profiling for therapeutic decisions is the unavailability of tumor tissue or its inadequacy to provide high-quality nucleic acids. Although tissue biopsy remains the "gold-standard," analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may offer an alternative to characterize mutations necessary to initiate systemic therapy with selective inhibitors in eligible patients. This study aimed to identify cases of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (sMTC) in which plasma ctDNA analysis may be useful for RET gene testing when tumor tissue is unavailable. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study analyzing plasma from 36 patients affected by RET-mutated sMTC. Patients were divided into three cohorts (1) 18 patients with progressive sMTC; (2) nine patients with stable disease under treatment with a multikinase inhibitor; and (3) nine patients with metastatic but stable disease without treatment. For patients in cohort 1, we studied plasma collected at the time of progression just before the initiation of systemic therapy, while in cohorts 2 and 3, we studied last plasma available at follow-up. The RET driver mutation was analyzed in ctDNA using specific digital droplet PCR assays. RESULTS: The RET driver mutation was detected in 16/36 (44.4%, CI 27.9-61.9) ctDNA samples, with a statistically significant difference among the three cohorts 16/18 (88.9%, CI 65.3-98.6) in cohort 1 and 0/9 (0%, CI 0-33.6) in cohorts 2 and 3 (p &lt; 0.001) with a mean variant allele frequency of 5.4%. The presence of detectable RET-mutated ctDNA was associated with disease progression (p &lt; 0.001), higher percentage of metastatic sites with &gt; five lesions (i.e., tumor burden; p = 0.001), and higher levels of serum calcitonin (Ct) (p = 0.009), and carcinoembryonic antigen (p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that ctDNA analysis may be a valid approach to genotype sMTC patients. Thus, liquid biopsy-based RET mutation profiling may be beneficial in advanced and progressive sMTC cases when primary tumor tissue is unavailable or inadequate for high-quality nucleic acid extraction, enabling RET-inhibitor therapy, if needed, according to specific indications. However, to obtain reliable results, ctDNA molecular profiling should be performed when tumor burden is high and the disease is progressing.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Almeida ND, Schrand TV, Sullivan D, Yu H, Yao S, Ma SJ, Koempel A, Blakaj D, Repasky EA, Brackett CM, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579653/'&gt;41579653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammation and immune evasion are linked to tumor progression. This cancer-related inflammatory response is reflected by a biomarker named the systemic inflammatory response (SIRI). SIRI is calculated by multiplying the peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte counts and dividing by the lymphocyte count is a biomarker that has shown prognostic capacity in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of SIRI data for head and neck cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis using a mixed-effects model was performed to estimate the overall effect size of prognostic capacity. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival and progression-free survival, with effect sizes measured as log hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data on overall survival revealed a pooled HR of 2.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). This indicates higher SIRI patients are at greater risk of mortality relative to lower SIRI patients. Additionally, 3 studies reported metrics on progression-free survival, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (1.72, 3.13) (p &lt; 0.0001). Minimal heterogeneity was observed for progression-free survival (I2 = 0%, p&lt; 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI portends worse overall survival. Since SIRI correlates to immune function and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity, these factors are among those most likely to be impacted by altered SIRI parameters.</description>

The study aims were to analyze the incidence of CPG and to assess treatment outcomes in relation to histopathology, preoperative diagnosis and adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR), including 1,018 patients diagnosed with CPG between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence remained stable with a mean of 0.9 (range 0.65-1.08) cases per 100,000 person-years (ASR-Europe). Curative treatment was administered to 90 % of the patients, with a recurrence rate of 9 % within 3 years. The highest recurrence rates were observed in patients with salivary duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while patients with acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas had lower recurrence rates. For stage I-II tumors, the 5-year relative survival was unaffected by whether the malignant diagnosis was known preoperatively. Male sex, increasing age, stage III-IV disease, and a World Health Organization/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (WHO/ECOG) performance status 2-4 was independently associated with increased overall mortality risk, whereas the timing of adjuvant radiotherapy was not. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to establishing the incidence and treatment outcomes of CPG in Sweden and highlights the diverse histopathological diagnoses of these tumors. Notably, unknown malignancy at the time of surgery did not impact survival in early-stage disease, and the timing of postoperative radiotherapy was not associated with overall survival.</description>

This study used ICP-MS to quantify plasma concentrations of 18 metals in 368 thyroid cancer patients and matched controls, with free thyroxine (FT4) levels abstracted from medical records. Subsequently, we applied integrative statistical modeling comprising WQS regression, BKMR modeling, interaction analysis, and causal mediation analysis to elucidate exposure-response relationships and mediating pathways. Cases exhibited elevated plasma levels of Cr, Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, As, Cd, and Sn. WQS regression prioritized Sn, Cd, Ni, and As as risk-contributing metals demonstrating positive weight values, while Sb, Pb, and Zn showed inverse associations. BKMR modeling visualized exposure-response relationships, indicating elevated thyroid cancer risks at higher quantiles of co-exposure. A critical synergistic interaction was identified between the Cd-Sn pair. Causal mediation analysis confirmed FT4 mediates 46-69.3% of thyroid cancer risk for Sn, Cd, Ni, and As. Collectively, these findings highlight the need to incorporate metal mixture surveillance and FT4-based endocrine pathway screening into precision prevention frameworks.</description>

We developed a video-guided neck exercise to maintain mobility and improve quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Patients who underwent neck dissection (August 1, 2022-November 1, 2023) were randomized into groups using video-guided exercise (n = 21) or printed leaflets (n = 19). Cervical range of motion (CROM) and QOL were measured before surgery. Exercise started on postoperative day 7, and follow-up was conducted at weeks 2 and 12. RESULTS: Of the 40 participants, 36 completed the study (18/group). At week 2, both groups showed reduced CROM without between-group differences. By week 12, the video group improved in flexion and extension, whereas the leaflet group decreased (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). Other motions and QOL were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend video-guided neck exercise for patients undergoing neck dissection, with specialist-supervised training to ensure proper technique and improve clinical outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Canali L, Pace GM, Zimello C, Cerri L, Costantino A, Gaino F, Malvezzi L, Spriano G, Paderno A, Ferreli F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70180'&gt;10.1002/hed.70180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41574652/'&gt;41574652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), multifocality, and lateral neck lymph node metastasis on survival outcomes for pediatric patients with differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

To address this, we present ProteoAutoNet, a robotic experimental platform integrated with a computational workflow for high-throughput CF-MS analysis. This workflow increases the throughput of sample processing from protein complex to peptide by about two times. The integrated machine learning model incorporates targeted data augmentation to expand and diversify reliable protein interaction data, thereby improving model robustness. When applied to three thyroid cell lines, the model predicted 25,173 co-eluted proteins with an AUROC of 0.78. This analysis revealed significantly upregulated proteasome and prefoldin complexes in the lung metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC238 compared with the normal thyroid cell line Nthy-ori 3-1. Notably, we identified a protein interaction between TGM2 and HK1 that was significantly upregulated in the papillary thyroid carcinoma cell line TPC-1. ProteoAutoNet provides an improved framework for investigating protein-protein interactions and uncovering interactions.</description>

Elucidation of the metabolic alterations linked to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) could uncover potential therapeutic strategies. Using proteomics and transcriptomic profiles, we identified wild-type IDH1 as a crucial metabolic enzyme upregulated in gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy (GP)-resistant NPC. IDH1 reprogrammed nucleotide metabolism in response to chemotherapy, linking DNA damage repair (DDR) to ferroptosis resistance via DHODH, thereby contributing to chemoresistance in NPC. Mechanistically, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a metabolite of IDH1, enhanced chromatin accessibility to promote DHODH transcription via α-KG-dependent dioxygenase ALKBH5-recruited HNRNPC. The DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234 markedly sensitized NPC cells to chemotherapy. Clinically, a prognostic model based on DDR and ferroptosis signatures effectively predicted disease relapse risk post-chemotherapy in NPC. This study links DDR to ferroptosis defense via the IDH1/α-KG/ALKBH5/DHODH axis, suggesting DHODH inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in tumors harboring wild-type IDH1.</description>

Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted a secondary analysis of 181 cancer patients using NHANES data from 2007 to 2020, including 91 individuals with thyroid cancer. Generalized linear regression, logistic regression, and sensitivity analysis were used to analyze the association between thyroid cancer and ALS in three different models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and feature importance analysis were utilized to assess the clinical predictive value of thyroid cancer. We also conducted a series of mediation analyses to examine the mediating role of ALS. RESULTS: The ALS in thyroid cancer patients was higher than that in other cancer types (P &lt; 0.05). Thyroid cancer was significantly associated with ALS even after adjusting for demographic variables (β = 0.770, 95%CI: 0.315-1.480; OR=2.255, 95%CI: 1.111-4.575). This association remained robust to missing data (all P &lt; 0.05) and was not confounded by drinking, diabetes, or thyroid disease (all P &gt; 0.05). Although thyroid cancer had limited predictive value on ALS, it exerted strong explanatory power. The mediation analysis conducted with imputed data and adjusted for confounding variables revealed that ALS fully mediated the effect of thyroid cancer on red cell distribution width (RDW) (IE: β = 0.103, P = 0.008; DE: β = 0.389, P = 0.056), with a mediation proportion of 20.93%. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that thyroid cancer condition were associated with elevated AL. AL mediated the relationship between thyroid cancer and RDW.</description>

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

In the present study, we conducted cell proliferation assay and western blotting using cell lines derived from MM and the immunohistochemical analysis of pathological MM tissues to identify novel therapeutic targets. Herein, we report on the potential of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) inhibitors as molecular targeted therapies for MM. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study and laboratory analysis. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. METHODS: MTT assay and western blotting were performed on the HMV-II (RCB0777) and GAK (JCRB0180) cell lines, treated with the CDK4 inhibitors abemaciclib (LY2835219) and palbociclib (PD-0332991). This retrospective cohort study included patients with head and neck MM; immunohistochemistry was performed on clinical specimens. RESULTS: Abemaciclib and palbociclib showed concentration-dependent cytostatic effects on HMV-II and GAK cells at 72 hours in the MTT assay. In western blotting, they exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on phosphorylated RB1 in HMV-II and GAK cells at 24 hours. Of 23 patients, 18 (78.3%) had positive results on CDK4 immunostaining. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly associated with CDK4 status. CONCLUSION: Abemaciclib and palbociclib may suppress MM cell proliferation. The CDK4 signaling pathway is a potential target for molecular-targeted therapies in MM.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Win Myint TT, McIvor N, Douglas R, Cavadino A, Tin Tin S, Elwood M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570438/'&gt;41570438&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx have traditionally been associated with common risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use. With changes in smoking and drinking patterns, the incidence of these cancers is expected to change. Although the incidence of oral cavity cancer has been reported recently, there is limited evidence available for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in New Zealand (NZ). Furthermore, while growing evidence suggests increasing incidence of tongue cancer among females and young individuals, this trend has not been investigated in NZ. This study will therefore assess the incidence rates, trends in incidence, and survival of tongue, other oral cavity, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. METHODS: The study included patients with a primary diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) oral tongue, other oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx, which were retrieved from the National Cancer Registry from 2006 to 2022. Directly age-standardised incidence rates were calculated, using the World Health Organisation standard population. Time trends were analysed with joinpoint regression to identify annual percentage changes (APCs), and overall and relative survival rates were estimated. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate per 100,000 population was 1.2 for oral tongue SCC, 1.0 for other oral cavity SCC, 1.1 for laryngeal SCC, and 0.3 for hypopharyngeal SCC. Males consistently showed a higher incidence rate than females for all tumours except oral tongue SCC, where the incidence rates in older-aged females were higher than that of their male counterparts. Incidence rates differed by ethnicity, with Pasifika having higher incidence rates for oral tongue and other oral cavity SCC, and Māori for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC, compared to European. Over the past 17 years, trends in incidence rates of laryngeal SCC declined significantly with 5 % per year overall and across all sexes, age groups and ethnic groups, whereas those of oral tongue, other oral cavity and hypopharyngeal SCC remained stable. Both overall and relative survival rates were highest for oral tongue SCC and lowest for hypopharyngeal SCC. The 5-year relative survival rates were 73 % for oral tongue SCC, 58 % for other oral cavity SCC, 67 % for laryngeal SCC and 42 % for hypopharyngeal SCC. In addition to age effects, survival outcomes varied by ethnicity, with notable disparity observed among Māori for other oral cavity and laryngeal SCC. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a consistent decline in laryngeal SCC incidence rates in New Zealand over the last 17 years. However, no such decline was observed for oral tongue, other oral cavity, and hypopharyngeal SCC. The findings suggest that the risk attributed by common risk factors such as smoking may vary between tumour sites and demographic groups, particularly for oral tongue SCC.</description>

Depth of invasion (DOI) affects staging, prognosis and treatment outcome. Pre-operative Contrast Enhanced Computed tomography (CECT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are expensive and have limitations in assessing DOI.Buccal mucosa tumors not involving bone can be assessed for DOI by intraoral ultrasound (IOUS). RESEARCH QUESTION: Is IOUS reliable alternative to CECT in assessing DOI in buccal mucosa cancers? METHODS: This cross-sectional analytical study compared assessment of DOI using IOUS and CECT in buccal mucosa cancers against gold standard of histopathology in 52 patients with OSCC staged T2 or T3. Sonologist, radiologist assessing CECT and pathologist were blinded against each other's findings. DOI by above methods was compared and correlation analysis between each imaging and histopathology was done. RESULTS: Out of 52 patients, DOI was same as histopathology in 37 patients (71.2%) by IOUS and in 14 patients (26.9%) by CECT. IOUS over-estimated DOI in 11 (21.1%) patients by 1-2 mm whereas CECT over-estimated DOI in 34 patients (65.4%) by 3-5 mm. DOI was under-estimated in 4 patients (7.1%) each by IOUS and CECT. Correlation coefficient between IOUS and histopathology was 0.929 and that between CECT and histopathology was 0.874 for DOI. CONCLUSION: IOUS is reliable, easily available tool without ionizing radiation in assessing DOI in OSCC not involving bone. RESULTS: are encouraging compared to CECT, but it is operator dependent. Multi-institutional, large studies may further validate this conclusion.</description>

However, the immunological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain undefined. Here, we perform longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of paired pre-/post-TPF HPSCC specimens, mapping immune cell dynamics underlying chemoresistance. Our study identifies ZNF683+ natural killer (NK) cells as a gatekeeper of chemotherapy efficacy through integrated single-cell transcriptomics, spatial multiplex immunohistochemistry and functional validation. Moreover, pretreatment baseline enrichment of ZNF683+ NK cells predicts TPF response, while GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells function as the predominant immunologic effector to successful TPF intervention. Mechanistically, bioinformatics and in vitro coculture data reveal that ZNF683+ NK cells directly interact with CD8+ T cells, and drive an MHC-I-dependent licensing of polyfunctional GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells. Collectively, this NK-CD8+ axis provides a potential predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in patients with HPSCC.</description>

To facilitate individualized risk assessment, this study aimed to develop and internally validate a novel prediction model. We retrospectively analyzed 3723 patients with OSCC from a single center (2012-2023), with 2792 eligible patients randomly allocated to a training (n = 1954) and a validation set (n = 838). A rigorous variable selection process was employed, where predictors significant in univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model that utilized a stepwise forward and backward elimination procedure to identify the final set of predictors. Six factors were ultimately incorporated into the nomogram: clinical T stage, clinical N stage, histological grade, perineural invasion, time from onset to treatment, and alcohol consumption. The model demonstrated good discrimination in both training (AUC = 0.780) and validation (AUC = 0.744), excellent calibration, and clinical utility. In conclusion, this internally validated nomogram accurately predicts CLNM risk and can aid in tailoring neck management, pending external validation.</description>

Though it has been associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis, increasing CIN above a maximally tolerated threshold leads to cell death because of loss of essential chromosomes. Because radiation causes CIN, we hypothesize that pre-existing CIN sensitizes tumor cells to radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We induced mitotic defects that lead to CIN in FaDu (head and neck cancer, HNC) and HeLa (cervical) cells by knocking down or overexpressing the mitotic checkpoint protein mitotic arrest deficient 1 (Mad1), which induces lagging chromosomes. Radiation sensitivity was tested with clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts in vivo. MTT assays were used to determine the sensitivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV-negative HNC cells to docetaxel, and mitotic defects were quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy. Docetaxel-induced mitotic errors and tumor growth delay were evaluated in vivo. Six-chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantify CIN in a cohort of patients with laryngeal cancer treated with definitive radiation. RESULTS: Here, we show in two tissue contexts using engineered isogenic cancer cell lines that higher rates of chromosome missegregation sensitize to ionizing radiation, which itself induces mitotic errors. Consistent with this result, higher rates of anaphase defects in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNC patient-derived xenograft tumors correlate with response to radiation. Moreover, laryngeal tumors with higher CIN before treatment tend to have an improved response to radiation therapy in the clinic. Furthermore, we show that docetaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug commonly used in combination with radiation, causes cell death and radiosensitizes cells by inducing abnormal multipolar spindles rather than causing mitotic arrest. CONCLUSIONS: These results mechanistically implicate CIN as an inducer of radiation response and provide evidence that increasing the rate of CIN is a rational method to enhance radiation sensitivity, which has significant implications for personalized therapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lovett JT, Wotman MT, Westra WH, Ahn S, Gupta V, Bakst RL, Roof S, Miles BA, Genden E, Misiukiewicz K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564691/'&gt;41564691&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The rising incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) underscores the need for treatment strategies that maintain disease control while minimizing long-term toxicity. This study reports the long-term follow-up of de-escalation in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, providing critical data for future studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced HPV-OPC treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by reduced-dose chemoradiation (rdCRT). We hypothesized that de-escalated radiation therapy after IC would be non-inferior to standard-dose CRT (sdCRT). DESIGN: Two sequential clinical trials; Quarterback (QB) 1: phase III randomized control trial, QB 2: phase II non-randomized trial; patient accrual conducted between December 2012 and February 2022; final data cutoff April 2025. Median follow-up (IQR): 88.5 (64.6-118.2) months. SETTING: Single-institution academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients with HPV-OPC were screened. 47 patients received rdCRT after IC and were included in the primary analysis. Key eligibility: smoking history ≤20 pack-years, no active smoking, no distant metastases, molecularly confirmed HPV status. INTERVENTIONS: Three cycles of induction TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) followed by rdCRT (5600 cGy) with weekly carboplatin in clinical responders; non-responders in both QB trials and responders in the control arm of QB1 received sdCRT (7000 cGy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoints: 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary: overall survival (OS). Tertiary: disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Among 47 patients treated with rdCRT after IC, the 3-year and 5-year LRRFS were 89.3% and 86.6%. PFS was 87.2% and 84.6% at 3 and 5 years. OS was 91.5% and 89.1% at 3 and 5 years. Six patients (13%) experienced locoregional failure, and two (4%) developed distant metastases. 7/8 treatment failures (87.5%) occurred in patients with extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rdCRT following IC yields durable disease control in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, with outcomes comparable to historical benchmarks. Extended follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of this de-escalation strategy, even in patients with aggressive disease characteristics, but also underscores the need for careful patient selection, particularly in those with extracapsular extension.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study aims to construct and validate an interpretable predictive model for LN-prRLN metastasis in cN0 PTC using machine learning (ML) method. Data were collected from hospital A and divided into training and testing sets (7:3). Additional data from the hospital B were used as validation set. Nine ML models, including XGBoost, were developed. Predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), calibration curves, and precision-recall curves. The best model was compared to a traditional logistic regression-based nomogram using learning curves and the method of Probability-based Ranking Model Approach (PMRA). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the top ten predictive features and create a web-based calculator. RESULTS: A total of 2033 patients were included. XGBoost outperformed other models with AUCs of 0.859, and 0.885 for the testing, and validation sets, respectively, compared to the nomogram (0.814, 0.836). SHAP-based visualizations identified the top ten predictive features: ipsilateral paratracheal lymph node metastasis rate, number of total central lymph node metastases, total central lymph node metastasis rate, number of ipsilateral paratracheal lymph node metastases, pretracheal lymph node metastasis rate, ipsilateral paratracheal lymph node metastasis, unclear tumor border, size, and age ≤39 years. These features were used to develop a web-based calculator. CONCLUSION: ML is a reliable tool for predicting LN-prRLN metastasis in cN0 PTC patients. The SHAP method provides insights into the XGBoost model, and the resultant web-based calculator is a clinically useful tool to assist in the surgical planning for LN-prRLN dissection.</description>

Often mediated by loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1, this activation causes increased NRF2 transcriptional activity and constitutive activation of the antioxidant response. While KEAP1 mutations have been well documented in various cancers, their presence and role in thyroid carcinoma have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we sequenced pediatric thyroid tumors and analyzed publicly available datasets, identifying 81 KEAP1 mutations in tumors across a range of histologies. In these tumors, we further identified frequent biallelic loss of KEAP1 via 19p13.2 loss of heterozygosity (LOH). MAPK-activating alterations were found in a subset of KEAP1-mutant cases, but they were mutually exclusive with 19p13.2 LOH. Transcriptome analysis also revealed significant activation of the NRF2 pathway in KEAP1-mutant tumors. Four additional cases with similar transcriptional profiles but lacking mutational data were identified, likely representing putative KEAP1 mutants. Using in vitro cell line models, we then profiled the functional consequences of KEAP1 knockout in cells with and without known driver alterations. In these models, we show that KEAP1 loss leads to an NRF2-dependent upregulation of AKR1C3, GCLC, NQO1, and TXNRD1, along with increased proliferation and migration irrespective of MAPK mutational status. We also demonstrate that loss of KEAP1 reduces sensitivity of RET fusion-positive cells to selpercatinib, consistent with previous reports that these alterations promote drug resistance in other malignancies. In this study, we comprehensively profile KEAP1 mutations in thyroid tumors, showing that they are more prevalent and functionally significant than previously recognized. These findings position KEAP1 mutations as novel oncogenic variants in thyroid cancer and support the integration of KEAP1/NRF2 pathway profiling into future studies and clinical frameworks.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lin Q, Zhang Y, Sun J, Hui X, Ren Y, Song Z, Wu Z, Cai B, Feng L, Zhang H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1709974'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1709974&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41568389/'&gt;41568389&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Advanced base-of-tongue squamous cell carcinoma (BOT-SCC) has conventionally been regarded as unsuitable for transoral resection owing to its propensity for deep invasion and the difficulty in obtaining adequate surgical margins. We evaluated whether neoadjuvant therapy could enable transoral robotic surgery (TORS) in a subset of patients with advanced BOT-SCC. METHODS: In this retrospective analysis, nine consecutive patients with stage ≥T4N2bM0 BOT-SCC received three cycles of neoadjuvant therapy based on pembrolizumab, followed by TORS with concurrent neck dissection. Radiologic response and tumor shrinkage were assessed after neoadjuvant therapy. Perioperative outcomes, correlations between radiologic shrinkage and operative metrics, postoperative complications (Clavien -Dindo), and 3-month functional outcomes (MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory [MDADI], Functional Oral Intake Scale [FOIS], and Grade, Roughness, Breathiness, Asthenia, Strain [GRBAS]) were recorded. Follow-up was conducted for oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Post-neoadjuvant radiologic evaluation demonstrated clinically meaningful downstaging, with partial response in 6/9 patients (66.7%) and stable disease in 3/9 patients (33.3%). Mean tumor reduction was 35.6% ± 11.2% (median, 36%; interquartile range [IQR], 28 -44). All patients achieved R0 resection. Mean operative time was 193.3 ± 46.9 min (median, 180; IQR, 165 -240), and mean intraoperative blood loss was 78.3 ± 25.4 mL (median, 70; IQR, 60 -100). Tumor shrinkage was inversely correlated with operative time (r = -0.962; 95% CI: -0.992 to -0.825; p &lt; 0.001) and blood loss (r = -0.851; 95% CI: -0.968 to -0.430; p = 0.004), while operative time was positively correlated with blood loss (r = 0.864; 95% CI: 0.469 to 0.971; p = 0.003). No Clavien -Dindo grade ≥III complications or postoperative hemorrhage occurred. At 3 months, functional outcomes were favorable (mean MDADI 75.6 ± 10.2; FOIS ≥6 in 55.6%; median GRBAS 1.1). Over a median follow-up of 12 months, no local recurrences or distant metastases were documented. DISCUSSION: Neoadjuvant therapy may render a subset of patients with advanced BOT-SCC eligible for TORS, enabling oncologically radical resection with low perioperative morbidity and promising early functional recovery. Prospective studies are warranted to validate patient selection criteria and to develop biomarker-guided de-intensification strategies.</description>

We assessed global, regional, and national trends in NPC burden from 1990 to 2021 and projected estimates to 2050. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study for 204 countries and territories across 21 regions. Age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized death rate (ASDR), and age-standardized disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) rate were estimated, and temporal trends were assessed using estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) by socio-demographic index (SDI), sex, and age group. Future burden from 2022 to 2050 was projected using a Bayesian age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: In 2021, there were 118,878 incident cases, 75,359 deaths, and 2,490,191 DALYs due to NPC globally. The global ASIR was 1.38 per 100,000 population (EAPC -1.06), the ASDR was 0.87 (EAPC -2.17), and the age-standardized DALYs rate was 28.91 (EAPC -2.29). Incidence rate peaked at ages 65-69 years (4.23 per 100,000 population), with consistently higher rates in males than in females. East Asia had the highest regional ASIR, and Japan bore the highest age-specific disease burden. Projections indicate continued declines in apparent ASDR and DALYs rates globally to 2050, but rising ASIR in males, particularly in East Asia and high-middle SDI regions. CONCLUSIONS: Over the past three decades, global mortality and disability burden from NPC have decreased, whereas incidence has increased in selected populations. The projected rise in ASIR among males in high-risk regions highlights the need for targeted interventions, equitable resource allocation, and sustained surveillance to mitigate future burden.</description>

Preoperative differentiation among follicular thyroid adenoma (FA), follicular tumor of uncertain malignant potential (FT-UMP), and FTC remains challenging using conventional ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration. This study aims to develop a machine learning model utilizing ultrasound radiomic features to improve risk stratification of follicular thyroid tumors. METHODS: A total of 277 patients with histopathologically confirmed follicular tumors (163 FA, 63 FT-UMP, 51 FTC) were included. Clinical and ultrasound features, along with radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral regions, were extracted from preoperative ultrasound images. Three machine learning models-logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF)-were trained to construct four models: clinical-ultrasound (U), clinical-ultrasound with intratumoral radiomics (UI), clinical-ultrasound with peritumoral radiomics (UP), and clinical-ultrasound with combined intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics (UIP). RESULTS: The RF-based clinical-ultrasound model demonstrated the highest accuracy (test: 0.643) but exhibited significant overfitting in radiomics-based models. The SVM model showed moderate performance. The LR model in the UP and UIP models delivered stable performance, achieving the highest test accuracy of 0.643. Specifically, the UP model showed improved micro-AUC, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and F1 score. The LR model exhibited high sensitivity but low specificity for benign nodules, and high specificity but low sensitivity for malignant nodules. All models performed poorly in identifying FT-UMP nodules. CONCLUSION: Integrating peritumoral radiomic features with clinical-ultrasound features using logistic regression enhances the differentiation between benign and malignant follicular thyroid tumors.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Swain B, Si CD, Habib DRS, Jin W, Duvall P, Sinard RJ, Mannion K, Rohde SL, Langerman AJ, Rosenthal EL, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; American journal of otolaryngology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2025.104780'&gt;10.1016/j.amjoto.2025.104780&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564620/'&gt;41564620&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Dysphagia is a common and challenging long-term sequela following total laryngectomy (TL) that can negatively impact patient quality of life. Following TL, many patients require repeat esophageal dilations to maintain swallowing function. This study aimed to identify surgical and non-surgical risk factors associated with dysphagia following TL, defined as clinically diagnosed postoperative dysphagia based on patient-reported symptoms and dysphagia requiring dilation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective single-institution cohort study of patients who underwent total laryngectomy from 1999 to 2024. Outcomes included clinically diagnosed dysphagia and dysphagia requiring esophageal dilations, with covariates including age, BMI, preoperative PEG tube, cricomyotomy, flap reconstruction type, pharyngectomy, glossectomy, base of tongue resection, postoperative complication, neoadjuvant radiation, and adjuvant radiation. Associations between dysphagia and covariates were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 787 patients underwent total laryngectomy. Median follow-up was 28.5 months (Interquartile range [IQR]: 10.3-68.2 months). During the follow-up period, 212 patients (26.9 %) reported dysphagia, and 131 patients underwent dilation (16.6 %). Prior radiation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.51, 95 % CI: 1.56-4.05, p &lt; 0.001), adjuvant radiation (aOR: 1.86; 95 % CI 1.10 to 3.17; p = 0.021), and tongue base resection (aOR: 2.14, 95 % CI: 1.24-3.70, p = 0.006) were independently associated with postoperative clinical dysphagia. Total pharyngectomy (odds ratio [OR]: 1.83, 95 % CI 1.17-2.83, p = 0.008) was associated with dysphagia on univariable analysis. Pedicled reconstruction (OR: 1.38, 95 % CI 1.00-1.90, p = 0.053) showed a trend towards increased odds of clinical dysphagia. Only prior radiation was independently associated with dysphagia requiring esophageal dilation (aOR: 2.92, 95 % CI: 1.62-5.26, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is common following total laryngectomy. Prior radiation, adjuvant radiation, total pharyngectomy, tongue base resection, and pedicled reconstruction were factors influencing swallowing outcomes following TL. Salvage TL patients should be counseled on the possible need for post-laryngectomy esophageal dilations.</description>

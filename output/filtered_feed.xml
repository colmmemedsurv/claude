      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ouyang YF, Liang JL, Xie RQ, Liu YP, You R, Xia TL, Chen MY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70357'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70357&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41631491/'&gt;41631491&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains a major challenge due to the high incidence of recurrence, often leading to therapeutic failure. Early detection of recurrence is critical, yet effective surveillance methods are limited. This study aims to evaluate the utility of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples for identifying recurrent NPC. A total of 187 NPC patients who had undergone radical radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy were included. EBV DNA levels in both nasopharyngeal brush and plasma samples were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR. Head and neck MRI, sinus endoscopy examination, and biopsy of suspicious lesions were used as the gold standard to confirm recurrence. Patients without recurrence after more than 1 year of follow-up served as controls. Nasopharyngeal brush EBV DNA detection demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity (95.7%) for detecting recurrence compared to plasma EBV DNA testing (61.4%), with comparable specificity (94.0% vs. 96.6%). The positive predictive value was similar between methods, whereas the negative predictive value was markedly higher for the nasopharyngeal brush group (97.3% vs. 80.7%). These findings suggest that EBV DNA detection in nasopharyngeal brush samples is a highly sensitive and minimally invasive supplementary tool for monitoring NPC recurrence. This approach offers superior sensitivity and an improved negative predictive value compared to plasma EBV DNA testing, and may enhance early surveillance and clinical management of NPC recurrence.</description>

The management of non-metastatic, locoregionally recurrent or second primary cancers is a complex multidisciplinary challenge that often occurs without guidance from robust clinical trials. In 2023, the NRG Oncology cooperative group created the Recurrent and Metastatic Working Group with the express directive to investigate how resources could optimally address the key questions for the recurrent and metastatic populations. Here, we present our view of the state of the science and present considerations for future investigations.</description>

While the incorporation of immune checkpoint inhibitors has led the way to a new era of treatment possibilities, the current state-of-the-science calls for further innovation and a nuanced approach to clinical trial design to address a number of unmet needs. This white paper from the NRG Oncology Recurrent/Metastatic Head and Neck Working Group aims to critically identify gaps in clinical practice and the scientific literature and to propose actionable recommendations for future research in the framework of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.</description>

This approach is associated with early adverse effects, notably oral mucositis (OM). The C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) is a promising novel biomarker used to assess the severity of inflammatory responses in various chronic conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of pretreatment CAR for the occurrence and severity of OM of varying grades during RT in patients with LC. METHODS: The pretreatment CAR values were calculated in 68 patients treated with RT due to locally advanced or advanced LC. RESULTS: The increased incidence of severe grade OM in LC patients between weeks III and VII of RT was significantly associated with higher CAR values. A high CAR was significantly correlated with an increased risk of grade 3 OM at the end of the IIIrd (p = 0.026), IVth (p = 0.018), Vth (p = 0.027), VIth (p = 0.018), and VIIth (p = 0.004) week of RT. Multivariable analysis demonstrates a higher probability of developing severe OM in LC patients with an elevated median CAR following IIIrd (p = 0.025), IVth (p = 0.025), Vth (p = 0.025), VIth (p = 0.020), and VIIth (p = 0.035) cycle of irradiation. Furthermore, CAR values allowed reliable differentiation of patients who developed grade 3 OM between the IIIrd-VIIth weeks of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment CAR value indicates clinical utility in predicting the likelihood of severe OM induced by RT-based therapy in patients with LC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the framework proposed, the histopathological images are subjected to a preprocessing technique, and then, the images are fed directly to the NASNet-Large model for the extraction of high-level discriminative texture features. The resultant vectors obtained from the features extracted act as input to the search space of Archimedes Optimization Algorithm that carries out dimensionality reduction and optimal hyperparameter tuning simultaneously. The optimized feature subset is fed to the final classifier, namely the Stacked Sparse Denoising Autoencoder that learns robust latent representations. RESULTS: The findings demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 95.38%, a precision of 95.15%, a sensitivity of 91.78%, a specificity of 91.85%, and an F1-score of 93.72%. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the potential of the SSDA-AOA framework as an effective tool for the early detection and precise classification of oral cancer, paving the way for improved patient outcomes through timely intervention. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This innovative approach may significantly enhance patient outcomes by facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment, addressing the urgent need for more reliable diagnostic tools in oncology.</description>

This study aimed to compare the impact of perioperative intermittent pneumatic compression stockings (IPCS) and medical thrombosis prophylactic stockings (MTPS) on thromboembolic incidence. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included 98 patients who underwent total laryngectomy between March 2018 and March 2024. Patient records and an electronic database were reviewed for thromboembolic events. From March 2021 onward, IPCS replaced MTPS, enabling a before-after comparison. To assess the effect of IPCS on PE, an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression model was used, accounting for comorbidities and perioperative risk factors. RESULTS: In our cohort, 13 patients (13%) developed pulmonary embolism (PE). A history of thromboembolic events significantly increased PE risk (OR 17.8, p = 0.015). Postoperative bleeding occurred in 5.1% of patients and was associated with a higher PE incidence. IPCS use significantly reduced PE risk (adjusted OR 0.0508, unadjusted OR 0.1080) in the IPTW model. CONCLUSIONS: IPCS significantly reduced PE risk compared to MTPS, indicating definite prophylactic benefits. Patients with a history of thromboembolic events are at higher risk for PE after laryngectomy, which also increases the risk of postoperative bleeding and reoperation due to the required anticoagulation.</description>

Surgical drains have traditionally been used to mitigate these risks, but their necessity is increasingly debated due to concerns over pain, infection, and prolonged hospitalisation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of using surgical drains following thyroidectomy. This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials aimed to compare postoperative surgical outcomes in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery, managed with or without drains. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, EMCARE, and CINAHL) were systematically searched in August 2025 for articles published between January 1995 and August 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes in patients undergoing thyroidectomy with and without drains were included. Of the initial 119 articles identified, 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis, representing 1,078 patients. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pooled proportions were calculated and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method. The random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was then conducted using inverse variance weighting, with between-study variance (τ2) estimated via the DerSimonian and Laird method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included haematoma and seroma rates; secondary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI), return-to-theatre (RTT), postoperative pain, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Pooled complication rates were: haematoma 1.6%, seroma 3.7%, SSI 2.5%, and RTT 0.2%. Drain use was not associated with significant differences in haematoma (p = 0.15), seroma (p = 0.64), or RTT (p = 0.22). However, SSI (4.2% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.01), LOS (mean difference [MD] = 1.2 days; p &lt; 0.0001), and pain (MD = 2.2; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the drain group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Routine placement of drains after all types of thyroidectomies does not significantly decrease the rates of haematoma, seroma, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and is linked to higher rates of surgical site infection, pain, and length of stay. A selective, patient-specific approach to drain use is recommended.</description>

Surprisingly, there is no consistent, standardised global approach to evaluating the dosimetry of this prescription across different centres treating head and neck cancer (HNC). This study aimed to quantify global dose variations for identical prescriptions across international centres treating oropharyngeal cancer, to establish the foundation for future outcome-based studies and improve consistency of interpretation worldwide. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included patients with oropharyngeal cancer who were consecutively treated from 2017 onwards with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) at eight globally recognised radiotherapy departments. These centres were categorised into four categories: North American, North European, Oceanic, and Asian. RESULTS: The study included 1,514 patients from eight centres and revealed 40 different dose prescriptions, ranging from 55 Gy in 20 to 70 Gy in 35 fractions. When normalised to a 70 Gy prescription, the mean CTV dose showed a 4% median difference across centres. European and Oceania centres deviated by 0.4%, while North American and Asian centres had 2% variability. Near-minimum CTV doses (D98%) ranged from 68.7 Gy to 71.4 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: The study underscores the wide-ranging implementation of dose prescriptions in HNC. The lack of a standardised global approach to HNC treatment dose prescription carries potential implications for patient care, collaborative research, and treatment de-escalation or radiotherapy dose-painting strategies. This study highlights the need for careful interpretation of dose prescription standards across international centres, to analyse radiotherapy outcomes more accurately in light of their varied implementation.</description>

Due to high survival rates, maintaining quality of life-especially swallowing function-is an important long-term consideration. This study aimed to assess swallowing outcomes five years and beyond following TORS in patients with primary OPSCC. METHODS: "Functional outcome swallowing scale" (FOSS) was used to retrospectively assess long-term dysphagia in 47 OPSCC patients, with a median follow-up of 6.8 years. All patients had a minimum follow-up of five years. RESULTS: The FOSS scores remained stable at five years compared to 1-4 years post-TORS (all p &gt; 0.99). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in FOSS from 1 to 10 years post-TORS compared to preoperative score. Adjuvant therapy was a univariate predictor of worse swallowing outcomes (OR: 17.46, 95% CrI: 2.94-121.51); however, this effect was limited to the short-term postoperative period (≤ 2 years after TORS). In contrast, subsequent major surgery after TORS and treatment of more advanced tumors (pT2-pT3 vs. pTis-pT1) were associated with persistently worse swallowing outcomes, including long-term follow-up (OR: 23.81, 95% CrI: 4.48-142.59; OR: 15.03, 95% CrI: 3.06-81.45, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: TORS offers excellent and stable long-term swallowing outcomes when used as a single-modality treatment for OPSCC. While outcomes remain satisfactory with additional therapies, swallowing results are influenced by tumor stage, adjuvant treatment, and further major surgery.</description>

Increasing evidence highlights that the tumour microenvironment (TME) plays a central role in disease progression and therapeutic response. Distinct immune and stromal profiles have been observed between HPV positive (HPV+) and HPV negative (HPV-) HNSCC, underpinning their differing natural history and responses to immunotherapy. Despite advances, only 15-20% of patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC (RMHNSCC) respond to immunotherapy, with no difference in response being seen between HPV+ and HPV- disease. This may reflect the complexity and heterogeneity of the TME. This review explores how emerging spatial omics technologies, combining molecular, and spatial context, are reshaping our understanding of the HNSCC microenvironment, with emphasis on recurrent and/or metastatic disease. By delineating the spatial organisation of immune, stromal, and metabolic features, these approaches provide new insights into mechanisms of treatment resistance, prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Understanding spatial TME dynamics across HPV-related subtypes may ultimately guide more precise and effective treatment strategies for HNSCC.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: National Cancer Database (NCDB), 2004 to 2022. METHODS: Adult patients younger than 50 years diagnosed with OCSCC in the NCDB. Annual case distributions by subsite, sex, and stage were modeled with logistic regression, reporting odds ratios (ORs) per calendar year over time. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards analyses assessed 5-year overall survival (OS), stratified by age group, subsite, and stage. RESULTS: Among 178,140 OCSCC cases, 21,630 (12.1%) were EO-OCSCC with median age of 44 years. Tongue was the most common subsite (66.9%) and increased over time (OR/year = 1.03; 95% CI, 1.02-1.04). Female cases rose steadily (OR/year = 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02), narrowing the male-female gap. Advanced-stage disease increased by 5% annually in tongue tumors and 3% in non-tongue tumors. Five-year OS was higher in tongue (73.7%) than non-tongue tumors (61.5%, P &lt; .001) and improved over time, with annual reductions in mortality risk of 1.1% for tongue and 1.9% for non-tongue tumors. By age group, survival was highest for patients 20-29 years and lowest for those 40-49 years. CONCLUSION: EO-OCSCC is increasingly presenting as tongue primaries and in female patients, with a rising burden of advanced-stage disease. Despite this unfavorable shift, survival has improved modestly across subsites, ages, and stages, underscoring the heterogeneity of EO-OCSCC and the need for earlier detection and awareness.</description>

Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), a potent antioxidant, is hypothesized to enhance salivary secretion and promote the regeneration of acinar cells. Our study aimed to evaluate the effect of ALA on unstimulated salivary flow rate in patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial included 20 patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group (receiving 1200 mg/day ALA) or to the control group (receiving placebo) for three months. Unstimulated whole salivary flow rate (mL/min) was measured using the spitting method at baseline (pre-radiotherapy) and at weeks 2, 6, 8, and 12 post-radiotherapy. Xerostomia severity was assessed using the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), alongside clinical signs of hyposalivation (e.g., frothy saliva, mucosal adherence). Data were analyzed using t-tests and Fisher's exact test in SPSS version 25.00, with a significance level of 0.05. RESULTS: Although both groups indicated a decline in salivary flow over time, no significant intergroup differences were observed at any follow-up point (P &gt; 0.05). Within the ALA group, pairwise comparisons revealed a significant reduction in salivary flow from baseline to weeks 6, 8, and 12 (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, and P = 0.003, respectively). Additionally, a significant reduction was observed between weeks 2 and 6 (P = 0.011). No significant differences between groups were found in NRS scores or clinical indicators of hyposalivation during any follow-up session (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of 1200 mg/day ALA may temporarily delay the onset of salivary gland dysfunction in the early phases of radiotherapy. However, this effect was not statistically significant and may not have a sustained clinical benefit. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This clinical trial was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (IR.SBMU.DRC.REC.1401.062) and registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT20221219056864N1, registered on December 19, 2022).</description>

Large language models (LLMs) may support guideline-based decision-making, although performance in complex oncologic scenarios is not well defined. METHODS: Fourteen synthetic cases based on real tumor board encounters were evaluated. Five blinded comparator arms produced recommendations: a human expert, Non-RAG-GPT-4, Non-RAG-GPT-5, RAG-GPT-4, and RAG-GPT-5. Eight head and neck oncologic surgeons scored each recommendation for appropriateness, clarity, specificity, and feasibility using 5-point Likert scales. Paired permutation testing and inter-rater reliability were assessed. RESULTS: LLM outputs showed close alignment with expert recommendations. RAG-based models achieved the highest mean scores across domains, with some statistically significant differences versus the expert comparator in appropriateness and clarity; however, absolute differences were modest. Inter-rater reliability was strong (ICC 0.73-0.87). CONCLUSIONS: Advanced LLMs can generate guideline-concordant management recommendations in simulated head and neck cancer cases, supporting potential utility for decision support and education; prospective validation and expert oversight remain essential.</description>

A subset of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Data regarding HPV-driven HNSCC from low- and middle-income countries is lacking. METHODS: A cross-sectional multicentre study of adult patients diagnosed with primary HNSCC between 2016 and 2020 was carried out. HPV status was determined through detection of high-risk HPV mRNA via in situ hybridization (RNAISH). Tumours were classified as being HPV-driven when there was positivity for RNAISH. p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) and HPV DNA detection and genotyping (HPVDNA) via a PCR-based method were also carried out. The prognostic utility of RNAISH, p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) alone and combined p16INK4a &amp; HPVDNA were assessed using survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 356 cases of HNSCC were assessed for HPV status. Median age was 64 years (IQR: 15), and 69.9% of patients were males. The prevalence of HPV-driven HNSCC was approximately 11.0% (95% CI: 7.9-14.7%). The vast majority of HPV-driven HNSCC were from the oropharynx (94.9%). None of the tumours originating from the oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx were HPV-driven. Seven different genotypes were found in HPV-driven HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, HPV-driven HNSCC was primarily encountered in tumours originating from the oropharynx. HPV16 was the most frequently encountered genotype in our cohort. It is recommended that determination of HPV status be based on single testing with RNAISH or dual testing of p16INK4a IHC in conjunction with HPVDNA as an acceptable alternative in resource limited settings to improve patient stratification for treatment as well as clinical outcomes.</description>

METHODS: This prospective, single-center, and randomized controlled trial included 196 patients with PTC who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ETGUA group (n = 98) or the open thyroidectomy group (n = 98). Complications within 30 days, parathyroid function [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium], and short-term oncological outcomes were observed. Secondary outcomes included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative recovery, pain score, cosmetic satisfaction, and hospitalization cost. RESULTS: The ETGUA group had a significantly longer operative time than the open thyroidectomy group, less intraoperative blood loss, more postoperative drainage at postoperative day 1, as well as a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all p &lt; 0.05). At 1 year postoperatively, surgical efficacy and oncological indicators such as the number of lymph nodes dissected, number of positive lymph nodes, stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) level, and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy were comparable between groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ETGUA group reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and higher cosmetic satisfaction, though the total hospitalization cost was slightly higher (all p &lt; 0.05). The learning curve analysis indicated that operative time and intraoperative blood loss stabilized after approximately 30-40 cases. CONCLUSION: ETGUA demonstrates comparable safety and oncological efficacy to conventional open thyroidectomy in PTC patients.</description>

METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included patients who underwent a salvage oropharyngectomy in an irradiated neck for recurrent or metachronous oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) between 2014 and 2023. RESULTS: Ninety-four patients were included. Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and local recurrence-free survival (LRFS) were 31.7%, 58.5%, and 55.2%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, pN+ status (HR 2.32; p = 0.031), pT status ≥ 3 (HR 2.03; p = 0.020), and age (HR 1.05; p = 0.014) were associated with OS. DSS was associated with pT status ≥ 3 (HR 5.24; p &lt; 0.001), metachronous (vs. recurrent) OPSCC (HR 0.32; p = 0.006), and cN+ status (HR 2.31; p = 0.053). LRFS was associated with metachronous OPSCC (HR 0.30; p = 0.002) and pT status ≥ 3 (HR 3.60; p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This last-resort procedure is associated with poor survival outcomes. In this series, patients with p16-positive OPSCC did not fare better than their p16-negative counterparts.</description>

Evidence suggests that LN colonization induces systemic immunosuppression, facilitating distant metastasis. We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-γ signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Le Tourneau C, Liem X, Nguyen F, Deraedt S, Salas S, Calugaru V, Serrahima MP, Wong Hee Kam S, Hoffmann C, Lesnik M, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4939'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4939&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609775/'&gt;41609775&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Intratumoral delivery of NBTXR3 radioenhancer followed by radiation therapy (RT) previously demonstrated safety and feasibility in cisplatin-ineligible and cetuximab-ineligible patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a dose-escalation phase 1 study. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate safety and preliminary efficacy of NBTXR3 followed by RT in patients with locally advanced HNSCC ineligible to receive concurrent systemic therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This single-arm, phase 1 dose-expansion nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted across 20 centers in Europe between March 4, 2019, and January 10, 2022. Patients were ineligible for cisplatin and cetuximab per investigator's judgement and had unresectable T3-4 or overall stage III/IVA HNSCC (per the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, eighth edition) of the oral cavity or oropharynx. Data were analyzed from July to August 2023. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received a single intratumoral administration of NBTXR3 in the primary tumor at the recommended dose of 22% of estimated tumor volume (ETV) followed by RT (70 Gy over 35 fractions). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes were safety and efficacy assessed by the objective response rate (ORR) of the NBTXR3-injected primary tumor. Other outcomes included ORR of all lesions (injected primary tumor and noninjected involved lymph nodes), progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 56 patients treated, the median (range) age was 72 (44-89) years, 40 (71%) were men, 34 (61%) were 70 years and older, and 36 (64%) had a substantial burden of comorbidities (age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score of 4 or greater). Median (range) follow-up was 33.0 (0.7-44.6) months. NBTXR3-related treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 9 patients (16%), of which 6 (11%) were grade 3 or higher, the most frequent being stomatitis (2 [4%]). Objective tumor response was assessed in 44 patients, as 12 patients were unable to complete RT or did not have posttreatment tumor assessment. In this evaluable patient population, the ORR of the injected primary tumor and ORR of all lesions were 82% (95% CI, 67-92) and 80% (95% CI, 65-90), respectively. Among all 56 treated patients, the median progression-free survival was 11.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 to not reached), and the median overall survival was 18.1 months (95% CI, 9.7 to not reached). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This dose-expansion phase 1 nonrandomized clinical trial demonstrated that intratumoral NBTXR3 followed by RT in a high-risk patient population unable to receive cisplatin or cetuximab was feasible and had a preliminary efficacy signal that supports a benefit-risk profile being evaluated in an ongoing randomized phase III trial.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang Y, Sun D, Zhou H, Zhou T, Qu S, Li J, Hu C, Xu M, Li W, Shen L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245'&gt;10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609753/'&gt;41609753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy is the current standard first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC). However, the long-term survival benefits at the 5-year benchmark remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding camrelizumab to chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS) as first-line treatment for RM-NPC, compared with chemotherapy alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CAPTAIN-1st trial was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial conducted at 28 hospitals in China. Between November 13, 2018, and November 29, 2019, patients with treatment-naive RM-NPC were enrolled. This secondary analysis of the CAPTAIN-1st trial was prespecified. Data analysis was conducted on June 1, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive camrelizumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or completion of 2 years of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary end point, progression-free survival per independent review committee, has been reported previously. Herein, the secondary end point of OS is reported as prespecified in the protocol. RESULTS: Among 263 randomized patients (134 in randomized to camrelizumab, 129 to placebo), baseline characteristics were generally balanced between groups, except for age. The mean (SD) age was 49 (11.25) years, and 218 patients (82.9%) were male individuals, 45 (17.1%) were female individuals. With a median survival follow-up of 63.5 (95% CI, 61.2-64.6) months for the camrelizumab group and 63.0 (95% CI, 60.8-64.6) months for the placebo group, 85 (63.4%) and 95 (73.6%) deaths occurred, respectively. Median OS was 34.5 months (95% CI, 29.4-45.7) with camrelizumab vs 26.6 months (95% CI, 19.8-33.5) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; 2-sided P = .047). After adjusting for age imbalance, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P = .01). The 5-year OS rates were 37.8% vs 24.2%, reflecting an absolute difference of 13.6% (95% CI, 2.4%-24.8%; P = .02) in favor of camrelizumab. The OS benefits were generally consistent across subgroups. In the camrelizumab group, patients who achieved rapid clearance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA had significantly longer OS compared with those without EBV DNA clearance (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful 5-year OS benefits compared with chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of RM-NPC. These findings provided the first 5-year evidence supporting the benefit of PD-1-based chemoimmunotherapy in this setting.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang SY, Turner G, Valdes-Morales KL, Hunter ER, Kim M, Tran VA, Polen K, Haynes D, Miller CJ, Etzkorn JR, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5211'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609724/'&gt;41609724&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine malignant neoplasm often affecting the head and neck. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely performed; however, the accuracy and reliability of SLNB for head and neck MCC remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of SLNB in head and neck MCC and inform pre- and post-SLNB risk stratification. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a single-center cohort study of patients with clinically node-negative head and neck MCC who underwent SLNB from January 2006 to January 2025; median (IQR) follow-up was 1.9 (0.8-4.6) years. Data analysis was conducted from April to November 2025. INTERVENTIONS: SLNB outcome and nodal disease status. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: SLNB accuracy measured by sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and false negative (FN) rate. FN SLNB was defined as regional nodal recurrence at the first site of recurrence after a negative SLNB without concurrent local or in-transit recurrence. Factors associated with failed SLNB (defined as nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy, inability to identify the sentinel lymph node intraoperatively, or absence of nodal tissue in the pathology specimen) were evaluated using effect-size measures. Cox proportional hazards model identified factors associated with nodal disease, comparing patients who developed nodal disease (identified by SLNB or subsequent clinical and/or imaging evaluation) with those who did not develop nodal disease during follow-up. RESULTS: Of 86 participants (mean [SD] age, 75.6 [9.6] years; 36 female [41.9%] and 50 male [58.1%] individuals) with clinically node-negative head and neck MCC, 69 (80.2%) underwent SLNB. Occult nodal disease was identified in 19 participants (27.5%). SLNB sensitivity was 52.6% (10 of 19 patients), NPV was 88.6% (31 of 35 patients), and FN rate was 26.7% (4 of 15 patients). SLNB failed in 29.0% (20 of 69 patients), with tumor location, female sex, and older age having medium to large effect on SLNB failure. Lymphovascular invasion, infiltrative growth pattern, and tumor size had the largest effect size on nodal disease with Cox analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this large single-site cohort study, SLNB remained a useful tool in head and neck MCC, identifying more than half of occult nodal disease. Given reduced performance in this region, patients with failed SLNB or negative SLNB plus high-risk features may benefit from tailored management, including intensified therapy and surveillance.</description>

We aim to analyze OPHL in terms of oncologic and functional results. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: University-affiliated tertiary care center. METHODS: All patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma who underwent open horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy (OHSL) and supracricoid partial laryngectomy (SCPL) between 2000 and 2020 at our institution were included. RESULTS: One hundred twelve patients were identified. 89% were male, with a mean age of 58 years old. Seventy had supraglottic tumors, while 42 had glottic tumors. OHSL was performed in 61 patients, while SCPL was in 51, of whom an arytenoid was resected in 9 patients and the epiglottis in 7. The series includes 30.4% T3-T4 classified tumors. Postoperative pneumonia appeared in 13.4% of patients. Decannulation was achieved in 93% of patients at a median of 14 days. The feeding tube was discontinued in 95% of patients at a median of 20 days. The mean follow-up was 91 months. The 5-year-LC rate was 90.2% in T1-T2 classified tumors and 80.9% in T3-T4 classified tumors. The 5-years-LEDFS was 72.1%. Total laryngectomy was performed in 14 patients: 11 following locoregional recurrence and the remaining 3 for functional reasons. Eleven patients maintained a tracheostomy or feeding tube for over 2 years. CONCLUSION: OPHL in selected patients with early and locally-advanced laryngeal tumors allows oncological results comparable to total laryngectomy while obtaining excellent stable functional results.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Online electronic survey. METHODS: An online survey was distributed via AHNS survey system. Participation was voluntary, and data were anonymously collected. RESULTS: 108 members (7.7% of AHNS members) responded. Most (65.7%) had ≥5 years of experience in the field. Few practitioners (23.2% always and 10.2% frequently) confirmed HPV-negative status with DNA/RNA in situ hybridization or PCR testing for p16-negative tumors. Most surgeons (60.2%) reported recommending TORS for identification of an unknown primary in a patient with p16-/HPV-negative neck mass. Similarly, at least half (56.5%) of surgeons indicated always or frequently treating resectable T1-T3 with TORS. The majority (73.2%) of surgeons indicated infrequently (59.3%) or never (13.9%) treating T3/T4 with traditional open surgery as first line. More than half of the surgeons (57.4%) believed survival is better with surgery compared to definitive nonsurgical therapy for HPV-negative OPSCC. There was wide variation in the use of treatment intensification (dual modality adjuvant treatment for T1-2N0, or tri-modality treatment for T1-T2N1), with 19.4% reporting never, 36.1% infrequently, 34.3% frequently, and 10.2% always doing so. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of AHNS surgeons (57.4%) believe survival for HPV-negative OPSCC is better with surgery. Most (56.5%) would treat resectable T1-T3 tumors with TORS, while the minority (26.8%) would frequently or always operate on T3-T4 tumors. There was wide variation in practice with respect to treatment intensifiication owing to remaining knowledge gaps in the field.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: The study was conducted in a high-volume, NCI-designated tertiary care setting. METHODS: Patients with HPV-negative OPSCC who underwent primary definitive TOS with risk-adapted adjuvant therapy (1998-2020) were identified. The primary outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative gastrostomy tube (G-tube) rates, tracheostomy rates, and functional outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) scores. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were treated with TOS for HPV-negative OPSCC. The majority of patients presented with late-stage disease (stage III/IV, 73%); 79% with early tumor stage (T1/T2) and 71% with positive nodal disease. Three-year estimates for OS and RFS for the entire cohort were 67.2% and 63.3% respectively. Advanced tumor stage predicted worsened OS [HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.75-5.95] and RFS [HR 2.38, 95% CI 1.13-5.01] on univariable analysis. Stage III/IV disease was associated with worsened OS [HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.01-4.63], but not RFS. Thirty-two patients (36%) recurred during the follow-up period; 19 (21%) failed locoregionally, and 13 (15%) failed distantly. Five patients (6%) were G-tube dependent and 3 patients (3%) were tracheostomy dependent at 1-year. CONCLUSION: Transoral surgery may be considered as a primary treatment in HPV-negative OPSCC with acceptable oncologic outcomes and the potential for improved functional outcomes.</description>

Diagnostic transoral robotic surgery (TORS) now routinely identifies occult primary tumors previously undetected by conventional methods. Here we analyze the histopathology of these tumors, demonstrating novel patterns of submucosal spread in predominantly microscopic tumors. PATIENTS/METHODS: Eighty patients with HPV-mediated hnSCCUP who underwent diagnostic TORS from 2013 to 2022, analyzing tumor histopathology and oncologic outcomes. RESULTS: Primary tumors were identified in 66 (83%) patients averaging 6 × 3 mm in diameter. These microscopic primaries produced cervical metastases over 6 times larger, with many exhibiting ribbon-like submucosal spread through lymphoepithelial crypts that evaded conventional detection. Almost all (98%) were T1 tumors; 71% measured &lt; 1 cm. At 38-month follow-up, 96% of patients remained alive without locoregional recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic TORS reveals that most HPV+ hnSCCUP are actually T1-microscopic oropharyngeal carcinomas, which might constitute a distinct clinical entity requiring new tailored treatment approaches.</description>

A subset is associated with high-risk HPV, but risk factors for HPV-associated sinonasal carcinoma (HPV-SNC) and HPV-independent disease remain poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate behavioral and clinical risk factors, including sexual history and substance use, and HPV antibody seropositivity in patients with HPV-SNC and HPV-independent SNC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multi-institutional case-case-control study was conducted from 2021 to 2024 at two NCI-designated cancer centers. Fifty-two patients with sinonasal carcinoma were enrolled; 37 completed a survey of demographic, clinical, and behavioral factors (24 HPV-SNC, 13 HPV-independent SNC) and serology was obtained for 36 (24 HPV-SNC, 12 HPV-independent SNC). Control noncancer otolaryngology patients (n = 148) from a recent prior study were matched 4:1. EXPOSURE: Self-reported history of sexual behaviors, substance use, and medical history via electronic survey; serum testing for antibodies to low- and high-risk HPV E6, E7, E1, E2, and L1 oncoproteins using a multiplex bead-based assay. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Odds of HPV-SNC or HPV-independent SNC diagnosis in relation to risk factors; differences in HPV seropositivity between groups. RESULTS: Among the 37 cancer patients who completed the survey, a history of tonsillectomy was significantly associated with reduced odds of HPV-SNC (OR 0.28, CI 0.09-0.86). No other factors explored (sexual behavior, substance use, or other clinical factors) were associated with HPV-associated SNC and HPV-independent SNC. Seroprevalence of anti-HPV16 E6 was significantly higher among HPV-associated SNC cases than either controls or HPV-independent SNC (45.8% vs. 0% and 13.1%), HPV-16 E6 (18.2% vs. 0% and 4.0%), and HPV-16 early proteins (16.7% vs. 0% and 0%) than HPV-independent SNC patients or controls, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: HPV-SNC exhibits distinct serologic features without clear behavioral risk factors. The protective association of tonsillectomy suggests lymphoid tissue may play a role in HPV-associated sinonasal oncogenesis. In contrast, the absence of identifiable risk factors for HPV-independent SNC highlights the need for further etiologic studies.</description>

This study uncovers the pivotal role of extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness in driving ATC aggressiveness through mechanotransduction mediated by the Integrin α6β4/Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) axis. By engineering collagen-coated polyacrylamide hydrogels with tunable rigidity, we demonstrated that high ECM stiffness (60 kPa) markedly enhanced ATC cell proliferation, clonogenicity, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, stiff matrices induced cytoskeletal reorganization, activated RhoA/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling, and upregulated Integrin α6β4-FAK pathway components, as validated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and functional assays. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK reversed stiffness-dependent tumor-promoting effects in vitro. In vivo, mice injected with tumor cells pre-cultured on high-stiffness ECM-mimicking hydrogels exhibited accelerated subcutaneous tumor growth and increased lung metastatic burden, which were significantly attenuated by FAK-targeted therapy. These findings establish ECM stiffness as a biomechanical determinant of ATC progression and metastasis, offering novel insights into microenvironment-driven malignancy and highlighting FAK as a promising therapeutic target to disrupt mechanosignaling in ATC.</description>

As immunotherapy has become the first-line treatment for HNSCC, resistance to anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents has emerged as a pivotal challenge. This prospective, single arm, phase II study (NCT05721443) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, combined with cetuximab in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Patients diagnosed with p16-negative R/M HNSCC resistant to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy without prior cetuximab treatment were enroled. Patients received oral dalpiciclib (150 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) and intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly in each cycle). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. Between March 2023 and November 2024, a total of 28 patients were enroled. The ORR was 67.9% (19/28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49.0%-82.0%), which met our primary endpoint. With a median follow-up of 9.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.98-14.12), the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.13- not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 10.75-23.25). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in all patients, predominantly grade 1-2. Grade 3 TRAEs included neutrophil count decreased (9/28, 32.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (9/28, 32.1%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. Dalpiciclib combined with cetuximab was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.</description>

We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

Whether the same prognostic significance holds with surgical treatment such as transoral robotic surgery (TORS) is less well studied. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary care academic center. METHODS: Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC treated with TORS from January 2016 to December 2023 were included. Demographics, smoking history, disease characteristics, treatment, and oncologic outcomes were collected. RESULTS: 156 patients were included. 87.2% were male with median age 60.0 years. Seventy-seven were never smokers, 63 former smokers, and 16 current smokers, with a median 20 pack-years among ever smokers. Three local, 6 regional, and ten distant metastases were identified, with 6 deaths, over a median 2.2 years of follow up. When comparing never, former, and current smokers, ever smokers demonstrated more advanced pathologic nodal staging (P = .03) and extranodal extension (P = .05). When comparing never and ever smokers, never smokers were younger (P = .04), and primary site differed with borderline significance (P = .05). Ever smokers again had more advanced nodal stage (P = .01) and extranodal extension (P = .02). There were no significant differences in adjuvant treatment, disease recurrence, or death by smoking history. There were no significant differences apart from age when analyzed using a 10 or 20-pack-year smoking history cutoff (P = .01, P = .02). CONCLUSION: Smoking history is associated with more advanced nodal stage and extranodal extension. However, smoking does not appear to influence recurrence or death in the setting of HPV-associated OPSCC definitively treated with TORS.</description>

Despite curative-intent therapy, 10% to 50% of patients experience recurrence. Prognosis for recurrent or metastatic disease is poor, with limited treatment options, underscoring the need for accurate prognostic models to guide treatment escalation or de-escalation and avoid over-treatment. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prognostic study of patients undergoing curative-intent surgery at Samsung Medical Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary/Massachusetts General Hospital from 2008 to 2024. Baseline clinicopathologic variables were integrated with longitudinal laboratory measurements from surveillance. A random 80/20 split defined development and internal-validation cohorts. Using XGBoost, we trained two models to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from each visit. RESULTS: A total of 975 patients with HNSCC (oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal subsites) were included. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year RFS from the surveillance time point were 0.785 (sensitivity, 72.8%; specificity, 71.5%), 0.831 (79.7%; 73.7%), 0.788 (74.0%; 73.3%), 0.769 (72.6%; 70.5%), and 0.795 (72.1%; 74.7%), respectively. For OS prediction, AUCs were 0.788 (72.1%; 73.6%), 0.797 (75.7%; 71.8%), 0.796 (81.0%; 68.4%), 0.820 (77.5%; 76.5%), and 0.815 (75.8%; 75.8%), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the model showed strong OS prediction in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, with AUCs of 0.943, 0.736, 0.699, 0.835, and 0.765 at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years, respectively. In non-HPV-positive HNSCC, OS AUCs ranged from 0.780 to 0.813 and RFS AUCs from 0.774 to 0.830 across the same time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model using multimodal and longitudinal data accurately predicted RFS and OS at multiple time points following curative-intent surgery for HNSCC.</description>

Quantitative imaging may provide scalable biomarkers to individualise care. Quantitative imaging can support baseline risk stratification, early on-treatment decision-making, and posttreatment surveillance in HPV-positive OPSCC. Real-world translation requires standardised reporting, calibration/harmonisation across centres, rigorous model validation, and workflow integration with radiotherapy planning. Quantitative MRI, CT, and PET, augmented by radiomics and AI, show convergent promise as non-invasive biomarkers to enable safe individualisation of therapy in HPV-positive OPSCC, contingent on methodological rigour and prospective, externally validated studies. Despite this promise, clinical translation faces substantial barriers, including limited external validation, heterogeneous methodologies, and the need for standardised, prospectively validated pipelines.</description>

Understanding the roles of ubiquitination-related genes in THCA progression and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment (TME) could provide valuable insights into prognosis and treatment strategies. METHODS: Using iUUCD 2.0, ubiquitination-related genes were identified and subjected to consensus clustering on TCGA-THCA data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor and normal tissues were identified and used to construct a ubiquitination-related signature using Cox and LASSO regression. The signature's prognostic ability was validated using training and test datasets from TCGA. Immune cell infiltration, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity were analyzed. RESULTS: Three ubiquitination clusters were identified among 454 genes. Four prognostic DEGs (F12, FBXO15, FBXW10, and USP44) formed the signature, significantly correlating with survival, immune cell infiltration, clinical characteristics, immune checkpoints, immunotherapy response, and drug sensitivity. Low-risk THCA patients had better prognosis and immunotherapy responses than high-risk patients. A stable nomogram combining the signature and clinical characteristics predicted patient survival. RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry confirmed differential expression of key genes. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies and validates a novel four-gene ubiquitination-related signature as a promising and independent prognostic biomarker in THCA. Beyond outcome prediction, this signature demonstrates significant translational potential by accurately predicting immunotherapy responses, thereby facilitating the development of more personalized and effective treatment strategies for patients with THCA.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen H, Hu M, Feng M, Chen X, Guo X, Guo J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1680008'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1680008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41626166/'&gt;41626166&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Lip and oral cavity cancer (LOC) is a major public health challenge in Asia. Nevertheless, a critical gap remains in understanding the epidemiological burden of LOC among young people (15-44 years) in the region. This study aims to analyze the burden and risk factors of LOC in this age group across the four Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Asian regions from 1990 to 2021 and projects trends to 2030. METHODS: Data on the incidence, deaths, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and risk factors of LOC from 1990 to 2021 were obtained from the GBD 2021 study for East, South, Southeast Asia, and High-income Asia Pacific. This study assessed the LOC burden among young people (15-44 years) through age- and sex-stratified analyses, evaluated temporal trends via joinpoint regression, examined risk factor contributions, and projected trends to 2030 using the Nordpred age-period-cohort model. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2021, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) increased across all subregions, with the largest rise in East Asia. In contrast, age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) and age-standardized DALYs rate declined everywhere except South Asia. In 2021, South Asia bore the heaviest LOC burden among young people in the four Asian subregions. India reported the highest incident cases, deaths, and DALYs in 2021, and Pakistan had the highest ASR for all three metrics. Taiwan (Province of China) showed the largest increase in ASRs over the period. In 2021, smoking had the highest contribution in East Asia, alcohol use in High-income Asia Pacific, and chewing tobacco in South Asia. Projections to 2030 indicate rising ASIR in East, South, and Southeast Asia but declines in High-income Asia Pacific; decreasing ASMR everywhere except South Asia; and increasing age-standardized DALYs rate in East and South Asia but decreases elsewhere. CONCLUSIONS: LOC imposes a substantial and growing burden on young people in South, East, and Southeast Asia, marked by rising ASIR since 1990 and projected increases through 2030. South Asia faces the most urgent challenge with concurrent rises in incidence, mortality, and DALYs-most notably in the 20-24 age group. Region-specific interventions targeting predominant risk factors are critically needed.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuan X, Xu L, Gong C, Jian J, Zheng W, Luo C, Zhang Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1727150'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1727150&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41626163/'&gt;41626163&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: In radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), balancing target coverage with protection of adjacent organs remains challenging. This study aimed to evaluated the cumulative dose deviations resulting from different planning target volume (PTV) margins during tomotherapy (TOMO) using megavoltage computed tomography (MVCT) and investigated the feasibility of individualized margin optimization, with the goal of minimizing volume and protecting surrounding tissues. METHODS: Forty patients with NPC treated with TOMO were retrospectively analyzed. Daily MVCT scans were acquired throughout treatment. Using deformable image registration, the dose from each fraction was mapped to the planning CT, and cumulative doses were reconstructed using MIM software. For each patient, isotropic 1-4 mm virtual expansions were applied to the gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) to generate "virtual" structures. These were evaluated for V100% dose coverage under the accumulated dose. Planned and accumulated doses were compared across expansion margins using V100%, D95%, conformity index, and homogeneity index, with differences assessed by paired t-tests. Dose variations in organs at risk (OARs) were also assessed. RESULTS: Planned and accumulated V100% doses were within 5% for most targets, however, certain virtual expansions demonstrated detectable dose discrepancies. For GTVnx, a +2 mm margin significantly reduced accumulated V100% (96.55% ± 3.04%) compared with the planned dose (99.18% ± 0.73%; p &lt; 0.001). For GTVnd, both +1 mm and +2 mm margins significantly reduced accumulated V100% (99.21% ± 1.17% and 99.20% ± 1.17%, respectively; p &lt; 0.01). For CTV1, a +2 mm margin yielded higher accumulated V100% (99.57% ± 1.49%) than planned (99.89% ± 0.21%; p = 0.212), suggesting deformation-related over-coverage. Larger margins (3-4 mm) reduced coverage, though not significantly. For CTV2, accumulated V100% remained consistent across all margins. The +1 mm expansion produced a small but significant increase (99.72% ± 0.38% vs 99.99% ± 0.23%; p = 0.006), while larger expansions (2-4 mm) had no effect, suggesting 1-2 mm may be optimal. CONCLUSION: MVCT-based cumulative dose evaluation provides a more accurate assessment of the delivered dose than conventional geometric methods. Individualized, dose-driven PTV margin strategies may improve tumor coverage while minimizing OAR exposure, thereby advancing precision radiotherapy for NPC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kwan D, Kwan W, Badwal A, Puol T, Deng JZ, Wang R, Ahmed S, Mansfield A, Fazelzad R, Jones J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18020286'&gt;10.3390/cancers18020286&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41595205/'&gt;41595205&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purpose: The effectiveness and feasibility of cancer prehabilitation have been well-validated in surgical settings, but its role in non-surgical treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT), remains unclear. This scoping review aims to systematically explore the existing literature on prehabilitation programs for non-surgical cancer treatments. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute, seven databases were systematically searched from their inception to October 2024 for peer-reviewed studies involving prehabilitation prior to non-surgical treatment. Data were extracted and reported adhering to PRISMA-ScR guidelines, using a convergent synthesis design to present qualitative and quantitative evidence. No formal risk-of-bias or quality appraisal was conducted. Results: Of 22,122 studies, 39 met the inclusion criteria, yielding a combined sample of 6073 patients and thirty-four unique interventions. Sample sizes ranged from 9 to 1992, with randomized control trials being the most common (16). Head and neck cancer was the most frequently studied, followed by breast, esophageal/gastric, and lung cancer. Of the included interventions, 23 were unimodal and 16 were multimodal. Exercise was the most common component (30), with nutrition (13), psychosocial (10), and educational (8) components also present. Most efficacy studies (84%) reported improved outcomes and nearly all (93%) feasibility studies found prehabilitation acceptable and implementable. Conclusions: This review highlights a growing body of literature examining prehabilitation prior to chemotherapy or RT in adult cancer patients, with studies suggesting potential benefits and feasibility. However, long-term trials, especially in diverse cancers and older populations, remain scarce. Our results provide insight into future implementation, evaluation of outcomes, and directions for future prehabilitation research.</description>

Dutch guidelines recommend a care pathway interval (CPI) of a maximum of 30 days, and a free bone margin of at least 5 mm. Fused MRI and CT data are used for accurate tumor delineation. Based on this data, a virtual surgical plan is created and transferred to the operating room using resection guides and patient-specific implants (PSIs). Long-term evaluation is needed to further optimize its clinical use. Objectives: This study evaluates adherence to bone margin and CPI guidelines in mandibular OSCC. Additionally, it assesses the accuracy of tumor resection and reconstruction using 3D-VSP and compares the complications of 3D-planned mandibular reconstruction using different kinds of osteosynthesis plates. Methods: All patients who underwent a segmental mandibulectomy between 2014 and 2024 at the University Medical Center Groningen were included. CPI, clinical outcomes, and complications were analyzed. The preoperative virtual plan was compared with the postoperative outcome to assess accuracy. Results: The median CPI was 34 days, and 93.7% of bone margins were tumor-free. Mean absolute resection deviation was 1.63 mm (±1.42). PSI reconstructions were significantly more accurate in intergonial distance and coronal angle compared to conventional plates. Plate-related complications were more common in non-bony reconstructions; PSI reconstructions showed significantly more plate exposure. Conclusions: 3D-VSP leads to high accuracy in resection and reconstruction and favorable bone margins. Shortening the CPI and reducing biological complications are essential to further improve oncological outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the methylation status, functional effects, and underlying mechanisms of BCAR3 in TC. METHODS: BCAR3 methylation was analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry in 422 TC and 371 benign thyroid nodule samples. Expression levels were assessed via immunohistochemistry, qPCR, and Western blot. Functional assays including proliferation, migration, and invasion were performed after BCAR3 knockdown. Rescue experiments using a PI3K activator were conducted to examine pathway mechanisms. RESULTS: BCAR3 was significantly hypomethylated in TC compared to benign tissues (p &lt; 0.001), with CpG_6 most strongly associated with TC risk (odds ratio, OR = 1.73, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, BCAR3 hypomethylation was more pronounced in cases with larger tumor size and advanced disease stage. Furthermore, BCAR3 methylation showed differential patterns across TC subtypes, with medullary thyroid carcinoma exhibiting the lowest methylation levels. BCAR3 expression was upregulated in TC tissues and cell lines (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, BCAR3 knockdown reduced phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR and altered expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker, characterized by an increase in E-cadherin and decreases in Vimentin and N-cadherin, and consequently suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion (p &lt; 0.05). Rescue experiments with a PI3K activator showed a trend towards restoration of these effects, although not to the level of the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: BCAR3 hypomethylation contributes to TC cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion by promoting AKT/mTOR activation and EMT. These findings highlight the potential of BCAR3 methylation as both a biomarker and a therapeutic target in TC.</description>

Dendritic cells, major regulators of specific anti-tumor immune response, are often impaired in their function in the context of cancer. METHODS: Monocyte-derived dendritic cells were incubated with isolated small extracellular vesicles during or after maturation. Cell surface markers and antigen processing machinery were assessed by flow cytometry. Vesicle-treated dendritic cells were tested for interleukin 12p70 production by ELISA, and differences in uptake of labeled vesicles were shown by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: Small extracellular vesicles derived from HPV(+) tumor cell lines increased maturation and activation of immature dendritic cells, priming them for more rapid phagocytosis. Immature dendritic cells co-incubated with vesicles had lower levels of antigen presenting machinery components and produced less IL12p70 than controls, while similarly co-incubated mature dendritic cells remained unaffected. Vesicles in plasma of patients with head and neck cancer inhibited functions of mature dendritic cells by downregulating expression of antigen presenting machinery components. CONCLUSION: Our results uncover mechanisms through which tumor-derived small extracellular vesicles modulate dendritic cell functions locally and systemically. These mechanisms may also affect dendritic cell-based vaccine efficacy.</description>

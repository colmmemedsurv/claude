Chronic rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous condition, characterized by various phenotypes that often coexist with comorbidities. While the standard treatment is commonly applied to chronic rhinosinusitis, a significant number of patients do not respond adequately to medical management and experience frequent relapses of nasal polyps. Current biologic therapies primarily target type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis; however, no specific treatments are available for non-type 2 or mixed forms. Tezepelumab, an anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody for severe asthma, emerges as a promising treatment for TSLP-driven diseases. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study involving 26 patients with severe asthma who also presented sinonasal symptoms. Clinical assessments included nasal endoscopy, nasal congestion scores, SNOT-22, visual analog scale, nasal airflow measurement, olfactory evaluation, and eosinophil count. All 26 patients completed at least 3 months of follow-up. RESULTS: We observed significant improvements in nasal endoscopy scores, nasal congestion scores, SNOT-22, visual analog scale, and olfactory function. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential of Tezepelumab as a versatile therapeutic option for both severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, including phenotypes previously excluded from biologic treatments. However, larger, more homogeneous studies are needed to confirm these findings. We believe that our real-world data may have important implications for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis, regardless of the underlying inflammatory phenotype.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Abu Bandora E, Hayat L, Ashkenazi Y, Oestreicher-Kedem Y, Nativ-Zeltzer N, Nachalon Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-10005-x'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-10005-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41566022/'&gt;41566022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To explore FEES findings obtained using different liquid types, water, cow's milk, and soy milk, with respect to observed penetration, aspiration, and pharyngeal residue, and to describe agreement across liquids. METHODS: Adult patients referred to a university-affiliated dysphagia clinic underwent standardized FEES using water, cow's milk, and soy milk during single and consecutive swallows. Evaluations were performed jointly by a laryngologist and a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Outcome measures included the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) and the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale. Inter-rater reliability was assessed through blinded reassessment of 25% of examinations by an additional laryngologist and two SLPs. RESULTS: Most swallows across all liquids were classified as safe. Unsafe PAS scores occurred numerically more frequently with cow's milk (18.2-25.6%), than with water (6.9-11.6%) or soy milk (9.4-11.6%). For single swallows, a nominal overall difference across liquids was observed (Cochran's Q = 6.00, p = 0.050), and for consecutive swallows an overall difference was also detected (Cochran's Q = 8.00, p = 0.018). Pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. No statistically significant differences were identified between liquids for vallecular or pyriform sinus residue. Agreement in PAS scores across liquids ranged from low to moderate (κ = 0.291-0.609), and agreement for residue scores ranged from moderate to almost perfect (κ = 0.528-0.824). Inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.93, 95% CI [0.90-0.95], p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory within-subject study, no statistically significant differences were observed in FEES penetration, aspiration, or pharyngeal residue scores when using water, cow's milk, or soy milk. These findings provide preliminary descriptive data regarding the behavior of a commonly consumed plant-based liquid during FEES and may inform future research on liquid properties in swallowing assessment.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the histopathological findings of postoperative specimens from patients with pHPT (single gland disease). The indication for surgery was based on increased plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations and the presence of symptoms typical of pHPT. To quantify approximate oxyphil cell content (OCC), we determined the percentage of oxyphil cells observed in each specimen. To quantify the approximate lesion volume, we determined the diameters of the fresh specimen (length, width, and height). Multiplying the lesion volume by the approximated relative OCC yielded an estimate of absolute OCC. Approximated absolute and relative OCC were then compared with preoperative plasma iPTH and calcium concentrations. Associations between these parameters were calculated using logistic or linear regression analysis. RESULTS: We studied 76 patients with pHPT. Increasing approximate relative OCC predicted slightly lower calcium concentration (indirect non-linear association, adjusted estimate 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-1.40, p = 0.044). However, only in large lesions (&gt; 1.5 cm3) was high approximate OCC (&gt; 10%) associated with lower iPTH levels (adjusted odds ratio for "volume by content" interaction 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.52, p = 0.018). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with approximated absolute OCC as the variable of interest. CONCLUSION: In patients with pHPT, a higher approximate OCC was associated with slightly lower calcium concentrations, possibly mediated by a counter regulatory effect on iPTH production, especially in large lesions.</description>

Here, we converted bictegravir (BIC), a potent daily oral antiretroviral drug, into monomeric and homodimeric ester prodrugs. The homodimeric prodrug nanosuspension, NMXBIC, shows sustained plasma BIC levels &gt; 16 times the protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC95) for six months after a single injection in Sprague Dawley rats. The results paralleled a short PK tail with the potential for late dose forgiveness. The monomeric prodrug nanosuspension, NM2BIC, shows lower year-long plasma BIC concentrations above PA-IC95 after a single injection. After repeated injections, NMXBIC and NM2BIC are well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits. NMXBIC's physicochemical properties and high BIC loading/unit mass of the prodrug contribute to its unique ULA PK profile. These results support its development as a ULA formulation for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.</description>

However, numerous patients develop resistance to NACT and thus fail to benefit from it. Therefore, identifying reliable biomarkers to predict patient responsiveness to NACT remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate that elevated expression of INCENP and CDCA8 contributes to poor NACT responsiveness across multiple cancers. Mechanistically, the 5'UTR (GGACT at position 113) of INCENP and the 3'UTR (GGACT at position 1041) of CDCA8 undergo m⁶A methylation and are recognized by YTHDF3, which facilitates their translation through interaction with eIF3A, ultimately driving poor response to NACT. Moreover, inhibition of INCENP and CDCA8 enhances NACT sensitivity by promoting multipolar spindle formation. Collectively, our findings establish that INCENP and CDCA8 serve as crucial biomarkers for predicting NACT responsiveness and as potential therapeutic targets for combination therapy with NACT to improve patient survival.</description>

New approaches to texture analysis continue to be developed. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics studies for identifying histological subtypes of lung cancer remain scarce. This study aimed to improve the efficiency of the computer-aided non-invasive diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by supplementing the statistical approaches to MRI image texture analysis with entropy-based methods. The study included 31 patients with NSCLC, categorized into two histological groups containing 12 patients (75 images) with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 19 patients (79 images) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A total of 154 MRI images were annotated using 154 regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs were extracted, filtered using normalize and median filtrations, and analyzed using standard statistical approaches and novel entropy-based methods. Texture features were selected using Select From Model (SFM) protocol and the classified using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), separately. After 5-fold stratified cross-validation, the LR algorithm achieved the highest classification performance (0.75 accuracy and 0.78 presision) on the combined statistical and entropy-based texture features extracted from MRI images after median filtration. The proposed protocol presented higher efficiency than protocols that worked only on the statistical texture features on unfiltered or normalize filtered MRI images; therefore, it may be suggested for further research on the computer-aided diagnosis of NSCLC histological subtypes.</description>

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 74 incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who commenced thrice-weekly HD at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, between 2012 and 2018. A total of 83 candidate variables, including demographics, traditional indicators (Kt/V, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone [PTH], albumin, hemoglobin, ultrafiltration volume), and dialysis machine parameters, were evaluated. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression identified predictors of 1.5-year outcomes. RESULTS: The mean (± SD) age of the study population was 62 ± 14 years, and 55.4% were male. Independent predictors included serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measured at month 3 and machine-derived bicarbonate conductivity (BC) at month 6. A model combining ALP (month 3), bicarbonate conductivity (month 6), and traditional indicators (month 6) showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.82). Achieving targets in ≥5 of 8 indicators-including ALP and BC-was associated with significantly better outcomes (log-rank p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Integrating ALP and machine-derived BC into a Cox model significantly improves risk stratification in incident HD patients and facilitates the implementation of automated quality control.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To determine the 10-year appendicitis recurrence and appendectomy rate in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated with antibiotics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing appendectomy with antibiotics at 6 Finnish hospitals from November 2009 to June 2012, where 530 patients (aged 18-60 years) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis diagnosed by computed tomography were randomly assigned to appendectomy (n = 273) or antibiotics (n = 257). Last follow-up was April 29, 2024. This current analysis focused on assessing the 10-year appendicitis recurrence rate among patients assigned to antibiotics. INTERVENTIONS: Open appendectomy vs antibiotics with intravenous ertapenem sodium (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times/d). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified 10-year secondary end points included late (after 1 year) appendectomy and appendicitis recurrence rate after antibiotics and complications. Post hoc outcomes included the detection of possible appendiceal tumors among patients in the antibiotic group undergoing appendectomy or with an intact appendix using magnetic resonance imaging. Additional post hoc outcomes were quality of life and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: At 10-year follow-up, 253/257 patients (98.4%) randomized to receive antibiotics (median age, 33 years; 102 [40.3%] female) were assessed for appendicitis recurrence, with a true appendicitis recurrence rate (appendicitis at histopathology) of 37.8% (95% CI, 31.6%-44.1% [87/230]) and a cumulative appendectomy rate of 44.3% (95% CI, 38.2%-50.4% [112/253]). Overall, the 10-year cumulative complication rate in the group randomized to appendectomy was 27.4% (95% CI, 21.6%-33.3% [62/226]) and 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8%-12.1% [19/224]) in the group randomized to receive antibiotics (P &lt; .001). There was no observed significant difference in quality of life between antibiotics and appendectomy (387/530; median health index value, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.0] for both groups; P = .18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients initially treated with antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the rate of recurrence and appendectomy at 10-year follow-up supports the use of antibiotics as an option for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 46 adult COME patients from the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University who had failed a standardized 3-month non-surgical interventions and underwent one of three interventions: (1) TTI alone, (2) BDET + TTI, or (3) BDET alone. Preoperative evaluations included otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry (PTA), tympanometry, nasopharyngeal endoscopy, eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7), and temporal bone CT scans. Postoperative evaluation incorporated PTA, tympanometry, and ETDQ-7 assessment. Statistical analysis incorporated both within-group (pre-post) and between-group comparisons of therapeutic outcomes. RESULTS: All interventions demonstrated therapeutic safety with no postoperative complications. While all groups showed hearing improvement, the BDET group failed to achieve statistically significant improvement in air conduction (AC) thresholds. The BDET + TTI combination yielded superior outcomes to TTI alone in AC thresholds, air-bone gap (ABG), and ETDQ-7 scores improvements. Tympanometric normalization was significant in both TTI-containing groups but not in the BDET-alone group. CONCLUSIONS: While BDET monotherapy shows limited efficacy in adult COME management, its combination with TTI produces superior therapeutic outcomes compared to either procedure alone. These results position BDET as a potentially valuable adjunct to conventional TTI rather than an independent treatment modality for this patient population.</description>

Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring uses EEG signals to quantify anesthetic depth. We conducted a prospective study to examine changes in VOTE scores and pharyngeal opening pressure (PhOP) during DISE with positive airway pressure (DISE-PAP), at light and deep sedation. METHODS: Anesthetic depth was monitored using BIS during DISE-PAP for 17 patients. We classified BIS ≥ 55 as light sedation and &lt; 55 as deep sedation. The DISE exam was performed and subsequently PAP applied to assess PhOP at both light and deep sedation. We defined PhOP as the minimum pressure wherein all areas of the airway were opened. A blinded evaluation of the procedure video was performed by either one of two sleep surgery fellows or an attending sleep surgeon to create a VOTE score for the DISE exam and PhOP. RESULTS: All n = 17 patients enrolled had OSA with a mean AHI of 30.5 and standard deviation 17.8. PhOP significantly correlated with BIS readings (rho = -0.45, p = 0.0328) but VOTE classification did not significantly correlate with BIS level (rho = 0.18, p = 0.189). The velum and epiglottis had opening pressures that correlated to BIS level (rho = -0.398; p = 0.044) and (rho = -0.426; p = 0.038), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetic depth measured by BIS correlates with airway resistance as measured by PhOP. PAP appears to be a useful tool during DISE as it gives a highly titratable and immediate measurement of pharyngeal collapsibility.</description>

METHODS: Medical records and video recordings of patients with vocal fold polyps or cysts who underwent OBLS between November 2023 and September 2025 were reviewed. Demographic data included age, gender, history of smoking, history of reflux disease, type of vocal fold pathology, and type of office-based laryngeal procedure. Prevalence, morphology, and disease regression of CRLs were assessed by two otolaryngologists who independently reviewed the video recordings of patients included in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-six males and 19 females were included in the study. The mean age was 48.9 ± 14.9 years. The prevalence of CRLs was 60%. Most of these lesions were fibrous. Eighteen lesions were treated with ILSI, and 8 lesions were treated with the blue laser and steroid injection. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Analysis of 21 CRLs showed complete disease regression in 52.4% of cases, and partial disease regression in 47.6% of cases. There was no statistically significant difference in disease regression between the two treatment subgroups (p = 0.284). There was a statistically significant difference in total disease regression of the primary lesion between those who had partial vs. complete disease regression of their CRL (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: CRLs are common in patients with vocal fold polyps and cysts. All lesions regressed partially or completely following OBLS using the blue laser and/or steroid injection.</description>

Offering a choice of PrEP modalities integrated with peer support and delivered through community-based sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services will overcome these challenges. We describe the design of a trial to evaluate this approach at a population level. METHODS: We are conducting a type 1a hybrid effectiveness, phase 3B, cluster randomised controlled trial (LAPIS) to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of offering PrEP modality choices through community-based SRH services amongst youth aged 15-30 years living in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. LAPIS is nested within Thetha nami ngithethe nawe (Let's Talk), an ongoing stepped-wedge trial with two periods investigating the effectiveness, implementation, and cost effectiveness of peer-led social mobilisation into decentralised integrated HIV and SRH services on the population prevalence of sexually transmissible HIV amongst youth. In the second period of Thetha nami, 40 trial clusters were randomised 1:1 to receive either a choice of PrEP modalities (oral PrEP, long-acting PrEP, i.e., two-monthly injectable cabotegravir (CAB LA) or dapivirine vaginal ring and HIV post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP] packs) or enhanced standard of care (ESoC) with oral PrEP only. All trial clusters are supported by peer navigators offering peer support and visited monthly by a mobile nurse-led clinic offering adolescent and youth-friendly HIV and SRH services. There are two primary outcomes: (1) effective uptake of PrEP or PEP, and (2) retention on PrEP, defined as attending at least one follow-up appointment after PrEP/PEP initiation, which are based on clinic data. Implementation outcomes are assessed using a mixed-methods and process evaluation following the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. DISCUSSION: LAPIS is a pragmatic trial to evaluate the addition of long-acting PrEP modalities to daily oral PrEP within community-based SRH services. By offering PrEP choices, LAPIS adopts a person-centred approach to improve adherence and retention among youth, including hidden key populations. Findings will provide insights into the real-world implementation of CAB-LA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier-NCT06250504. Registered: 01 February 2024.</description>

A planned sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate whether sleep-related item content influences associations with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Fifty adults with CRSsNP completed the NOSE-E, SNOT-22, and CRS-PRO questionnaires. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, allergic rhinitis, asthma, OSA, and prior nasal surgery, were recorded. Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were used to identify independent predictors for each PROM. A predefined sleep-free analysis excluded sleep- and fatigue-related items (NOSE-E item 4; SNOT-22 items 11-14; CRS-PRO items 9-10). RESULTS: Each PROM demonstrated a distinct predictor profile. In multivariable models, age and smoking independently predicted NOSE-E scores. Previous nasal surgery was the only independent predictor of SNOT-22 scores. Age and OSA were associated with CRS-PRO scores in the primary model; however, the OSA association disappeared in the sleep-free analysis, indicating that it was driven by sleep-related item content rather than sinonasal symptomatology. All models showed modest explanatory capacity (adjusted R² ≈ 0.10-0.19). CONCLUSION: Systemic and lifestyle factors exert instrument-specific influences on symptom reporting in CRSsNP. The apparent association between OSA and CRS-PRO is mediated by sleep-related items, underscoring the importance of considering domain structure when selecting and interpreting PROMs. PROM-based evaluations in CRSsNP should incorporate domain-aware interpretation and caution in patients with sleep comorbidities.</description>

We aimed to test whether facial emotion analysis can quantitatively evaluate patients' emotional responses before and after each rehabilitation session and whether these changes relate to conventional subjective/physiological stress markers and discharge physical outcomes. We conducted a single-center prospective observational study of 32 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy or esophagectomy between August 2024 and February 2025. Immediately before and after each rehabilitation session, 30 s iPad video interviews (median, six per patient) were recorded and analyzed using MAL Face Emotion software to obtain normalized scores (0%-100%) for Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, and Surprised emotions. Subjective stress (0-100 mm visual analog scale) and salivary α-amylase activity were collected concurrently; discharge physical function was assessed using the 6 min walk distance and Five Times Sit-to-Stand tests. Pre- and post-session values were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and associations were examined with age-adjusted regression and Spearman correlation. Thirty-one patients completed the study without adverse events. After rehabilitation, the Happy score increased (median +3.5%, p = 0.013) and stress decreased (-1.5 mm, p = 0.025), whereas salivary α-amylase and other emotions were unchanged. Changes in the Happy score (p = 0.21) and stress (p = 0.19) did not predict discharge physical function, whereas changes in the Sad score correlated moderately with changes in salivary α-amylase (ρ = 0.45). The findings of this single-center study provide preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of facial emotion analysis as a non-invasive, quantitative tool for real-time psychological monitoring during postoperative rehabilitation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate its potential to support a more personalized delivery of cancer rehabilitation.</description>

While stress physiology has been extensively studied in clinical populations, few studies have systematically examined the association between academic stress and multiple salivary biomarkers in undergraduates, particularly with attention to sex differences. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between self-reported academic stress survey measured via the SISCO inventory and four salivary biomarkers of cellular inflammation: cortisol, interleukin-1β, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulin A in 81 undergraduates (53 females, 28 males). Biomarker levels were quantified using ELISA, and data were analyzed via multivariate approaches (ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and linear regression modeling). Participants were categorized as low (37%), moderate (35%), and high (28%) stress levels based on SISCO scores. Although no statistically significant associations were found between SISCO scores and individual biomarkers, multivariate analysis revealed a predictive model (R² = 0.14) combining all four biomarkers, with stress level predictions within ±20% of observed values. Males in the high-stress score showed lower cortisol trends but higher proinflammatory markers compared to females, suggesting divergent physiological stress responses by sex. These findings provide preliminary evidence for sex-differential association in self-reported academic stress with biological markers of inflammation, highlighting the potential of biomarker panels rather than single markers to capture the complexity of academic stress. In addition, this study establishes a methodological framework for combining psychometric tools with multi-biomarker analyses in stress research, addressing a critical gap in the literature on academic stress physiology.</description>

METHODS: Forty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 12 sham-operated rats (control group) and 36 operated rats (18 rats in the group with total thyroidectomy and 18 rats in the group with subtotal thyroidectomy). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) serum concentrations were measured prior to surgery and on postoperative days 14, 28 and 90; blood calcium (Ca), blood phosphorus (P), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were measured on postoperative day 10; and thyroglobulin (Tg) concentrations were measured on postoperative day 60. The postoperative behavioral status of the rats was comprehensively evaluated on the basis of behavioral indicators. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in preoperative TSH, FT4, or FT3 between the control and surgical groups (p &gt; 0.05). On postoperative day 10, there were no significant differences in Ca, P, or PTH levels among the groups (p &gt; 0.05). On postoperative days 14, 28 and 90, the TSH level was greater, whereas the FT4 and FT3 levels were lower in the surgical group (p &lt; 0.05). On the 60th postoperative day, the Tg was significantly lower in the surgical group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Surgical removal of the thyroid gland can be used to successfully establish a hypothyroid rat model that is stable and reliable and can provide a model basis for hypothyroidism-related research.</description>

A dataset of 277 PNS CT cases from Korea University Guro Hospital, supplemented by temporal and geographic external test sets, was utilized. A 3D U-Net model was employed to segment maxillary sinus regions. YOLO v5 identified calcifications, followed by classification into three patterns: normal sinus or chronic sinusitis without calcifications, dense peripheral dystrophic calcification, and central punctate fungal calcification. A separate convolutional neural network (CNN) refined the classification to ensure accurate categorization of calcification patterns. The 3D U-Net model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.9674, indicating accurate segmentation. YOLO v5 demonstrated precision of 79.50% and recall of 92.14% in detecting calcifications. The CNN classification model attained F1 scores of 94.73%, 90.60%, and 94.01%, and overall accuracies of 97.48%, 86.87%, and 94.01% for internal, temporal, and geographic test sets, respectively. This study demonstrated the capability of deep learning algorithms to accurately detect and classify fungal sinusitis-related calcifications on PNS CT scans. The developed framework achieved high accuracy in segmentation of sinus area and detection/classification of intrasinus calcifications. The framework also demonstrated its potential for broader application to radiographic imaging.</description>

Fluconazole (FLZ) is the standard treatment but concerns about emerging resistance and drug interaction highlight the need for alternative therapies. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), known for its antifungal and biofilm-disrupting properties, has been proposed as a potential alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and microbiome impact of a vaginal CHG formulation compared to oral FLZ in the treatment of RVVC caused by Candida albicans. METHODS: An open label randomized non-inferiority trial was conducted to compare vaginal CHG and FLZ treatments. Primary outcome was negative cultures for C. albicans. Resistance profiles and changes in the vaginal microbiome composition were also assessed. RESULTS: The study was terminated early due to local irritation associated with CHG and the study design was transitioned into a pilot study. CHG treatment showed comparable efficacy to FLZ in clearing C. albicans infections and preventing recurrences, although the sample size was limited. All 11 participants in the FLZ group cleared the infection after one week treatment, compared to 9 out 11 in the CHG group. No harmful changes to the vaginal microbiome were observed in the CGH or FLZ group. FLZ promoted a shift toward Lactobacillus crispatus dominance, unlike CHG. Notably, 16% of C. albicans isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility or resistance to FLZ. CONCLUSION: Due to the limited number of participants, we cannot conclusively determine whether CHG is non-inferior to FLZ in terms of efficacy for clearing acute C. albicans infections or preventing recurrences. While the current CHG formulation caused local irritation and is not suitable for clinical use, its antifungal and biofilm-inhibiting properties remain promising. Further development of less irritative CHG formulations may offer a valuable alternative for RVVC treatment, particularly in the context of rising FLZ resistance.</description>

However, data from Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, are limited. Songkhla, a province in southern Thailand, has a predominant occupation and religion across different geographic areas which may influencing the incidence. This study aimed to assess the trends in skin cancer incidence in Songkhla according to age, calendar period, birth cohort, and geographical areas. METHODS: The study included patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin between 1989 and 2020, as recorded in the Songkhla population-based cancer registry. Geographic areas were classified into four categories with remaining groups: urban VS rural, Muslim VS Buddhist, fishing and farming VS other occupations, and rubber plantation VS other occupations. Age-standardized incidence rates (per 100,000 population) were calculated, and trend analyses were performed using Joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of skin cancer in men declined after 2001 with annual percentage change rates of -2.24%, while it remained stable among women. However, when stratified by geographic area, the incidence among women showed a decline after 2016 in some areas. Overall, incidence rates were higher in urban than in rural areas, lower in predominantly Muslim than Buddhist areas, and lower in rubber plantation areas compared with other occupational areas. Age was positively associated with skin cancer incidence. The cohort effect demonstrated a decreasing rate ratio (RR) among men born after 1945, while no significant change in RR was observed among women. The period effect showed no significant influence on RR in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of skin cancer in Songkhla, Thailand, has shown a decreasing trend in men and remained stable in women, awareness and prevention should continue to be emphasized, particularly among older individuals who are more prone to UV radiation exposure.</description>

METHODS: A total of 60 systemically healthy, non-smoking individuals were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were divided into three groups based on periodontal examination: healthy (Group H, n = 20), gingivitis (Group G, n = 20), and periodontitis (Group P, n = 20). Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Salivary biomarker levels were analyzed using ELISA. RESULTS: All biomarkers were significantly elevated in groups G and P compared to group H (p &lt; 0.05), and higher in group P than group G (p &lt; 0.05). ROC analysis revealed that galectin-9 (AUC = 0.946) was significantly better at distinguishing periodontal disease than galectin-8 (AUC = 0.832) and RANKL (AUC = 0.780) (p &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed between galectin-8 and RANKL (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Salivary galectin-8, galectin-9, and RANKL levels are elevated in periodontal disease and may serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Among them, galectin-9 demonstrated superior discriminative power for identifying periodontal disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06404476.</description>

Consequently, anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban are often prescribed. With the increasing use of targeted therapies, there is a growing concern about potential drug-drug interactions, as these therapies can affect metabolic enzymes and transporters (i.e., cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein). When used in combination with rivaroxaban, these interactions may elevate a patient's risk of thromboembolic events or bleeding. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of sotorasib on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and determine the safety of this combination in healthy volunteers. In an open label, single-sequence, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, the influence of a once-daily 960 mg dose sotorasib for a period of 14 days was evaluated on the pharmacokinetics of a single 20 mg dose rivaroxaban. This clinical study followed the FDA guidance on drug interaction studies. A clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was considered absent if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUC0-∞ were within the no-effect boundaries of 0.70-1.43. A total of 20 healthy subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios 1.00 (90% CI 0.90-1.12) for Cmax and 0.79 (90% CI 0.73-0.86) for AUC0-∞ fell inside the predefined criteria, indicating no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction. In addition, rivaroxaban and sotorasib were well tolerated by the healthy subjects. These results suggest that rivaroxaban can be safely co-administered without the need for switching to another treatment or dose adjustments in patients treated with sotorasib.</description>

We conducted a scoping review and exploratory meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of OSA following chemoradiation. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies assessing incident OSA after radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Eligible studies isolated the effect of one treatment and reported OSA rates in each group. RESULTS: Of 559 papers identified, 110 were duplicates and 30 underwent full-text review; 13 met criteria for exploratory meta-analysis. A modest, nonsignificant trend toward increased risk of mild OSA was observed with radiotherapy (z = 1.42, p = 0.15). Chemotherapy was not associated with mild (z = -0.83, p = 0.41) or moderate (z = 0.00, p = 1.00) OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Studies are limited in size and number, and do not support increased risk of OSA with radiotherapy.</description>

METHODS: Using 16S rRNA sequencing of saliva from 21 MD-PV patients, 26 LR-MMP patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC), we analyzed microbial diversity, differential taxa (LEfSe), and functional potential (PICRUSt2/BugBase). RESULTS: Both patient groups showed significant microbial restructuring without major richness changes, featuring increased Firmicutes and decreased Proteobacteria. Disease-specific signatures included Flavobacteriia enrichment in MD-PV and Coriobacteriia/Actinobacteria in LR-MMP. Shared metabolic alterations involved "Biosynthesis of amino acids," "Phosphotransferase system," and "Ribosome" pathways, while distinct activations included "all-trans-farnesol biosynthesis" in MD-PV and "peptidoglycan biosynthesis" in LR-MMP. Phenotype prediction revealed increased Gram-positive bacteria and reduced pathogenic and stress-tolerant taxa. Microbial dysbiosis scores positively correlated with clinical disease severity. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies distinct oral microbial dysbiosis patterns in MD-PV and LR-MMP, with conserved functional shifts and disease-specific metabolic adaptations. The microbiota-severity correlation highlights its potential role in disease mechanisms, offering new insights for therapeutic exploration.

METHODS: Fifty-seven TUGSE and 50 non-specific ulcer patients were included. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were screened by PCR for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (hCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). RESULTS: The majority of TUGSE patients were in their sixth (29.8%) and seventh (24.6%) decades of life, with a 1:1.6 male-to-female ratio. The tongue is the most common site (47.4%), followed by buccal mucosa (28.1%). The average duration was 13.5 weeks, and almost one-fourth of the lesions were clinically diagnosed as oral squamous cell carcinoma (24.6%). TUGSE showed a significantly higher propensity to harbor macrophage infiltrates and inflammatory involvement with skeletal muscle fibers or salivary gland tissues, compared to non-specific ulcers. EBV was observed in two TUGSE cases (3.5%) and one patient with a non-specific ulcer (2.0%). Other viral agents were undetectable in TUGSE. CONCLUSION: TUGSE frequently affects the elderly population with a female predilection. The observed low prevalence of viral agents suggests that these pathogens may not play a direct role in TUGSE development.</description>

Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00654-0'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00654-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41554272/'&gt;41554272&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The prognosis for patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas remains poor. Evidence shows that a combination of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapy inhibit tumour growth. We aimed to investigate the dual targeting of VEGF and MET pathways with cabozantinib and temozolomide in patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas. METHODS: This multicentre, single-arm, lead-in phase 2 trial was conducted at five academic Sarcoma Centers of Excellence of the Midwest Sarcoma Trials Partnership in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically-confirmed unresectable or metastatic uterine and non-uterine leiomyosarcoma (cohort 1) and other soft tissue sarcomas (cohort 2; exploratory), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, up to five previous chemotherapy regimens, adequate organ and bone marrow function, and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg (as a starting dose) once per day and temozolomide 150 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle for cycle one. Starting from cycle two, temozolomide was escalated to 200 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of each cycle, if the absolute neutrophil count was more than 1·5 × 109/L and platelet count was more than 100·0 × 109/L, and treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events. The primary endpoint in cohort 1 was progression-free survival at 12 weeks, assessed in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all enrolled patients). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04200443 (completed accrual). FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 6, 2023, 96 patients were assessed for eligibility, 24 were ineligible, and 72 were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 59 years (IQR 52-66) in cohort 1 (n=42) and 63 years (50-69) in cohort 2 (n=30), with a median follow-up of 18·0 months (17·5-20·7). 42 (58%) of 72 patients were female and 30 (42%) were male. In cohort 1, progression-free survival at 12 weeks was reached by 31 (74%) of 42 patients who were still receiving cabozantinib and temozolomide. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival was higher due to censoring and not requiring patients to be receiving treatment at 12 weeks (79·4% [95% CI 68·6-86·8]). 20 (48%) patients in cohort 1 and 23 (77%) in cohort 2 had died due to disease progression at the end of the study. 71 (99%) of 72 patients had grade 1 or higher treatment-related adverse events. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events attributed to either one or both drugs were platelet count decrease (22 [30%]), neutrophil count decrease (13 [18%]), hypertension (seven [10%]), and diarrhoea (six [8%]). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib with temozolomide showed a meaningful clinical benefit and could potentially be a viable treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Treatment was tolerable and did not reveal any new safety signals. FUNDING: Exelixis.</description>

Targeting both the synthesis and clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins is a promising approach. Liver X receptor (LXR) repression can reduce plasma TG and cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing de novo lipogenesis and intestinal lipid absorption and enhancing clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins, but its clinical utility remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate the role of LXR inverse agonists in lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases in preclinical models and humans. Given concerns that systemic LXR repression may impair reverse cholesterol transport, we developed TLC-2716, an orally administered, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist. In human liver organoids modeling steatohepatitis, TLC-2716 reduced lipid accumulation and suppressed inflammation and fibrotic gene expression. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, 14-day treatment with TLC-2716 was well tolerated (primary endpoints) and resulted in placebo-adjusted reductions up to 38.5% in plasma TG and 61% in postprandial remnant cholesterol (secondary endpoints). In conclusion, these results highlight the tolerability and therapeutic potential of TLC-2716 as a treatment for managing dyslipidemia and reducing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in humans.

The differential diagnoses of the observed bony changes, with special attention to the clival alterations, are presented. During the macromorphological, radiological, and digital microscopic examination of MMG3-75, the skull base showed mild cortical erosion and multiple, well-circumscribed osteolytic lesions at the clivus clearly evidenced by 3D imaging. In addition, endocranial granular impressions and abnormal blood vessel impressions were observed in multiple locations on the inner skull surface. Based on the differential diagnosis of the clival changes and their co-occurrence with endocranial alterations indicative of tuberculous meningitis (granular impressions and abnormal blood vessel impressions), they were most likely due to tuberculous involvement of the skull base. Additional aDNA analysis provided no evidence for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in MMG3-75. To the best of our knowledge, MMG3-75 is the first reported archaeological case of tuberculous clival osteomyelitis with associated meningitis, giving us a unique insight into the occurrence of an extremely rare manifestation of tuberculosis in mediaeval Hungary.</description>

More recently, P. gingivalis has been implicated in various systemic conditions, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic and oral cancer. This bacterium employs several mechanisms to evade environmental stress, thereby contributing to its pathogenicity. The viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state is characterized by bacteria that remain viable but have reduced metabolic activity and are unable to form colonies on conventional culture media. To induce the VBNC state in P. gingivalis, we subjected the bacterium to oxidative stress using H2O2 and subsequently resuscitated it from this state with sodium pyruvate. We utilized viability staining, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry (FC) to count live and dead bacteria, confirming the presence of significant numbers of viable P. gingivalis cells both before and after stress induction. Despite being viable, the stressed P. gingivalis failed to form colonies on blood agar plates after seven days of incubation, indicating it had entered the VBNC state. We were then able to resuscitate the VBNC P. gingivalis by adding sodium pyruvate, and the growth of the resuscitated bacteria on plates was comparable to that of control P. gingivalis. Investigation into the invasiveness of P. gingivalis in the VBNC state was conducted using human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). P. gingivalis in the VBNC state demonstrated the ability to invade and based on live/dead staining, showed that a substantial proportion of the VBNC P. gingivalis remained viable within the host cells for extended periods. In this study, we explore the VBNC survival strategy previously described in many aerobic bacteria but not previously reported in anaerobes such as P. gingivalis. The objectives of this study are to verify the VBNC state in P. gingivalis, determine whether this state can be reversed and assess the extent to which it impacts the ability of P. gingivalis to invade host cells. Understanding the VBNC and resuscitation states will be instrumental in guiding the development of more effective therapies for periodontitis and other diseases associated with P. gingivalis infection.</description>

METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 108 individuals aged 14-53 years (median age 18 years; interquartile range 17-26) with a moderate to very great need for surgery according to the Index of Orthognathic Functional Treatment Need were assessed. There were 43% adolescents (≤17 years) and 68% females. Participants completed validated questionnaires measuring personality characteristics (Big Five Inventory, Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, and Self-Esteem Scale), along with the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire. The decision to accept or refuse surgery was recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 51% of patients accepted surgery (48% of females and 57% of males). Adults were more likely to accept surgery than adolescents (61% vs. 37%; p = 0.019, V = 0.241; odds ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.9). In adults, lower self-esteem (SE) (p = 0.034, r = 0.270) and higher perfectionism (p = 0.012; r = 0.320), particularly concern over mistakes (CM) (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.469) and personal standards (p = 0.004; r = 0.370), were associated with acceptance. Among adolescents, personality traits showed no significant effect. However, in both age groups, impaired oral function (OF) (p = 0.013; r = 0.368 for adolescents and p = 0.006; r = 0.348 for adults) and greater facial esthetics concern (FE) (p = 0.018; r = 0.350 and p = 0.015; r = 0.310) influenced surgery acceptance. Males who accepted surgery had higher awareness of deformity than those who refused (p = 0.006; r = 0.463), while females who accepted surgery had lower SE (p = 0.044; r = 0.235). In both males and females FE was higher in those who accepted surgery (p = 0.009; r = 0.439 for males and p = 0.006; r = 0.320 for females), OF (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.597 and p = 0.003; r = 0.342), and CM (p = 0.030; r = 0.367 and p = 0.006; r = 0.325). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between personality traits, QoL, and the decision to undergo orthognathic surgery was more strongly influenced by age than by gender. OF and FE influenced acceptance across all age and gender groups, while personality-related factors were particularly relevant among adults.</description>

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of, and patient behavior associated with chemo-mechanical caries removal versus conventional drilling in children aged 6-12 years. METHODS: A split-mouth randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 66 molar teeth. The effectiveness of Papacarie Duo Gel and conventional drilling methods was assessed using colony-forming unit (CFU) counts before and after each treatment. Cavity preparation time and intraoperative patient behavior using the Frankl Behavior Rating Scale were also evaluated. RESULTS: Both methods resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial counts post-treatment. However, conventional drilling showed a greater percentage reduction in bacterial load (82.9 ± 13.9; t = -4.42, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the chemo-mechanical method (68.6 ± 16.6). The mean caries removal time was 692.4 ± 245.9 sec with the chemo-mechanical method, compared to 266.9 ± 101.6 sec with conventional drilling. In terms of behavior, 57.6% of the children exhibited a positive response during chemo-mechanical treatment whereas negative behavior was more commonly observed with conventional drilling. CONCLUSION: While conventional drilling remains the better-established and time-efficient method of caries removal, the chemo-mechanical technique serves as a valuable alternative for managing children, reducing anxiety and promoting greater comfort and cooperation during treatment.

The therapeutic and preventive effects of glycyrrhizin (GL), a compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties, remain unclear due to the lack of appropriate animal models, especially for prevention studies. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and preventive effects of GL and determine the optimal concentrations using two hamster models (stomatitis-initiation model and stomatitis-healing model) representing the initiation and healing phases of RAS. The effects were evaluated through macroscopic and histological analyses, gene expression profiling in hamster buccal tissues, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assays in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human oral keratinocytes. In the stomatitis-healing model, a low concentration of GL (0.0065%) significantly increased the cure rate and histologically reduced the numbers of vessels and lymphocytes. In the stomatitis-initiation model, low concentrations of GL (0.0065% and 0.033%) significantly decreased the edema score and histologically reduced the numbers of vessels and neutrophils, as well as the mRNA expression levels of interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2. In contrast, a high concentration of GL (0.33%) showed inferior efficacy compared with low concentrations in both models. Similarly, in LPS-stimulated human oral keratinocytes, low GL concentrations suppressed PGE₂ protein expression, while the highest concentration increased it. These findings show that GL promotes healing and prevents the onset of stomatitis at specific concentrations, underscoring the importance of optimal dosing and supporting the potential clinical application of GL in the management of RAS.</description>

We analyzed baseline HR-HPV-positive participants from the control arm of a bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine trial in China, with follow-up over 5.5 years. Cox regression and competing risk models were applied to evaluate the progression, clearance, and persistence of these HR-HPV infections. Among 534 HR-HPV-positive women at baseline, 98 CIN2+ lesions were identified (52 at baseline, 46 during follow-up). HPV-16 and HPV-31 exhibited the highest immediate CIN2+ risk (21.1%), followed by HPV-33 (17.1%) and HPV-58 (12.7%). When stratified by baseline cytology, the LSIL+ group showed the highest immediate risk of CIN2+ (29.5% among the HR-HPV-positive participants), followed by the ASC-US (10.5%). In the longitudinal analysis, competing risk models revealed significant type-specific differences in progression (Gray's test P = 0.0158) and clearance (Gray's test P &lt;0.0001). HPV-16, -31, -18, and -58 showed relatively high progression (27.1%, 19.2%, 16.1%, and 11.2%) and low clearance (72.9%, 69.2%, 83.9%, and 88.8%). CIN2+ risk was strongly genotype-dependent; beyond HPV-16/18, types -31, -33, and -58 also warrant particular attention in screening and clinical management. Additionally, although a slightly higher CIN2+ progression risk was observed in younger women compared to older women, the difference was not statistically significant (Gray's test P = 0.4389), indicating the need for confirmation in larger studies. These findings enhance the understanding of the natural history of type-specific HR-HPV and age-specific progression in initially screen-positive populations.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mandibular first molar typodont model with a chamfer finish line was prepared and scanned ten times, resulting in ten STL files. The finish line for each file was detected using both automatic and semi-automatic methods in two software programs: the CEREC InLab system and Dentbird software. The internal and marginal gaps were measured at four locations: mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual- using the silicone replica technique. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analyses (α = 0.05) were performed to detect statistical differences in the marginal and internal gaps among the groups. RESULTS: The results revealed significant differences in internal and marginal gaps between the automatic methods of the Dentbird software and the CEREC system (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the semi-automatic methods between the two systems (p &gt; 0.05). Although the fits of crowns automatically designed by Dentbird software were inferior to those of the semi-automatic method by Dentbird software and the CEREC In Lab system, the values of all four groups were within the clinically acceptable range (&lt;120 µm). CONCLUSION: The internal and marginal fit of crowns designed using the automatic and semi-automatic modes in Dentbird, a freely available CAD platform, fell within the range of traditional clinical acceptability. Hence, automatically generated crowns may be considered appropriate for immediate provisional applications, the semi-autonomic finishing line detection can be used for long term crowns in clinical practice.</description>

Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00662-X'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00662-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41548565/'&gt;41548565&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Combined targeting of angiogenic and immune pathways is an emerging strategy in clear cell carcinomas arising from the gynaecological tract (CCGCs), given the unique molecular and microenvironmental features of this gynaecological cancer. We aimed to evaluate the preliminary activity and safety of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in patients with recurrent CCGC. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial (LARA) across three tertiary hospitals in Singapore and South Korea. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed CCGC, which had progressed or recurred after at least one previous line of platinum-based chemotherapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1; and no previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients received 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks plus 20 mg oral lenvatinib daily, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in the first 24 weeks of treatment, as per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST; version 1.1), analysed by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04699071) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 26, 2021, and Oct 10, 2023, 30 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 27 (90%) participants received at least one dose of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib. 25 (83%) patients were included in the primary outcome analysis. Median participant age was 52 years (IQR 40-66). Among the 27 patients, 12 (44%) were Chinese, 12 (44%) were Korean, two (7%) were Malay, and one (4%) was Filipino. 24 (89%) patients had primary ovarian clear cell carcinoma; three (11%) had primary endometrial cancer. All tumours had proficient mismatch repair or microsatellite stability. At data cutoff on March 19, 2025, median follow-up was 21middot;0 months (IQR 12middot;5-25middot;2). Ten of 25 patients had confirmed objective response within 24 weeks (objective response rate at 24 weeks 40% [95% CI 21-61]). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (52%) of 27 patients, the most common of which were hypertension (six [22%] patients), decreased platelet count (two [7%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST; two [7%]), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT; two [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in five (19%) patients, the most common of which were immune-related hepatitis in two (7%) patients and decreased platelet count in two (7%) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib showed promising anti-tumour activity and manageable safety in patients with recurrent CCGC, including in patients with disease progression following previous treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy. These findings support further evaluation of this combination in randomised controlled trials.

We conducted a phase II study of erdafitinib, alone or with cetrelimab, in FGFR-altered mUC. METHODS: Adults with mUC and select FGFR alterations who are ineligible for cisplatin were randomly assigned 1:1 in a noncomparative design to once-daily erdafitinib 8 mg (with pharmacodynamically guided uptitration to 9 mg) or erdafitinib 8 mg plus intravenous cetrelimab 240 mg once every 2 weeks at cycles 1-4 and 480 mg once every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were investigator-assessed confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and safety; secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). No statistical hypotheses were tested. RESULTS: At data cutoff, 87 patients were randomly assigned and treated (erdafitinib, n = 43; erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, n = 44). Of 64 patients with PD-L1 expression data, 56 (87.5%) had low levels of PD-L1 expression (combined positive score &lt;10). Median survival follow-up was 14.2 months. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib was 44.2% (95% CI, 29.1 to 60.1) with one complete response (CR); median DOR and median OS were 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to not estimable [NE]) and 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.3 to NE), respectively. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib plus cetrelimab was 54.5% (95% CI, 38.8 to 69.6), with six (13.6%) CRs; median DOR and median OS were 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.8 to NE) and 20.8 months (95% CI, 12.0 to NE), respectively. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83.7% and 68.2% in erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab groups, respectively), stomatitis (69.8% and 56.8%), and dry mouth (37.2% and 56.8%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 46.5% and 45.5% of patients receiving erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, respectively. CONCLUSION: First-line erdafitinib monotherapy and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in cisplatin-ineligible patients with mUC.</description>

Selective RET inhibitors (SRIs) selpercatinib and pralsetinib have transformed outcomes for patients with RET-altered malignancies. Limited knowledge exists on genomic mechanisms of resistance to SRIs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established 'RETgistry,' a global consortium of patients with advanced RET-altered solid tumors who received SRIs and underwent post-progression tissue or plasma biopsies assessed by next-generation sequencing. Frequencies of secondary RET resistance mutations and acquired non-RET gene alterations were determined. Progression-free survival (PFS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) on first SRI were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: RETgistry included 109 patients with RET-altered advanced solid tumors (lung: n=94; thyroid: n=15) who underwent 143 post-SRI progression biopsies (tissue: 91; plasma: 52). Median PFS and TTD were 13.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.1-16.6) and 17.3 months (95% CI 14.0-20.2), respectively. Secondary RET mutations were detected in 20 (14.0%) biopsies (lung cancer: 15 [12.4%], thyroid carcinoma: 5 [22.7%]). Common acquired off-target alterations involved MET (18.2%; amplification: 15.0%), TP53 (8.2%), APC (7.6%), KRAS (7.1%), KEAP1 (5.9%), and CDKN2A/B (5.3%). MET alterations were enriched in post-SRI versus pre-SRI specimens (full cohort: 17.6% vs 2.0%, p=0.022; lung cancer: 19.1% vs 2.1%, p=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of secondary RET mutations after SRIs was low, underscoring greater role for off-target resistance. Recurrent acquired alterations involving tumor suppressor genes or upstream regulators of MAPK and PI3K pathways were identified, most commonly MET amplification. Continued efforts to characterize SRI resistance biology are critical to guide development of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce risks for major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death), and the risk of admission to or treatment within hospital for heart failure. These drugs reduce albuminuria and slow the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate over time, therefore delaying or preventing kidney failure. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, liraglutide and semaglutide) and the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide have been approved for treatment of obesity, with clinical trials establishing benefits for various obesity-related conditions: prevention of type 2 diabetes; risk for major adverse cardiovascular events; heart failure, especially with preserved ejection fraction; regression of steatosis and prevention of fibrosis in steatotic liver disease; and symptomatic improvements in obstructive sleep apnoea and knee osteoarthritis. Current developments include the exploration of novel indications (eg, neurodegenerative diseases and substance use disorders) with suggestive evidence of efficacy, and the development of small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists for oral treatment to improve convenience. Dual (ie, GLP-1-glucagon and GLP-1-amylin) and triple (ie, GIP-GLP-1-glucagon) receptor agonists activating multiple receptors promise greater efficacy than mono-agonists, especially for weight loss. However, some clinical development programmes have a high burden of adverse gastrointestinal events, and dose-escalation regimens should be optimised to reach acceptable tolerability.</description>

The expression, prognostic, single-cell value, immune cell infiltration, and immune check-point (ICI) of TRPV1 in pan-cancer were assessed. Functional assays were performed to evaluate the effect of TRPV1 in vitro. TRPV1 was significantly upregulated in 13 cancers, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, the expression of TRPV1 was significantly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and ICI. Cellular function and western blot experiments revealed that TRPV1 may be required for cancer cell migration in head and neck cancer and lung cancer by inhibition of PI3K/AKT and promotion of immune cell infiltration and autophage. Our study suggests that TRPV1 may be able to regulate the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune-related physiological activities and thereby regulating the occurrence and progression of cancers. Thus, TRPV1 could be used to develop new-targeted drugs for cancers.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lu S, Wang J, Yang N, Lv D, Chen L, Wu L, Li X, Sun L, Yu Y, Jin B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01811-2'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01811-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41544643/'&gt;41544643&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Savolitinib combined with osimertinib is a potential novel therapy for patients with EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbouring MET amplification after progression on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of savolitinib-osimertinib versus standard of care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in this patient population. METHODS: SACHI was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial conducted across 68 Chinese hospitals. Eligible adults with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and MET amplification after EGFR TKI failure were randomly assigned (1:1) to once daily oral savolitinib-osimertinib or intravenous chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin), both in 21-day cycles. Central randomisation was implemented through an interactive web-response system with stratification based on the presence of brain metastases, previous exposure to third-generation EGFR TKIs, and EGFR mutation subtype, using a mixed block-size methodology. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, was tested using a hierarchical procedure: first in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive population, and if positive, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety analysis was performed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. Interim analysis data cutoff was Aug 30, 2024. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05015608) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2021, and Aug 30, 2024, 211 patients were enrolled, 106 were randomly assigned to savolitinib-osimertinib and 105 were randomly assigned to chemotherapy, including 137 (65%) of 211 who were third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (69 in the savolitinib-osimertinib group; 68 in the chemotherapy group). In 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group, the median age was 59·4 years (IQR 54·3-65·8), 62 (58%) were female, and 44 (42%) were male. In 105 patients in the chemotherapy group, the median age was 61·9 years (IQR 56·3-69·1), 55 (52%) were female, and 50 (48%) were male. All participants were Asian. Median PFS was significantly prolonged with savolitinib-osimertinib versus chemotherapy in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (9·8 months [95% CI 6·9-12·5] vs 5·4 months [4·2-6·0]; hazard ratio 0·34 [0·21-0·56]; p&lt;0·0001) and ITT populations (8·2 months [6·9-11·2] vs 4·5 months [3·0-5·4]; 0·34 [0·23-0·49]; p&lt;0·0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the same proportion of patients in both groups who received the study drugs (60 [57%] of 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group and 55 [57%] of 96 patients in the chemotherapy group). INTERPRETATION: The savolitinib-osimertinib combination improved PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, MET-amplified NSCLC that had progressed on EGFR TKI therapy, while maintaining a favourable tolerability profile. This regimen offers a potential oral treatment option for this biomarker-selected population. FUNDING: HUTCHMED and AstraZeneca.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kirmani N, De León-Fernández N, Rodriguez-Parra JD, Ghanem L, Hakkeem B, Briceño-Morales C, Briceño-Morales X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer treatment reviews | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2026.103093'&gt;10.1016/j.ctrv.2026.103093&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41539087/'&gt;41539087&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Endocrine therapy (ET) plus CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) remains first-line (1 L) standard for ER+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer (mBC). However, ESR1 mutations lead to ET resistance and subsequent disease progression (PD). Limitations of intramuscular fulvestrant have led to the development of novel oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). We aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of novel oral SERDs for ER+/HER2- mBC. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral SERDs with standard treatment. Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) overall and by subgroups (ESR1 mutation, menopausal status, age, prior CDK4/6i use, visceral metastases), PFS comparing oral SERDs versus fulvestrant in ESR1-mutated patients, and grade ≥ 3 or discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Hazard and risk ratios (HRs/RRs) were pooled using random-effects models (RStudio 2025.09.2 + 418). RESULTS: Eight RCTs (n = 3,978) were included. Overall, PFS did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.80; 95 % CI 0.62-1.04; p = 0.09). Statistically significant PFS subgroups included: ESR1 mutation (HR 0.57; 95 % CI 0.45-0.73; p &lt; 0.01); prior CDK4/6i use (HR 0.68; 95 % CI 0.49-0.95; p = 0.03); visceral metastases (HR 0.78; 95 % CI 0.63-0.97; p = 0.03); age &lt; 65 years (HR 0.75; 95 % CI 0.60-0.92; p = 0.01); and oral SERDs versus fulvestrant (HR 0.55; 95 % CI 0.46-0.66; p &lt; 0.01). Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were higher with SERDs (RR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.07-2.50; p = 0.03), while treatment discontinuation was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Novel oral SERDs may represent a paradigm shift in managing PD after 1 L therapy, showing potential to improve PFS in selected patients.</description>

While generally considered indolent, limited case reports suggest their potential for regional metastasis. This retrospective study analyzed the clinical, demographic, and pathological features of 25 adult patients diagnosed with ganglioneuroma at Bursa Uludag University, Faculty of Medicine, between April 2007 and November 2023. The cohort comprised 18 females (72%) and seven males (28%), with a median age of 42 years (range: 19-79). Tumors were most commonly located in the abdomen (64%), followed by the thoracic (24%) and head and neck regions (12%), with the adrenal gland being the primary site in 32% of cases. Symptoms were present in 56% of patients, including pain, vision loss, hypertension, and palpable masses, while the remaining were asymptomatic. Surgical resection was performed in 92% of cases, with a median tumor size of 7.5 cm (1.5-18 cm). Median follow-up time was 88.3(16.2 - 217.8) months. Regional lymph node metastases were identified in 8% of patients, but no distant metastases or recurrences were observed during follow-up. These findings, including the novel observation of regional metastases, contribute valuable insights to the limited literature on ganglioneuromas. Despite its benign nature, this study highlights the potential for lymph node metastasis. However, the relationship between lymph node metastasis and recurrence has not been documented. In this context, further research is essential to better understand the risk factors, tumorigenesis, and the optimal management strategies for this rare tumor.</description>

Despite advances in radiation techniques and surgical management, reliable predictors of ORN prognosis remain lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between systemic inflammatory biomarkers and ORN prognosis. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study included patients with ORN treated between January 2010 and March 2022 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. Patients with unavailable blood test data were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variables were pretreatment systemic inflammatory biomarkers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). The cutoff values for NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and LMR were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Each marker was calculated at the time of diagnosis of ORN. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome variable was prognosis. Subjects had a good prognosis if the ORN stage improved. The prognosis was poor if the ORN stage was stable or worse over time. COVARIATES: Sex, age, stage, onset region, primary tumor site, radiation dose, smoking history, medical history, steroid therapy, clinical symptoms, treatment methods, and computed tomography image findings were covariates. ANALYSES: Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test, Fisher's exact test, χ2 test, and Cox regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 75 subjects, of whom 16 (21.3%) had a poor prognosis. The median follow-up period was 88 (53 to 122) months. Bivariate analysis revealed that high NLR (P &lt; .01) and low LMR (P = .02) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, poor prognosis was significantly associated with advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 5.33; 95% CI, 1.61 to 17.65; P &lt; .01), ORN stage 3, 4 (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.56; P &lt; .01), high NLR (HR, 14.78; 95% CI, 3.50 to 62.35; P &lt; .01), and periosteal reaction (HR, 19.15; 95% CI, 4.65 to 78.87; P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified high NLR as a risk factor for poor prognosis in ORN. High NLR is considered to reflect worse local tissue and systemic health.</description>

Nonetheless, the safety profiles of various immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combination therapies remain inadequately characterized, particularly regarding the incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The research employed a network meta-analysis to systematically evaluate and contrast the toxicity profiles across various initial ICI-driven treatments for advanced Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: An extensive literature review was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify RCTs evaluating first-line immunotherapy in advanced ESCC. The search included all records from each database's inception to July 1, 2025. Primary endpoints included grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events(grade ≥3 trAEs), any-grade irAEs, and grade ≥3 irAEs. Secondary analyses focused on organ-specific irAEs, including immune-mediated rash, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and pneumonitis. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to assess relative risks (RRs) and establish a treatment ranking based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) metrics, evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different therapeutic options. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251113069). RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 4,479 patients with advanced ESCC were included. In pairwise meta-analyses, ICI plus chemotherapy, compared with chemotherapy alone, increased the risk of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17), any-grade irAEs (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.71-2.44), and grade ≥3 irAEs (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.98-3.82). Immune-chemotherapy also significantly elevated the risks of immune-mediated rash, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, whereas the increase in immune-mediated pneumonitis did not reach statistical significance. In Bayesian network meta-analyses, camrelizumab plus chemotherapy had the highest probability of being the regimen with the lowest risk of grade ≥3 trAEs(SCURA = 87.8%) and grade ≥3 irAEs(SCURA = 71.6%), while toripalimab plus chemotherapy ranked safest for any-grade irAEs(SCURA = 83.8%). CONCLUSIONS: First-line ICI-based regimens for advanced ESCC are associated with an increased risk of severe treatment-related and immune-related toxicities compared with chemotherapy alone, and their safety profiles differ substantially across regimens. Our SUCRA-based rankings provide a comparative overview of regimen-level toxicity that may assist clinicians in understanding relative safety trade-offs when selecting first-line therapy. These findings should be integrated with regimen-specific efficacy data, regulatory indications, PD-L1 status, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and are best interpreted as complementary safety evidence rather than stand-alone treatment recommendations.

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 208 patients with VCFs treated at our institution between January 2020 and November 2024. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 145) and a validation cohort (n = 63). CT images were obtained, and three-dimensional lesion regions were manually segmented. A total of 1,316 radiomics features were extracted. Dimensionality reduction was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and 5-fold cross-validation to identify key features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for identifying independent clinical predictors. Three models were constructed: a clinical model, a radiomics model, and a combined clinical-radiomics model. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Predictive efficacy and clinical utility were further assessed via ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA), along with clinical impact curves (CIC) and net reduction curves. The Delong test was used for statistical comparisons among different models, and a nomogram was developed to facilitate the visualization of the optimal model. RESULTS: Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and posterior vertebral involvement were identified as independent clinical predictors. The combined model achieved the highest AUC value of 0.846 in the validation cohort, followed by the radiomics model (0.842), and the clinical model (0.640). Calibration curves and DCA confirmed its superior predictive accuracy and clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based clinical-radiomics model demonstrated robust performance in differentiating benign from malignant VCFs and holds promise for guiding individualized patient management.</description>

While its role in general RNA regulation is established, its contribution to the HPV-dependent transcriptome and splicing stratification in cervical cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine how SRPK1 inhibition differentially remodels gene expression and alternative splicing in HPV+ versus HPV- cervical cancer cells. METHODS: HPV16+ SiHa and HPV- C33A cervical cancer cells were treated with the SRPK1 inhibitor, SPHINX31. RNA profiling was performed, and differentially expressed genes were defined as |log2FC| ≥ 1.5. AS events were classified by SUPPA as exon skipping (SE), intron retention (RI), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 3' splice site (A3SS), and alternative 5' splice site (A5SS). Pathway enrichment was assessed using Gene Ontology/KEGG, STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to identify protein hubs. To determine computational prediction of docking, SPHINX31 was docked into SRPK1 (PDB 5MY8) using SP/XP docking and MM-GBSA rescoring. RESULTS: SRPK1 inhibition was associated with distinct responses that were HPV-related. In C33A cells, upregulated genes were enriched for translation, RNA processing, and glycosylation, with KEGG highlighting ribosome and metabolic modules. Ribosomal hubs dominated the PPI/MCODE, suggesting possible translational and metabolic adjustments. In contrast, SiHa cells exhibited transcriptomic changes consistent with reduced expression of genes linked to Hippo, Wnt, PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2 signaling, migration, angiogenesis, and growth factor cytokine networks. Targets of YAP/TAZ (e.g., CCND1, BIRC5, SNAI2, SERPINE1) and their regulators (RASSF1, CSNK1E) were suppressed. At the splicing level, SiHa cells displayed fewer total AS events but with larger effect sizes, particularly in A3SS/A5SS. C33A cells showed abundant SE (59,234 events; small median ΔPSI) and RI (1,770 events, often binary), including complete shifts in HLA-DRB1/PLIN2 (+1.00) and KLF4 (-1.00). Notable A5SS switches included LEF1 (+1.00) and CDK6 (-1.00) in C33A, and DLX1/MRPL14/THAP5 (-1.00) in SiHa. Docking computationally predicted the low-energy poses of SPHINX31 in the SRPK1 ATP pocket. While not definitive, this evidence may potentially support the transcriptomic and splicing findings. CONCLUSION: SRPK1 inhibition may remodel the cervical cancer transcriptome in an HPV-linked manner, with SiHa cells exhibiting changes consistent with suppression of oncogenic signaling, whereas C33A cells adapt through translational and metabolic reprogramming.</description>

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of berberine in reducing VAT area and liver fat content in diabetes-free individuals with obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial, diabetes-free individuals with obesity and MASLD were enrolled at 11 hospitals in China between July 6 and December 29, 2023, with a follow-up duration of 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either oral berberine, 1 g/d, or a matching placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were relative percentage change in VAT area and absolute change in liver fat content assessed by computed tomography. Other outcomes included changes in parameters of glucose, lipids, and inflammation. Analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Among 337 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 41.8 [10.6] years; 221 [65.6%] male), 169 received berberine and 168 placebo. The mean (SD) medication adherence rates were 90.3% (14.7%) for berberine and 90.7% (17.4%) for placebo. No significant differences were observed between study arms for VAT area (1.4% [97.5% CI, -2.4% to 5.2%]) or liver fat content (0.9% [97.5% CI, -0.4% to 2.1%). Berberine was associated with larger reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.72 [95% CI, -13.13 to -1.93] mg/dL), apolipoprotein B (-3.42 [95% CI, -6.33 to -0.51] mg/dL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-0.072 [95% CI, -0.140 to -0.004] mg/dL) vs placebo, but not other secondary outcomes. The incidence of adverse events was similar between study arms. Post hoc analyses suggested consistent patterns of larger reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and hs-CRP levels in participants with higher baseline hs-CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of diabetes-free individuals with obesity and MASLD, a 6-month berberine treatment at a daily dose of 1 g had an excellent safety profile but did not reduce VAT area or liver fat content.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zahirova N, Tillyashaykhov M, Egamberdiev D, Lucas E, Rol M, Inoyatova N, Akhmedova M, Olkov I, Muwonge R, Basu P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JCO global oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/GO-25-00250'&gt;10.1200/GO-25-00250&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41538754/'&gt;41538754&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: In 2021, Ministry of Health conducted a pilot study to screen 50,000 women with human papillomavirus (HPV) testing in Uzbekistan and assess the feasibility of national implementation. The present article describes organization of the pilot, evaluation of the program using key performance indicators (KPIs), and lessons learned. METHODS: Women age 30-55 years were invited for HPV screening via a communication campaign at 11 polyclinics in Karakalpakstan province. Samples were collected and analyzed locally in nine polyclinics using GeneXpert test. HPV-positive women were triaged with colposcopy, although colposcopists were not trained to obtain biopsies or perform treatment. Abnormal results led to further diagnostic colposcopy and treatment. Pilot data were managed using an Excel database, with quality assurance through regular monitoring visits and estimation of KPIs. RESULTS: Over 10 months, 50,000 women were tested for HPV, with 98% yielding satisfactory results and a 6.8% positivity rate. Of the HPV-positive women, 93.9% underwent triaging colposcopy, revealing abnormalities in 32.5%, although results varied by district. Diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology data were available for 87.9% of referrals. Treatment adherence was not systematically tracked. An external review showed 64.6% agreement with local histopathology, and the correlation between diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology was 53.2%. CONCLUSION: The pilot successfully recruited a large number of women and ensured high participation of the HPV-positive women in triage and diagnostic evaluation. Key strengths were the use of existing health infrastructure, and decentralization of services. However, challenges were identified in HPV test procurement, referral pathways, quality of pathology and colposcopy, and adequate data collection. Addressing these issues is critical to the future success of cervical cancer screening in Uzbekistan.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Oko-Oboh AG, Auvinen A, Obaseki DE, Pitkäniemi J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JCO global oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/GO-25-00318'&gt;10.1200/GO-25-00318&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41538752/'&gt;41538752&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Cancer burden in sub-Saharan Africa is high, driven by infections and behavioral risks. Nigeria had Africa's second-highest number of new cancers in 2022. This study estimated the proportion of new cancers attributable to alcohol, tobacco, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Edo State, Nigeria. METHODS: We analyzed cancer incidence data from the Edo-Benin Cancer Registry (EBCR; 2009-2018) for cancer sites associated with alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and HPV infection, as outlined in the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monographs. For each site, we calculated the number of attributable cancers and the population attributable fraction for the three exposures by sex, using country-specific exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates from previous research. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, the EBCR reported 4,937 cancer cases (2,069 men [41.9%] and 2,868 women [58.1%]). Nine alcohol-associated sites accounted for 30.1% of all cases (12.3% in men and 43% in women), 13 tobacco-related sites accounted for 27.5% (18.4% in men and 34.1% in women), and six HPV-related sites accounted for 15.2% (4% in men and 34.1% in women). Of alcohol-associated cancers (n = 1,488), 25.6% (381/1,488) were attributable to alcohol use; 5.3% (72/1,359) of smoking-related cancers were attributable to tobacco use, and high-risk HPV genotypes were estimated to cause 77.5% (581/750) of HPV-related cancers. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that nearly three fourths of HPV- and about one fourth of alcohol-associated cancers could be prevented through targeted and evidence-based interventions in Edo State, Nigeria. These findings highlight the need for strengthening both individual and policy-level prevention efforts, prioritizing high-impact risk factors to achieve measurable reductions in cancer burden.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: CBCT images from 287 patients were retrospectively reviewed. STCOs were identified in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, with segmentation performed in the axial plane. The AI model was trained to detect arterial calcifications, phleboliths, tonsilloliths, styloid ligament ossification, osteoma cutis, antroliths, laryngeal cartilage calcifications, sialoliths, lymph node calcifications, and rhinoliths as well as a single combined class. Data were split into training (80%), testing (10%), and validation (10%) sets, and performance was evaluated using sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. RESULTS: In the single-class model, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score were 0.98, 0.91, and 0.94, respectively. In the multi-class model, these values were 0.88, 0.80, and 0.84. CONCLUSION: The AI system achieved high accuracy in detecting STCOs, with superior results in single-class classification. AI-assisted CBCT evaluation may improve diagnostic efficiency, facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration, and support clinical decision-making.</description>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral mucosa state by defining the occurrence of oral lesions and Candida carriage in DH patients. DESIGN: Thirty DH patients underwent oral mucosa examination and mycologic evaluation. RESULTS: The most common complaints included gum bleeding and pain (10 patients, 33.3%), pain due to oral ulceration (8 patients, 26.6%), a burning sensation and taste disturbances (5 patients, 16.6%), and xerostomia (4 patients, 13.3% each). The most common findings on the oral mucosa included white-coated tongue (16 persons; 53.3%) and buccal mucosa edema (15 patients; 23.3%). Linea alba was observed in 11 persons (30%). Tongue depapillation and atrophic-erythematous tongue lesions were revealed in 5 (16.6%) and 4 persons (13.3%), respectively. Candidiasis was found in 12 DH patients (40%). Systemic conditions that most commonly accompanied DH included anemia- 14 patients (46.6%), hypertension- 7 patients (23.3%), allergies- 6 patients (20%), and other gastrointestinal diseases unrelated to DH- 5 patients (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS: DH may promote the occurrence of a white-coated tongue, mucosal edema, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis, and may increase the risk of oral candidiasis.</description>

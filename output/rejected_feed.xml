      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Schermerhorn SMV, Vore E, Bondoc AJ, Lautz TB, Ayala SA, Kastenberg ZJ, Arkin C, Malek MM, Campwala I, Aldrink JH, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70274'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70274&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41653066/'&gt;41653066&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a critical staging tool in skin and soft tissue cancers. Although technetium lymphoscintigraphy is the most common adjunct, indocyanine green (ICG) demonstrates a promising alternative in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) skin and soft tissue cancers. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICG in SLN biopsy (SLNB) in diverse pediatric and AYA solid cancers in a multi-institutional environment. This is a prospective, observational study conducted at 13 member institutions in the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative between 2019 and 2023. Eligible patients underwent SLNB for primary or recurrent solid skin and soft tissue tumors. Peritumoral ICG was administered intraoperatively. Outcomes included SLN detection rates, histopathology of excised specimens, and surgeon-reported assessment of utility. Safety was assessed through adverse event reporting. RESULTS: Forty SLNB procedures yielded 84 specimens: 13 melanoma (32.5%), 12 squamous cell carcinoma (30%), 11 non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (27.5%), two rhabdomyosarcoma (5%), one Ewing sarcoma (2.5%), and one malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2.5%). Histologic evaluation identified 81 lymph nodes, 75 benign (89.3%) and six malignant (7.1%); three specimens were adipose tissue (3.6%). Of 81 lymph nodes, 76% were ICG-positive. ICG had a sensitivity of 79.5%, a specificity of 33%, and a positive predictive value of 96%. All malignant nodes were ICG-avid. There were no adverse reactions to ICG at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: ICG is a safe and effective adjunct for SLNB in pediatric and AYA soft tissue and skin malignancies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Scotta MC, Polese-Bonatto M, Varela FH, Sartor ITS, Zavaglia GO, de David CN, Fernandes IR, Azevedo TR, Barros A, Carvalho ACC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0342753'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0342753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41678529/'&gt;41678529&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The burden of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) among children and adolescents is often underestimated due to challenges in obtaining lower respiratory tract samples, nonspecific signs and symptoms, the paucibacillary nature of tuberculosis (TB), and the low yield of microbiological tests. Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in induced sputum (IS) samples is the most promising test for improving microbiologic diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in young children. We describe the TBPed Brazil study, a multicenter, cross-sectional study in participants aged 6 months to 15 years. We designed a two-arm study: a hospital-based arm with patients hospitalized with LRTI and an outpatient-based arm with children and adolescents referred to TB-specialized clinics. The main aim in the hospital-based arm is to determine the prevalence of PTB. In the outpatient-based arm, the main objective is to determine the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in IS samples compared to liquid culture. We evaluate in both arms: tuberculosis infection (TBI) prevalence, the accuracy of tongue swabs compared to liquid culture and clinical diagnosis, the risk factors associated with PTB or TBI; the accuracy of the Brazilian Ministry of Health scoring system for the diagnosis of PTB. In the hospital-based arm, we also evaluate the prevalence of viral and/or bacterial pathogens associated with LRTI. The sample size is 1,848 participants (1,118 hospitalized and 730 outpatients). Enrollment began in December 2021 and is expected to conclude in 2026, involving 27 study sites across Brazil. This is the first prospective nationwide investigation into the prevalence of PTB and TBI, as well as diagnostic accuracy across different methods, in children and adolescents in a large country with a significant TB burden. Study results will provide critical data on epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic approaches to MTB and other respiratory pathogens in children in Brazil, guiding future studies and public health policies.</description>

Nevertheless, approximately 20% of patients discontinue treatment within the first year. In Italy, data on DOAC discontinuation rates are limited, especially in high-risk populations. RITMUS-AF, a prospective, observational cohort study conducted in 31 centers across Italy, investigated rivaroxaban treatment discontinuation in patients with NVAF in routine clinical practice. It included 805 patients aged ≥18 years with NVAF who were newly initiated on rivaroxaban. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment during a 24-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included the reasons for discontinuation and self-reported adherence to rivaroxaban therapy. At baseline, most patients were oral anticoagulant (OAC)-naïve (n = 599, 74.4%) and had either symptomatic (n = 364, 45.2%) or asymptomatic (n = 441, 54.8%) NVAF. The overall rate of rivaroxaban discontinuation was 8.9 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 7.1-11.0). The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events or physician decisions. After 24 months, high adherence was reported in 90.9% of OAC-non-naïve patients and 61.5% of OAC-naïve patients. Forty-six patients (5.7%) experienced bleeding events (with major bleeding events occurring in &lt;0.5% of cases), and one patient (0.1%) had an ischemic stroke. In the RITMUS-AF study, rivaroxaban treatment was associated with a low treatment discontinuation rate, along with high self-reported adherence and a relatively low incidence of ischemic stroke and bleeding events in a high-risk population, findings that may help inform clinical decision-making on the use of rivaroxaban in routine practice.</description>

Mucormycosis manifests in several clinical forms, including sino-orbital, rhinocerebral, sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, osteoarticular, and disseminated mucormycosis, as well as single-organ disease. Although mucormycosis is often lethal, early intervention reduces mortality. Successful treatment depends on early detection and staging of the disease, timely initiation of antifungal therapy, surgical resection of infected tissue, reversal of immunodeficiencies, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. Liposomal amphotericin B is the preferred agent for initial antifungal therapy, with oral triazoles as alternative agents. Research on rapid molecular diagnostic strategies, new antifungal agents, host-directed immune augmentation, antivirulence immune therapeutics, and risk-based stratification to inform management of disease may substantially improve outcomes in patients with this highly destructive mycosis.</description>

This study evaluated the effect of a web-based educational intervention, grounded in the Health Belief Model (HBM), on caries-preventive oral health behaviors in pregnant women. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, 66 pregnant women in Bushehr, Iran, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received a multimedia web-based education program based on HBM constructs, while the control group received routine care. Data on knowledge, HBM constructs, and preventive behaviors were collected before and three months after the intervention using validated questionnaires. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA to compare changes over time between groups. RESULTS: Post-intervention, the intervention group showed significant improvements in knowledge and most HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy) compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Although preventive oral health behaviors increased significantly within the intervention group (p = 0.022), between-group differences in behavior change were not statistically significant (p = 0.171). CONCLUSION: The web-based educational program effectively enhanced pregnant women's knowledge and health beliefs regarding oral health but did not produce a statistically significant improvement in preventive behaviors compared to routine care. Integrating HBM-based web education offers a flexible, cost-effective approach to promote oral health awareness during pregnancy, though further strategies may be needed to translate knowledge gains into sustained behavioral change.</description>

Non-small cell lung cancer is the predominant subtype, constituting the majority of lung cancer cases. Therefore, exploring novel biomarkers is crucial for betterment of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. METHODS: The meta-analysis was performed using GEO datasets, to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. We explored the ChEA database to extract the relevant transcription factors regulating the expression of our hub genes. Further, based on the highest degree of centrality, the feed-forward loop was identified with highest sub-network motif comprising of gene-TF-miRNA. We used pathway and GO term enrichment analysis to determine the importance of these DEGs in different biological processes. RESULTS: In NSCLC, we found 950 differentially expressed miRNAs and 1761 genes were recognized exhibiting the significant change in expression (p &lt; 0.05). Further, we investigated the role of sub-network motif in patient survival, hsa-miR-5010 was found to be significantly linked with patient outcome in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (p = 0.033) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) (p = 0.013) while SMAD4 (p &lt; 0.001) and NRG1 (p &lt; 0.001) expression exhibited prognostic significance in LUAD cohort only. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that NRG1-SMAD4-miR-5010-5p was the most prominent sub-network motif engaged in NSCLC patients based on the degree of centrality. In vitro mechanistic studies will provide better understanding on the role of NRG1-SMAD4-miR-5010-5p motif in NSCLC cases.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; D'Onofrio G, Herring AA, Hawk KF, Perrone J, Cowan E, McCormack RP, Dziura J, Matthews AG, Pantalon MV, Owens P, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.27019'&gt;10.1001/jama.2025.27019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41670966/'&gt;41670966&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Extended-release injectable buprenorphine may expand the reach of initiating medications for opioid use disorder in high-risk and hard-to-reach individuals who visit the emergency department (ED) and can be administered in low levels of withdrawal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of ED-initiated 7-day extended-release injectable buprenorphine vs sublingual buprenorphine on treatment engagement at 7 days. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling adult patients presenting to the ED with untreated opioid use disorder and a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 4 or higher across 29 EDs in the US from July 12, 2020, to August 21, 2024. Final follow-up was completed on October 24, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive a 24-mg injection of extended-release buprenorphine (equivalent to 16 mg/d) or sublingual buprenorphine, which included either self-administration instructions if the COWS score was less than 8 or administration of 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine in the ED if the COWS score was 8 or higher. All sublingual buprenorphine group patients received a 7-day prescription for 16 mg/d. Both groups were provided referral for ongoing medication with a scheduled appointment within 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Engagement in opioid use disorder treatment on day 7 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included engagement at 30 days, precipitated withdrawal and overdose events, craving scores, days of illicit opioid use, and patient satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Among 2000 patients randomized, 6 who were enrolled twice were excluded, resulting in 991 in the extended-release group and 1003 in the sublingual group. The median age was 37 (IQR, 30-47) years, 68% were male, 31% had an initial COWS score of 4 to 7, and 76% tested positive for fentanyl. The adjusted proportion of engagement in opioid use disorder treatment at 7 days was 40.5% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 38.5% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 6.0%). Engagement at 30 days was similar, with adjusted proportions of 43.8% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 44.9% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -6.2% to 3.2%). Precipitated withdrawal was rare: 6 (0.6%) with extended-release buprenorphine and 8 (0.8%) with sublingual buprenorphine. Overdose events within 30 days occurred in 18 participants (2.3%) in each group. Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No difference was detected in opioid use disorder treatment engagement on day 7 between the 7-day extended-release and sublingual buprenorphine groups. Both buprenorphine formulations were well tolerated; precipitated withdrawal was rare despite a high prevalence of fentanyl.

METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched from October 1st, 1990 to January 6th, 2025 for studies reporting bony union for maxilla or mandible reconstruction with vascularized free flap. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 5985 abstracts and 52 were included in the review. Definitions of bony nonunion varied and were reported in 20 studies. Higher pooled rates of complete union were observed in reconstructions of the maxilla, reconstructions using the radius, and surgeries aided by virtual surgical planning. Treatment for nonunion was reported in 11 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual surgical planning has the potential to improve union outcomes and reduce the need for revision surgeries in nonunion cases. The heterogeneity of the studies necessitates randomized controlled trials for further analysis of the nonunion risk factors and consequences.</description>

Here, we report the discovery of a series of ZIKV NS3 protease inhibitors identified through phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) using a ZIKV replicon-based cellular assay, and the subsequent selection of resistant mutants. These inhibitors, characterized by the presence of an N-acylsydnone imine group, bind to a previously undescribed allosteric pocket of the protease, locking the enzyme into a catalytically inactive conformation. We describe the characterization of IRBM-Z-1, our initial allosteric hit and IRBM-Z-2, a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infectivity and other orthoflavivirus proteases with a favourable in vitro and in vivo ADME profile, resulting in oral efficacy against ZIKV infection in mouse models, with potential as a prophylactic agent for human use.</description>

This study proposes a linearly coupled two-compartment PK model, where the coupling term is defined as a linear function of another drug's amount to strike a balance between model simplicity and physiological interpretability. The model introduces parameter heterogeneity and linear interaction terms based on the classical compartmental structure, more accurately capturing concentration-dependent dynamic changes during combined drug administration. To address the model's nonlinear characteristics and high-dimensional parameters, a hierarchical optimization numerical solution algorithm was developed, enhancing computational efficiency while validating robustness against Gaussian noise. Through systematic analysis of key PK metrics ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], AUC, and [Formula: see text]), the study reveals the mechanisms by which absorption and clearance parameter variations influence drug distribution in vivo. Combining numerical simulations, parameter ablation experiments, and real-world data validation, the full model (retaining all linear interaction terms) outperforms the simplified model in both goodness-of-fit and information criteria, demonstrating superior interpretability and predictive performance. Overall, this model offers an intermediate solution between traditional compartmental models and PBPK models, providing a novel methodological framework for quantitative research on drug-drug interactions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Renne A, Heaton J, Boahene KD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70417'&gt;10.1002/lary.70417&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41665481/'&gt;41665481&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Conventional grading scales and static image assessments may not capture dynamic facial movement in facial paralysis. We developed a video-based, dynamic, artificial intelligence (AI) application, DynaFace, to objectively quantify facial metrics and determine which measures correspond with patient-reported appearance, function, and psychosocial outcomes, providing insight into how objective dynamics relate to subjective patient experience. METHODS: DynaFace automatically extracted dynamic facial metrics (facial asymmetry index [FAI], bilateral palpebral fissure, and oral commissure excursion [OCE]) at rest and during smile, laughter, and pucker. Multivariable linear regression, controlling for paralysis duration and baseline trait emotional intelligence, assessed associations between objective metrics and patient-reported outcomes from FACE-Q subsets. RESULTS: Greater asymmetry (higher FAI) during smile and laugh was associated with poorer perceived facial (β = smile: -2.82/laugh: -3.01, p &lt; 0.05), eye (β = -3.99/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05), and smile appearance (β = -4.40/-4.80, p &lt; 0.01), as well as lower overall facial function (β = -3.05/-3.60, p &lt; 0.05) and self-esteem (β = -2.93/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, greater ratio of OCE change (affected to unaffected hemiface) during smile predicted better perceived facial appearance (β = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01), smile appearance (β = 0.69, p &lt; 0.05), and higher self-esteem (β = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05). Greater ratio of OCE change during both smile and laugh predicted improved social function (β = 0.48/0.44, p &lt; 0.05). Palpebral fissure asymmetry was associated with only eye appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic AI-derived facial metrics from DynaFace align with patient perceptions, showing that greater symmetry in movement enhance satisfaction and function. These findings highlight the clinical potential of DynaFace to bridge objective and patient-reported measures in facial paralysis assessment.</description>

The present study was aimed to develop a Flow cytometry- based Florescence In situ hybridization (Flow-FISH) assay for simultaneous detection of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts at single-cell level. A set of 48 STAT3 multi locus probes and 18 HPV16 E6E7 probes were designed using Stellaris Probe Designer. Fluorescence microscopy using these probe sets generated discrete punctate signals for both individual and simultaneous hybridizations, enabling accurate transcript identification. Flow-cytometry analysis showed quantifiable STAT3 expression across CaCx cell lines, namely HeLa, SiHa and C33a. However, HPV16 E6E7 probes showed non-specific binding, which was addressed by redesigning the probes with increased stringency. The specificity of both probe sets was then evaluated through extensive sequence alignment against all known STAT3 transcript variants (n = 27) and 98 HPV16 isolates. The redesigned phase 2 HPV16 E6E7 probes were subsequently tested in cell lines, demonstrating robust detection in HPV16-positive SiHa and CaSki cells and complete absence of signal in HPV-negative controls (C33a, MSB1, SF21) or HPV18-positive HeLa cells. Dual-color flow cytometry enabled simultaneous quantification of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts in both cell lines and patient's exfoliated samples. Increased dual-positive fractions across LSIL, HSIL, and SCC samples were detected that corresponded with progressive viral oncogene activity and STAT3 co-activation. Overall, the optimized probe-based Flow-FISH assay provided a sensitive, specific, and high-throughput method for transcript-level diagnostics, with potential utility for stratifying cervical lesions.</description>

Understanding HDAC activation mechanisms is crucial to treating diverse diseases beyond cancer. Our study reveals that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6 or phytic acid), enriched in vegan diets, play essential roles in activating the HDAC3 epigenetic axis and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. IPMK binds to HDAC3 and drives InsP6 synthesis, which selectively activates HDAC3 at a 10 nM concentration by recruiting the DAD domain of its corepressor protein. IPMK deletion diminishes HDAC3 activation, leading to histone hyperacetylation and MMP gene transcription that compromise intestinal barrier integrity. InsP6 treatment is sufficient to rescue these effects. In inflammatory bowel disease, diminished IPMK levels exacerbate intestinal permeability, while oral InsP6 treatment mitigates leaky gut effects by restoring the HDAC3 epigenetic axis, highlighting the clinical significance of the IPMK-HDAC3 pathway and the therapeutic potential of phytic acid.</description>

Automatic approaches exist but lack generalizability due to signal variability across centers. We develop an automatic apneic breathing event detector to localize and classify obstructive apneas, central apneas, hypopneas, and isolated respiratory events without arousals or desaturations. The model is trained on 5456 polysomnographies and tested on 1099 polysomnographies from six cohorts uses an end-to-end deep learning architecture. The model's predictions show a strong correlation with expert annotations for apnea-hypopnea index (r² = 0.84) and achieve an F1 score of 0.78 across apnea event types, with specific F1 scores of 0.71, 0.51, and 0.65 for obstructive apnea, central apnea, and hypopnea events, respectively. In two independent, multi-scored datasets, The model performs comparably or better than individual expert raters. The model's probabilistic output, termed "apnotyping," provides insights into sleep disordered breathing etiology, with event probabilities correlating more strongly with key sleep apnea traits-such as loop gain and pharyngeal muscle compensation-than traditional apnea indexes. This probabilistic approach may enhance diagnostic accuracy and support personalized treatment strategies, leading to improved patient outcomes.</description>

Global and national strategies highlight the importance of assessing and improving nursing competence. Despite the critical role of nurses, research on self-reported nursing competence (SRNC) in Jordan remains limited. AIM: This study explores self-reported nursing competence (SRNC) among registered nurses (RNs) in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 212 RNs from public, private, and teaching hospitals. Data were collected using the short form of the Nursing Professional Competence (NPC) scale, a 35-item instrument scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very low competence) to 7 (very high competence), with higher scores indicating greater perceived professional competence. The derived data was analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The overall level of self-reported nursing competence was high, with a mean score of 76.69%. Among these six domains, the domain of "documentation and administration of care" scored the highest (78.26%), and "care pedagogy" scored the lowest (75.23%). The items that scored high included "respectful communication," "clinical follow-up," and "documentation," which scored "to a high degree." The items that scored lower included "psychological needs," "group-based education," and "respect for different values," which scored "to a fairly high degree.".". CONCLUSIONS: The Jordanian nursing community views itself as very competent; however, improvements are needed in particular fields. Continuous learning and training are required in order to retain and upgrade professional competency. The findings highlight the value of mentorship, a supportive work environment, and continuing education. Future research should include peer and supervisor evaluations to validate self-reported competence and better guide workforce development strategies.</description>

Less is known about the involvement of other immune pathways and the potential role of other HDM proteins in allergic disease. In this study, the association between HDM allergy and immune responses to the HDM proteome was investigated. METHODS: The HDM proteome was represented by 40 purified recombinant HDM proteins (19 known allergens and 21 novel proteins). T-cell responses to HDM proteins were determined ex vivo and antibody responses (IgA, IgE, IgG and IgG4) were measured using micro arrays and basophil activation in 21 HDM allergic donors and 16 non-allergic controls. Changes in specific IgE, IgG and IgG4 during SQ HDM SLIT-Tablet immunotherapy was assessed in 38 subjects with allergic asthma. RESULTS: HDM proteins were broadly immunogenic inducing comparable IgG, IgA, and non-TH2 cytokine responses in both allergic and non-allergic individuals. Specific IgE, IgG4 and TH2 cytokine responses were largely restricted to the allergic donors. IgE and IgG4 were primarily directed to known major allergens and overlapping in specificity whereas cellular TH2 responses extended beyond the known HDM allergens. Individual proteins displayed distinct immunological profiles. HDM sublingual immunotherapy increased the levels of specific IgE and IgG4 but did not change the overall pattern of recognition. CONCLUSION: HDM proteins are highly immunogenic and give rise to complex patterns of immune recognition also in the absence of allergy. This has potential implications for the pathogenesis of HDM allergy and the mode of action of allergy immunotherapy.</description>

Women are also invited at age 45, 55 and 65 years if they did not test HPV-negative 5 years earlier (risk-based invitation). With influx of birth cohorts vaccinated against HPV, de-intensification may be needed to maintain a cost-effective program. We used an updated and recalibrated model of type-specific HPV transmission and cervical carcinogenesis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 16 strategies with reduced screening intensity. Strategies varied by starting age, screening interval, and number of risk-based invitations, possibly stratified for HPV vaccination status. Cost-effectiveness was measured by net monetary benefit (NMB). A positive NMB indicates that a strategy is cost-effective compared to the current policy. Two strategies without stratification for HPV vaccination status had a positive NMB. An NMB of EUR 1.6 million per 100,000 women was obtained when, compared to current screening, the invitation at age 35 was based on the HPV-test result at age 30. An NMB of EUR 1.8 million per 100,000 women was obtained when women were re-invited every 5 years if they were HPV-positive or had not been tested 5 years earlier. If reduced screening was only applied to vaccinated women, the highest NMB was EUR 1.3 million per 100,000 women. Thus, reducing screening in HPV-vaccinated cohorts is cost-effective when re-inviting women after 10 years if they test HPV-negative. Stratification for HPV vaccination status does not improve the cost-effectiveness of screening.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen-Charles J, Davey DJ, Rousseau E, Little F, Toska E, Mathola N, Macdonald P, Vanto O, Wallace M, Bekker LG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-026-26370-z'&gt;10.1186/s12889-026-26370-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41656212/'&gt;41656212&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The risk of HIV acquisition is heightened during pregnancy and early parenthood with the additional risk of vertical HIV transmission. While recent studies have improved our understanding of PrEP use among pregnant and breastfeeding women, further evidence is needed to inform the design of interventions that support sustained use, especially among young women who are pregnant or parenting. METHODS: We analysed data from young women aged 15-29 years who initiated PrEP in an implementation study (FastPrEP) in Cape Town, South Africa. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between pregnancy or parenting status (≥ 1 living child) and PrEP discontinuation at 1- and 4-months post-initiation, based on pharmacy refill data. The primary exposure was currently pregnant or having a child (vs. not); secondary analyses stratified by age (15-24 vs. 25-29 years) among women who were pregnant/parenting. Models were adjusted for age and hypothesised explanatory factors were included in sensitivity analysis: service delivery location, contraceptive use, HIV risk perception, and relationship status. RESULTS: Between August 2022 and June 2024 n = 4,876 young women initiated PrEP; 44% were pregnant/parenting (of which 10% were pregnant), and the median age was 21.6 years (IQR:18-25). At 1-month, women who were pregnant/parenting had higher odds of PrEP discontinuation (aOR:1.30, 95% CI:1.14-1.49). At 4-months this relationship persisted (aOR:1.41, 95% CI:1.12-1.78) compared with non-pregnant/parenting women. Among those pregnant/parenting, younger women (15-24 years) had higher odds of discontinuation at 1-month (aOR:1.31, 95% CI:1.08-1.58) and 4-months (aOR:1.41, 95%CI:1.02-1.96) compared to women aged 25-29. In the fully adjusted multivariable model, receiving PrEP in mobile clinics (aOR:0.71, 95% CI:0.61-0.82) vs. government clinics was associated with lower odds of early discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Young women who are pregnant/parenting face elevated risk of early PrEP discontinuation. Differentiated, life-stage and youth-responsive interventions, such as counselling, partner involvement, and integration with maternal and child health, or sexual and reproductive health services, are critical to improving PrEP persistence among this priority population. This population should be prioritised in the rollout of long-acting PrEP formulations, which may better align with their needs and reduce the burden of daily adherence.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 209 ESCC patients treated with nCRT. PV substructures (LSPV, LIPV, RSPV, RIPV) were contoured on radiotherapy planning scans, and dose-volume histogram parameters were extracted. AF events were ascertained through systematic cardiac monitoring. Multivariate competing risk regression was employed to assess associations between PV doses and AF, with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, surgical resection as a time-dependent covariate, and mortality as a competing risk. RESULTS: Among 209 patients (84.9% male; median age 66 years), the 2-year cumulative incidence of AF was 8.89%, with a median time to AF of 13 months. Among the 25 AF events, 15 (60%) occurred after esophagectomy, with a median time from surgery to AF of 2.1 months. On univariate analysis, age, hypertension, LIPV-∼Dmax∼, RSPV-∼Dmax∼, and coronary heart disease (CHD) were associated with AF. In the multivariable model, LIPV-∼Dmax remained an independent predictor (adjusted HR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.19-8.42, p = 0.021) after adjustment for age (HR = 3.66, p = 0.009), CHD (HR = 2.59, p = 0.019), and surgical resection. Patients with LIPV-∼Dmax∼ &gt;28.87 Gy had a significantly higher AF incidence (12.3%) than those below this threshold (p = 0.008). Moreover, AF was associated with inferior 2-year recurrence-free survival (36.9% vs. 78.6%, p = 0.0051) and inferior 2-year overall survival (58.3% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Maximum dose to the LIPV was independently associated with increased AF risk and worse survival outcomes in ESCC patients receiving nCRT. These results highlighted the potential value of LIPV-sparing radiotherapy techniques and enhanced AF surveillance in this population. External validation in larger prospective cohorts was needed before firm clinical guidelines can be established.</description>

In this prospective, multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (NCT03154983), patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2, day 1) and S-1 (body surface area-based dosing, days 1-14) every 3 weeks, plus daily apatinib (500 mg), for up to 6 planned cycles. 45 patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up time of 12.4 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.8%-9.4%) and 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.3%-15.5%), respectively in the full analysis set. Patients completing ≥4 cycles achieved a better mOS of 14.5 months (95% CI: 12.0%-17.1%). The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 62.2% (95% CI, 46.5%-76.2%) and 82.2% (95% CI, 67.9%-92.0%), respectively, including one complete response (CR). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 48.9% of patients, most commonly oral mucositis and neutropenia. These findings support apatinib plus DS as a promising biomarker-independent first-line treatment strategy for mGC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a total of 60 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Thirty patients who had been treated with metformin and subsequently received dapagliflozin in addition to metformin during doxorubicin therapy constituted the dapagliflozin group. The non-dapagliflozin group consisted of 30 patients who, while continuing metformin, were initiated on another oral antidiabetic agent (excluding dapagliflozin) alongside doxorubicin therapy. N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) were measured at baseline and at the 3rd month of treatment. Between-group baseline characteristics were compared using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables. Within-group changes from baseline to 3 months were analyzed with paired t-tests. Between-group comparisons of 3-month outcomes and changes (ΔLVEF, ΔLVGLS, ΔNT-proBNP) were also conducted using independent samples t-tests. To evaluate the independent effect of dapagliflozin on LVGLS, multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. Model fit was reported with adjusted R², F-statistics and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the non-dapagliflozin group, LVEF and NT-proBNP levels showed no significant differences between baseline and post-treatment; however, LVGLS values significantly deteriorated. In contrast, the dapagliflozin group demonstrated a significant increase in LVEF (- 2.000 [95% CI - 2.392, - 1.608]) and LVGLS (+ 1.367 [95% CI + 1.159, + 1.574]), as well as a marked reduction in NT-proBNP levels (+ 64.933 [95% CI + 57.902, + 71.964]) after 3 months of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). At the third month, the dapagliflozin group exhibited significantly better LVGLS (+ 2.133 [95% CI + 1.346, + 2.921]) and lower NT-proBNP levels (+ 57.000 [95% CI + 28.302, + 85.698]) compared with the non-dapagliflozin group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed that dapagliflozin use was independently associated with significant improvement in LVGLS at 3 months. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, dapagliflozin was associated with more favorable short-term surrogate changes in LVGLS and NT-proBNP during doxorubicin therapy. The favorable changes observed in LVEF, LVGLS, and NT-proBNP parameters suggest that dapagliflozin may be considered a potential cardioprotective agent and incorporated into preventive strategies against chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity in diabetic patients. These hypothesis-generating findings require confirmation in larger randomized trials powered for clinical endpoints with longer follow-up. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.</description>

However, there have been no prior studies on using bacteriophages for peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This report presents the successful treatment of refractory peritonitis in a 71-year-old male peritoneal dialysis patient using bacteriophages combined with antibiotics. The patient has a history of refractory and repeat peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus, which was resolved through simultaneous catheter replacement (SCR). Subsequently, the patient experiences another episode of refractory peritonitis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although this strain is found to be susceptible to amikacin and imipenem, a 14-day course of treatment with these antibiotics in the abdominal cavity fails to resolve the peritonitis. Combined with antibiotic therapy, the patient is successfully treated with intraperitoneal phage therapy targeting his bacterial isolate. We monitor the longitudinal progression of phage loads, phage-neutralizing antibodies, interleukin-6 levels, and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the dialysate effluent during the bacteriophage therapy. The combination of a phage cocktail and imipenem (IPM) demonstrates a greater effect in killing bacteria than either treatment alone, which indicates that a synergistic effect exists between the phage cocktail and IPM. Intraperitoneal IPM is discontinued after a 3-week course of treatment. At the same time, oral fluconazole is given to prevent fungal infections. The patient is discharged without any antibiotics. After this round of treatment, the patient remains healthy during the one-month follow-up. Our study suggests that personalized phage therapy combined with sensitive antibiotics can play a significant role in managing refractory peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, showing promise for future applications.</description>

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load ≥50 copies per mL in five [1·5%] of 342 vs one [0·6%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0·9% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1·9 to 2·9). The rates of adverse events (74·6% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71·3% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3·2 [95% CI -4·7 to 11·6]), treatment-related adverse events (10·2% [35] vs 9·4% [16]; 0·9 [-5·1 to 6·0]), serious adverse events (4·4% [15] vs 6·4% [11]; -2·0 [-7·1 to 1·9]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2·9% [ten] vs 1·8% [three]; 1·2 [-2·3 to 3·9]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Orkin C, Mngqibisa R, Velez JD, Kumar P, Braun DL, Carr A, Bloch M, Walmsley S, Tebas P, Yokomaku Y, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01945-2'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01945-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41654374/'&gt;41654374&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Doravirine and islatravir is an investigational, once-daily, single-tablet regimen containing two potent antiretrovirals with complementary mechanisms of action and resistance profiles. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from stable, oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the fixed combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1. METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 53 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in eight countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a viral load of fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL on any oral, two-drug or three-drug ART regimen for at least 3 months, with no history of treatment failure, known resistance to doravirine, or active hepatitis B infection, were randomly assigned (2:1) according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size three) to receive oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) once daily or to continue baseline ART for 48 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by the anchor antiretroviral drug class (integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor) in the baseline regimen. The primary endpoint (assessed in all treated participants) was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 (analysed according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach); non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The safety analysis population included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05631093, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Feb 20 and Oct 24, 2023, 614 individuals were screened for eligibility, of whom 553 were randomly assigned to receive doravirine and islatravir (n=368) or baseline ART (n=185). 551 participants received at least one dose of allocated medication: 366 in the doravirine and islatravir group and 185 in the baseline ART group. Of these 551 participants, 332 (60%) were assigned male and 219 (40%) were assigned female at birth, and the median age was 51 years (IQR 41-59); 250 (45%) identified as Black or African American and 80 (15%) identified as Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. Doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority at week 48, with viral loads of 50 copies per mL or higher in five (1·4%) of 366 participants versus nine (4·9%) of 185 participants on baseline ART (difference -3·6% [multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -7·8 to -0·8]). Treatment-related adverse events were more common with doravirine and islatravir (44 [12·0%] of 366 participants) than with baseline ART (nine [4·9%] of 185 participants; difference 7·2 [95% CI 2·2 to 11·6]). Rates were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the baseline ART group for any adverse event (79·5% [291 of 366 participants] vs 83·8% [155 of 185 participants]; difference -4·3 [-10·7 to 2·8]), serious adverse events (6·3% [23] vs 4·9% [nine]; 1·4 [-3·2 to 5·2]), and discontinuation due to adverse events (0·5% [two] vs 2·2% [four]; -1·6 [-4·9 to 0·2]). One death occurred (in the baseline ART group) and was not considered treatment-related. No participants discontinued treatment as a result of protocol-specified declines in CD4 cell or total lymphocyte counts. INTERPRETATION: Doravirine and islatravir is efficacious and well tolerated and would represent the first non-INSTI-based, two-drug regimen for HIV-1 treatment. With increasing concern over the potential development of widespread INSTI resistance, this once-daily, oral, single-tablet regimen could be a potential option for people living with HIV-1 requiring a change to their antiretroviral regimen. The safety and efficacy findings support the ongoing development of islatravir, a drug with long-acting potential. FUNDING: Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.</description>

This multicenter study aimed to compare characteristics of MSFB, MSFBO, and ODS. METHODS: A multicenter international retrospective cohort study was conducted on adults with MSFBs and ODS who underwent sinus surgery. First in MSFBs, it was determined whether different dental conditions were more likely in FB versus non-FB sides. Second, clinical features and dental pathologies were compared between MSFBO and ODS. For analyses, dental conditions were considered individually and as two groups: infectious pathologies and dental/oral procedures with indwelling metallic materials. RESULTS: After exclusions, there were 203 MSFBs and 163 ODS. Among MSFBs, 141 were MSFBOs. FB sides were associated with sinus protrusion of root canal treatment (RCT) materials (p = 0.040) and dental implants (p = 0.040). Compared to MSFBO, ODS patients were younger, more likely to have MS purulence (OR = 40.9, p &lt; 0.010), more likely associated with apical periodontitis (OR = 2.59, p = 0.010) and oroantral fistulas (OR = 6.94, p = 0.020), and less likely associated with extruded RCT materials (OR = 0.01, p = 0.010) and protruded midface screws (OR &lt; 0.01, p = 0.010). Comparing purulent MSFBO and ODS, ODS was more associated with infectious dental pathologies (p &lt; 0.009). CONCLUSION: Compared to MSFBs, MSFBOs were associated with RCT extrusion and implant protrusion. Compared to MSFBOs, ODS was more likely purulent and associated with infectious dental pathologies. While ODS is often distinct from MSFBO, the two conditions can coexist, and surgeons must determine whether patients have infectious dental pathology requiring treatment with both conditions.</description>

Standard approaches typically rely on real-time bronchoscopic or ultrasound guidance, which may be unavailable in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and learning curve of landmark-guided PDT performed without adjunctive visualization. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 71 consecutive adult patients who underwent landmark-guided PDT without bronchoscopic or ultrasound guidance between August 2024 and June 2025. All procedures were performed by a head and neck surgeon newly trained in PDT. Outcomes included procedure duration, complication rates, and patient-specific predictors of procedural difficulty. The learning curve was assessed using correlation and linear regression, and independent predictors of prolonged procedure time were identified through multivariable linear modeling. RESULTS: The median procedure time was 7.0 (3.0-54.0) min, and a significant learning curve was observed (r = -0.41; p &lt; 0.001). Complications occurred in 14.1% of patients, with major events being limited to one bleeding episode and two pneumothoraces. In multivariable analyses, prior cerebrovascular accident and increased cricoid-manubrium distance independently predicted prolonged procedure times. CONCLUSION: Landmark-guided PDT without real-time visualization was feasible and safe following a brief learning phase. With appropriate patient selection and operator training, this technique may represent a practical alternative in settings where visualization adjuncts are unavailable.</description>

The optimal triage of HPV-positive women could be a combination of cytology triage with HPV genotyping or p16/Ki67 staining. We report number of screen positives, colposcopies, and cervical lesions of three different triage algorithms (p16/Ki67, HPV16/18, or HPV16/18/31/33/52) in HPV-positive women with low-grade cytological abnormalities. We included 178,317 women with a sample in 2021 of which 91,517 were screened with HPV and 86,800 with cytology. All women were followed for 18 months. Almost three times as many women screened positive with HPV-based screening compared to cytology-based screening (RR 2.99, 95% 2.93-3.05) and colposcopies derived from the screening program were also more common (RR 1.68, 95% 1.63-1.73). p16/Ki67 triage resulted in more colposcopies (RR 1.86, 95% 1.76-1.95) than HPV16/18 (RR 1.54, 95% 1.44-1.65) and HPV16/18/31/33/52 (RR 1.63, 95% 1.55-1.71). The excess in colposcopy referrals was reduced when non-screening-derived colposcopies were included (intention-to-treat). Nevertheless, more women with CIN2 or worse were detected in the HPV group than in the cytology group per screened woman; in the p16/Ki67 triage group (RR 1.65, 95% 1.54-1.77), in the HPV16/18 group (RR 1.36, 95% 1.23-1.50), and in the HPV16/18/31/33/52 group (RR 1.48, 95% 1.37-1.59). HPV-based screening, as compared with cytology screening, resulted in more screen positives, but all three triage algorithms substantially reduced the excess number of referrals to colposcopy. p16/Ki67 compared to triage with HPV16/18 may detect more cervical lesions.</description>

In addition, it was originally described as having minimal bone stock making dental rehabilitation with dental implants very difficult. METHODS: Retrospective review from 2015 to 2025 of patients that underwent segmental resections involving the maxillofacial complex and received scapula free tissue transfer with dental implants. Contributing surgeons are affiliated with the following institutions: Northwell Health (Northwell Cancer Institute), University of Pittsburgh, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the Medical University of South Carolina. RESULTS: Eighty-seven dental implants were placed in 29 patients mainly using the angular branch of the thoracodorsal artery. Fifteen patients (51.7%) had their implants placed during the initial ablative and scapular reconstruction. The median number of dental implants placed in each scapula was two, and overall implant osseointegration was 88.8% after following patients on average for 41 months. CONCLUSION: Our multi-institution review has demonstrated that the scapula free flap has adequate bone quantity to support immediate and delayed dental implants to provide long term success for dental rehabilitation. We recognize that the sample size in this series is relatively small; however, this series represents one of the largest in the current literature.</description>

The risk associated with modern mediastinal RT in pediatric cHL is unknown. METHODS: We modeled the risk of SMN in children with cHL who enrolled in the multi-institutional Children's Oncology Group AHOD1331 trial (2015-2019) and received mediastinal RT. FINDINGS: Among 587 trial patients, 296 (50%) received mediastinal RT and were eligible for this analysis. Proton therapy was used for 25%, photon intensity modulated RT (IMRT) for 46%, and photon 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) for 28%. The RT prescription dose was 21 Gy in 83% and 30 Gy in 16%. The estimated mean lifetime attributable risk at 70 years of age of breast carcinoma (females) was 2.92% (1.45% proton; 4.36% IMRT; 1.82% 3D-CRT; p&lt;0.0001), lung carcinoma was 5.37% (4.15% proton; 6.24% IMRT; 5.07% 3D-CRT; p&lt;0.0001), and thyroid carcinoma was 0.17% (0.25% proton; 0.17% IMRT; 0.12% 3D-CRT; p=0.271). The predicted risk of breast carcinoma was higher among female patients treated with their arms raised versus arms down (p&lt;0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Normal tissue doses associated with contemporary mediastinal RT produce lower predicted SMN risks than were observed in cohorts treated with historical RT approaches, with substantial variation among individuals. On average, proton therapy is associated with a lower predicted risk. These findings have implications for the selection of therapies, counseling of patients, planning of RT, and recommendations for SMN screening.</description>

This study investigated the clinical features of tumors that were missed during endoscopic examinations. AIM: To investigate and analyze the endoscopic and clinical features of missed anal and anorectal tumors. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with anal and anorectal tumors between 2014 and 2024 at West China Hospital were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, endoscopic findings, and missed diagnosis records were extracted from electronic medical records and telephone follow-up. A descriptive and error-classification analysis was performed to identify the reasons for missed diagnoses during endoscopy. RESULTS: Descriptive and error-classification analysis among the 83 enrolled patients, 10 (7 with adenocarcinoma and 3 with squamous cell carcinoma) had undergone previous endoscopic examinations with negative diagnoses, resulting in a missed detection proportion of 12.0%. Six missed cases with 15 prior colonoscopies in which the lesions were overlooked had complete medical records. The mean number of endoscopic procedures performed prior to the definitive diagnosis was 2.5 (range: 1-5), with an average diagnostic delay of 43.4 months (range: 1-82). The causes of missed diagnoses included exposure errors (n = 8), judgment errors (n = 6), and biopsy errors (n = 1). The proportion of endoscopic rectal retroflexion to observe anus was 20% . CONCLUSION: The missed diagnosis proportion of anal and anorectal tumors was high during endoscopic examination. Comprehensive endoscopic observation and enhanced recognition of the endoscopic features of anal tumors are essential.</description>

Here, we report a montmorillonite-based oral fermentation system (MOFS) that achieves long-lasting in-situ preparation of beneficial bioproducts for intestinal homeostasis restoration. MOFS is fabricated by loading metabolic substrates in the lamellar structure of montmorillonite via cation replacement and adsorbing the substrate-related bacteria through electrostatic interactions. The water-impermeable property and mucoadhesive ability of montmorillonite endow MOFS with high oral availability and extended retention in the gut. The continuous release of loaded substrates and the formation of biofilms by carried bacteria enable long-term yet efficient synthesis of beneficial metabolites in the intestine, which comprehensively improve gut microbiota composition, suppress intestinal inflammation, and increase the integrity of the gut barrier. In murine models of imbalanced intestinal homeostasis, MOFS demonstrates superior efficacies by alleviating the associated symptoms, even in comparison to clinical therapeutics.</description>

While its colonization usually begins at birth, the extent of maternal involvement in yeast transmission to their offspring, particularly across different racial groups, remains unclear. Studies have shown elevated levels of C. albicans in both mothers and children, with genetically related fungal strains, suggesting maternal transmission, but the racial component, notably higher levels in Black children, lacks thorough investigation of underlying factors. Our research aimed to address this gap by investigating how maternal and demographic factors such as socioeconomic status and oral health affect C. albicans levels in infants across Black and non-Black populations. Employing a partial linear semiparametric mixed-effects model (PLSMM) with variable selection and race-based stratification, we identified predictors that have different effects depending on the infant's race among a large pool of predictors. Through this stratified analysis, we aimed to discern crucial factors significantly contributing to C. albicans colonization while minimizing the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables. In this stratified analysis, exclusive breastfeeding ([Formula: see text]) and maternal marriage ([Formula: see text]) were significant predictors among non-Black infants, while maternal employment ([Formula: see text]) and post-delivery maternal C. albicans ([Formula: see text]) were significant among Black infants. Our findings highlighted race-specific associations between C. albicans levels in children and factors such as breastfeeding practices, marital status, maternal oral hygiene, and maternal C. albicans levels. Our study underscores the importance of race-specific considerations in understanding C. albicans colonization in infants, offering insights for tailored interventions and healthcare strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations.</description>

Despite growing attention to value integration in EFL materials, empirical studies on moral and value representation in oral English textbooks remain sparse, and learners' perspectives on value acquisition through oral instruction are underexplored-this study aims to address these gaps. The study employed a mixed-methods approach: the researcher systematically analyzed 318 pages of New Inside Out Book 1 and Book 2 (first-year college EFL oral English textbooks), screening all module types including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue, listening, reading, writing, and exercise for value-related content, which was then coded and recorded in Excel. Frequency statistics show the sample textbooks include 273 value-laden verbal text samples, with a Chi-Square Test revealing statistically significant differences in dimension emphasis between the two volumes. Within Martin and White's (2005) Language Appraisal Theory, qualitative textual analysis identifies the value significance of linguistic resources as a prominent feature across module types. Additionally, to gather learner feedback on the effectiveness of value education in the oral English course, an online questionnaire survey (via Wen Juan Xing platform) was administered to learners who used the selected EFL oral English textbooks for a whole academic year. The survey showed that values-based EFL instruction positively impacted morality and personal growth.</description>

In this study, we investigate the etiology and management of intraoperative flap loss. METHODS: Retrospective review between 2010 and 2024 at 6 institutions. RESULTS: There were 7423 free flaps performed with 46 instances of intraoperative flap failure (0.62%). The most common recipient subsite was oral cavity (27/46, 57%). Anterolateral thigh (ALT) was the most common flap type to fail (18/46, 39%), followed by the fibula (15/46, 32%). The most common reasons for total failure were clotting without observable vessel abnormality (12/35, 34.3%), poor quality perforator (11/35, 31.4%), and vessel spasm or intimal abnormality leading to clotting (8/35, 22.9%). The most common acute management was converting to an additional free flap intraoperatively (28/46, 60.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Flap failure intraoperatively is rare. The majority of cases were acutely managed with an additional flap to provide defect coverage.</description>

We sought to explore sponsorship opportunities by gender by investigating committee leadership, keynote speakership, and panelist-moderator ratios from prior American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and Combined Otolaryngology Sections Meeting (COSM) conferences. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional review of publicly available program conferencing. SETTING: Literature review. METHODS: Gender breakdowns of committee leadership and keynote speakerships were recorded from official AAO-HNS conference programming from 2013 to 2021. Panelist-moderator gender ratios were calculated for the AAO-HNS conferences from 2023 to 2024. Society leadership representation and panelist-moderator gender ratios were also investigated from recent COSM conferences between 2018 and 2024 via official programming. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2021, analyses of the AAO-HNS national conferences determined that women comprised on average of 29.6% of annual directorship roles (range 12.5-37.55), 35.6% of board member positions (26.3%-47.4%), and 25.2% of keynote speaker appointments (0%-40%). Between 2019 and 2023, in COSM, women held on average 23.3% of available society chair/secretary positions and 19.0% of society president roles. The ratio of female:total panelist was positively correlated with female moderators. CONCLUSION: Female representation in AAO-HNS and COSM leadership and keynote speakerships has improved over time in recent years, and appears to be on par with academic otolaryngology workforce composition. However, male moderators presenting panels at both conferences had significantly fewer female panelists versus female moderators. This difference in national panel participation opportunities may impact career advancement and national reputation for female otolaryngologists.</description>

We present the largest cohort to date evaluating the procedure's effectiveness and compare functional outcomes by etiology of BVFI. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive patients treated at a tertiary care center from April 2014 to 2024. All patients who underwent TCMA for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) or bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) were included. Exclusion criteria were multi-level stenosis and prior airway resection or reconstruction. We assessed rate of decannulation, Voice handicap index (VHI), dyspnea index (DI), eating assessment tool (EAT-10), and cough severity index (CSI) scores and compared outcomes by surgical indication. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included and the majority had PGS (64%). Seventy six percent of tracheostomy dependent patients were decannulated. Surgical indication did not impact time to decannulation or number of interventions required for decannulation. DI was improved at 1-month post-operation and last clinic visit (p &lt; 0.0001). DI was slightly improved for the PGS cohort at last clinic visit, compared to the BVFP cohort (p = 0.04). There were no differences in VHI, EAT-10, or CSI after surgery compared with baseline, or differences based on BVFI etiology. CONCLUSIONS: TCMA is an effective surgical intervention for BVFI that provides a reliable rate of decannulation and improves respiratory function without compromising voice or swallowing outcomes, regardless of the BVFI etiology.</description>

Here, we develop PRISM, an efficient computational framework for precise microorganism identification and decontamination from low-biomass sequencing data. PRISM achieves robust performance when benchmarked on 230 independent datasets with known true-positive and contaminant taxa. We then use PRISM to profile 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. We identify consistent microbial signatures in gastrointestinal tract, head-and-neck, and urogenital tract tumors, and sparse signal elsewhere. In pancreatic cancer, we associate microbial detection with altered host protein glycosylation pathways and greater smoking exposure. Lastly, we consider the impact of sequencing approaches on positive and negative data interpretation. Overall, PRISM improves the reliability of microbial profiling and allows leveraging of existing human genomic data for the concurrent detection of host-microbial signatures with potential molecular and clinical significance.</description>

Although dMMR/MSI predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancers, their relevance in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the MMR system and MSI in patients with apparently sporadic ACC and explored associations with clinical characteristics and outcomes. In a subgroup, correlation between dMMR/MSI and response to ICI was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was carried out in 109 ACC tissues with molecular data. Germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) and somatic oncogenic/likely oncogenic (O/LO) MMR variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. MLH1 methylation and EPCAM deletions were assessed via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. MSI was analysed using plex PCR. RESULTS: dMMR was identified in 15 (14%) cases, mainly involving MSH6 loss (n = 9, 8.3%) either with MSH2 or alone. No significant differences were observed in hormone secretion, European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) stage, proliferation index (Ki67%), S-GRAS (Stage, Grade, Resection status, Age, Symptoms) score, progression-free survival (8 versus 14 months) and overall survival (72 versus 80 months) between patients with and without dMMR. A slightly higher frequency of other malignancies was observed in dMMR cases (27% versus 11%, P = 0.09). Ten dMMR tumours were linked to P/LP germline (n = 4, 26.7%) or O/LO somatic (n = 5, 33.6%) MMR variants or MLH1 hypermethylation (n = 1, 6.7%), but only three (20%) showed MSI. Lynch syndrome was identified in 5% of patients. Among 12 patients treated with ICIs, time to progression was similar between those with and without defective MMR (4 versus 5 months, P = 0.21). Only one of five ICI responders had a confirmed MSH6 variant. CONCLUSION: DMMR occurs in a minority of ACC, often without MSI. Although Lynch syndrome accounts for a subset of cases, dMMR is not predictive of clinical features or ICI response. Nonetheless, MMR testing remains important for identifying individuals at hereditary cancer risk.</description>

In this study, we identify a distinct subset of autoimmune LTS characterized by edema of the inferior true vocal folds that extends to the superior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, termed "infracordal stenosis." The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of infracordal stenosis and compare it to typical autoimmune-related subglottic stenosis (AI-SGS). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis evaluated by both rheumatology and otolaryngology at our institution to identify two groups: patients with infracordal stenosis and those with typical AI-SGS. Data on immunosuppressive treatments and airway dilation procedures were collected. Time to first dilation was compared between groups. RESULTS: Among 49 patients with autoimmune LTS, 11 had infracordal involvement. Six patients had isolated infracordal stenosis while five had concomitant subglottic involvement. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed longer time to first dilation in patients with infracordal involvement (median 792 vs. 44 days; p = 0.048). Four out of six patients with isolated infracordal stenosis required no dilations during their entire follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Among autoimmune LTS patients referred to rheumatology, those with infracordal involvement experienced longer time to first dilation compared to those with typical AI-SGS. These findings suggest that infracordal stenosis may represent a distinct, glucocorticoid-responsive phenotype within autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis, with implications for treatment selection and multidisciplinary care.</description>

This paper introduces WLAU-Net, a novel architecture integrating three key innovations for contrast agent free segmentation. First, our transfer learning framework pre-trains the encoder on venous phase CT images to capture discriminative tumor features, then transfers and freezes these learned weights when processing non-contrast phase data, effectively preventing domain shift. Second, we implement a wavelet transformation module using sym4 wavelet decomposition to split images into four frequency subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH). By selectively amplifying horizontal (HL) and vertical (LH) edge coefficients during reconstruction, we enhance tumor boundary delineation while preserving anatomical context. Third, a local attention mechanism with Gaussian-based adaptive weighting dynamically prioritizes low-intensity tumor regions over high-intensity areas, sharpening focus on subtle boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate WLAU-Net's superiority with a 65.37% Dice score and 96.23% ACC, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including CS-UNet (64.50% Dice, 93.85% ACC) and Swin-UNet (62.34% Dice, 91.15% ACC). Ablation studies reveal critical contributions from each component: enabling all modules (transfer learning, Gaussian attention, and wavelet enhancement) achieves optimal performance, while removing the wavelet module reduces Dice by 1.16% (64.21%) and disabling both Gaussian and wavelet modules decreases ACC by 3.0% (93.24%). Compared to contrast-enhanced methods (92.1% ACC), our approach maintains competitive diagnostic accuracy (96.23% ACC) while eliminating allergic risks, offering a clinically viable alternative for contrast agent sensitive patients.</description>

However, the prognosis of patients is poor, there is an urgent need to explore more effective combined treatment strategies to improve survival outcomes. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy and radiotherapy. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched using a combination of subject terms and free words. Data were extracted from studies that met the inclusion criteria and meta-analyzed using Stata 17.0 software to compare the efficacy and treatment-related adverse toxicities of chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy plus radiotherapy with chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy alone. RESULTS: Finally, a total of 12 studies (11 retrospective cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) involving 2,428 patients were included in the analysis, with squamous cell carcinoma accounting for 98.9%. In terms of efficacy, meta-analysis revealed the radiotherapy combined group (RT group) had significantly higher objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) than those of the non-radiotherapy combined group (NRT group). Stratified analysis showed that for patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based systemic treatment and oligometastatic esophageal cancer, the OS and PFS of the RT group were significantly better than those of the NRT group (ICIs ± radiotherapy: Hazard ratio (HR)=0.61, 95%CI:0.48-0.76, P&lt;0.001; HR = 0.60, 95%CI:0.49-0.73, P&lt;0.001, oligometastatic esophageal cancer: HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64-0.84, P&lt;0.001; HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.58-0.76, p&lt;0.001). The incidence of grade≥3 hematological toxicity and treatment-related pneumonia in the RT group was higher than that in the NRT group, and there was no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse reactions between the two groups(2.5%-12.2% vs. 3.4%-13.2%, P = 0.828). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data, systemic therapy combined with local radiotherapy may be a better option for advanced esophageal cancer, but the potential risk of higher hematological toxicity and treatment-related pneumonia need to be weighed.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chopra R, Gupta S, Hooda A&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.012'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.012&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41663059/'&gt;41663059&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There are notable differences in facial morphology between obese individuals and those of normal weight. A person's body mass index (BMI) is a key factor, affecting the thickness of facial soft tissues. PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the association between BMI and facial anthropometric measurements. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This prospective, observational (cross-sectional) study was conducted among undergraduate dental students at the Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences (PGIDS), Rohtak, who were originally from Haryana. Subjects with a history of trauma and congenital or chronic diseases affecting craniofacial morphology, facial surgeries, facial deformities, orthodontic treatment, or systemic diseases such as hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism or diabetes that could influence BMI were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: BMI (ratio of body weight to the square of standing height) served as the predictor, and participants were categorized into four groups: underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal (BMI = 18.5 to 22.9), overweight (BMI = 23 to 24.9), and obese (BMI ≥25). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): Measurements for 12 facial anthropometric parameters were obtained using a digital vernier caliper. COVARIATES: The covariates were sex and age. ANALYSES: One-way ANOVA, general linear model, and independent sample t test were utilized for statistical analysis. The significance criterion was P &lt; .01. RESULTS: Among the 202 subjects included, 137 (67.8%) were female, and 65 (32.2%) were male. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 30 years, with a mean age of 21.59 ± 1.82 years. Statistically significant differences were observed in face width (P &lt; .001), lower facial width (P &lt; .001), nose width (P &lt; .001), and lower third face height (P = .002) across BMI categories. The mean BMI showed a statistically significant difference regarding sex; however, this difference was not significant concerning age (≤20 years vs &gt;20 years). There was a statistically significant relationship between sex and the studied facial anthropometric parameters, except for nose length, face height (middle third), and facial index. Subjects ≤20 years versus &gt;20 years showed a statistically significant difference in outercanthal distance, nose length, and mouth width. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study results suggest that BMI is associated with facial anthropometric measurements; therefore, it may be important to adjust anthropometric measures for BMI when planning orthodontic treatment, esthetic surgeries, and facial reconstruction.</description>

However, little is known about the association between spending and their overall survival (OS). METHODS: We recruited 11,037 ESCC patients who were admitted between August, 2009 and December, 2018 at the Southern Center (Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College), and between January, 2012 to December, 2017 at the Northern Center (Anyang Cancer Hospital). Spending terciles were the exposure measure, and OS was the outcome. OS in terciles 2 and 3 was compared with OS in tercile 1 (the lowest spending tercile) using Cox regression models. Analyses were stratified by TNM stage and study center. RESULTS: Monthly hospital spending followed an "L-shaped" trend. After a maximum follow-up of 12.52 years, the median survival time was 4.70 years. Higher spending was associated with worse OS in stage 0-II patients (adjusted HRtercile 3 vs 1 = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27-1.89), but with better OS in stage III-IV patients (adjusted HRtercile 2 vs 1 = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74-0.90; adjusted HRtercile 3 vs 1 = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64-0.83). These associations were consistent across both the Southern and Northern Centers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that early-stage ESCC patients may benefit from more conservative treatment approaches, whereas advanced-stage patients require comprehensive and sufficient treatment.</description>

While international guidelines provide an overarching evidence framework for breast cancer management, their practical application at the regional level often requires adaptation to local healthcare resources. There is an unmet need to optimize the treatment sequencing strategies for patients with HR+/HER2-negative mBC in the GCC region through expert guidance. Given this context, a virtual advisory board involving 10 oncologists from the GCC region was convened in November 2024. The panel aimed to review current evidence and develop pragmatic, implementable recommendations for second-line management. This consensus uniquely contextualizes global evidence for GCC-specific healthcare constraints, addressing gaps in diagnostic access, affordability, and real-world feasibility, while providing treatment recommendations that help clinicians refine therapeutic strategies and incorporate patient preferences for improved outcomes. The panel recommends early genomic testing (PIK3CA, AKT, BRCA, ESR1) to guide therapy, prioritizing targeted agents such as oral SERDs and PI3K/AKT inhibitors in second-line sequencing, cautious use of alpelisib in diabetic patients, and incorporating patient preferences through shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care.</description>

METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we analyzed the incidence, mortality, and DALYs of breast, ovarian, and thyroid cancers across 15 countries (1990-2021). Trends were quantified using EAPC, and mortality trajectories through 2050 were projected using GAM. RESULTS: Breast cancer exhibited a polarized pattern: mortality steadily declined in High-SDI nations but surged in Low-SDI regions. Thyroid cancer revealed a dichotomy of screening-driven overdiagnosis in High-SDI settings versus high lethality in Low-SDI areas. Ovarian cancer maintained the poorest prognosis in resource-limited settings. Crucially, primary risk drivers are shifting from traditional behavioral factors to metabolic factors. CONCLUSION: With disparities projected to widen by 2050, stratified interventions are urgent. We recommend screening de-escalation for High-SDI nations and resource-adapted measures for Low-to-Middle SDI nations to bridge the growing equity gap. reproductive-age women.</description>

The impact of recent interventions on prescribing habits of surgeons across different experience levels is not well understood. PURPOSE: This study measured the association between oral and maxillofacial surgeon experience (years in practice, YIP) and opioid prescribing rate to Medicare beneficiaries. It also compares prescription volume and duration across YIP groups. STUDY DESIGN/SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study used the 2022 Medicare Part D Prescribers Dataset focusing on providers with specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). PREDICTOR: The primary predictor was YIP, categorized as 0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and ≥14 years. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was opioid prescribing rate (% all annual prescriptions that were opioids). Secondary outcomes were opioid prescriptions per beneficiary and days' supply per claim. COVARIATES: These included surgeon sex and region, total Medicare beneficiaries, and beneficiary demographics (percentage female, mean age, and mean hierarchical condition category score). ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were conducted. Multiple linear regression was performed with opioid prescribing rate as the dependent variable, YIP as a continuous predictor, and surgeon/beneficiary characteristics as covariates. RESULTS: The study included 7,097 oral and maxillofacial surgeons and 563,536 opioid prescriptions to Medicare recipients. Providers with ≥14 YIP comprised of 67.1% of all prescribers but 71.7% of all opioid prescriptions. Opioid prescribing rate for 9-13 YIP and ≥14 YIP were 22.9 and 24.6%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 14.6% for 0-3 YIP (P &lt; .01). Opioid prescriptions per beneficiary and days' supply per claim were similar between YIP. In multiple linear regression, YIP was positively associated with opioid prescribing rate (b = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.39; P &lt; .01). Surgeon male sex (P &lt; .01) and practice outside the Northeast (P &lt; .01) were also associated with higher prescribing rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest potential generational differences in opioid stewardship among oral and maxillofacial surgeons treating Medicare beneficiaries. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of specific interventions on prescribing behavior.</description>

A silicone impression of the infant's nose and lip was obtained and scanned to produce an standard tessellation language (STL) file, which was processed in 3-Matics software. The conformer was designed by mirroring the normal nostril and applying a 1-mm offset, with incorporated suture holes for intraoperative fixation, and then 3D printed in polymethylmethacrylate. Following Fisher unilateral cleft lip repair, the conformer was secured in place using two 4-0 polypropylene sutures and retained for 3 months. Patients were evaluated 1 year postoperatively for symmetry. The customized conformer maintained nostril patency, improved nasal symmetry, and reduced relapse, contributing to enhanced nasolabial esthetics and stable airway support.</description>

Existing studies are limited in scope, highlighting the need for large-scale studies to clarify the prevalence and clinical relevance of these oral outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network to analyze COVID-19 patients from 2020 to 2025. Queried oral conditions, including ulcers, taste alterations, salivary disturbances, and mucosal lesions. Propensity score matching was used to balance age, sex, and comorbidities. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, with significance set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Among 4,875,258 adults with COVID-19, the most common oral outcomes were taste alteration (0.588%), aphthous ulcers (0.106%), salivary disturbances (0.053%), and stomatitis (0.025%). Compared with age, sex, and co-morbid matched controls, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of taste alteration (OR = 10.11; P &lt; .0001) and herpetic oral lesions (OR = 1.46; P &lt; .0001), while other oral conditions were less frequent. Anti-COVID-19 medication use was associated with a lower incidence of taste alteration (0.14% vs 0.54%; P &lt; .0001) and higher records of aphthous ulcers and herpetic lesions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a significantly increased risk of taste alteration and herpetic oral lesions, while anti-COVID-19 medication use is associated with lower odds of taste alteration.</description>

Active learning can be variably defined, but common descriptions emphasize mutual engagement in learning by the trainee and educator rather than mere passive listening by the learner. Active learning is demonstrated and practiced through case-based learning, collaborative work, and problem solving with the result being a deep learning experience for trainees. This article reviews and advocates contemporary approaches for active learning in oral and maxillofacial surgery education. Team-based learning with interactive teaching, flipped classroom models of education, structured debriefing and feedback, simulation-based training, and peer teaching are highlighted. It is our belief that these techniques and methodologies enhance the learning environment for oral and maxillofacial surgery trainees with resultant active learning experiences for these residents, and suitable preparation for their future, independent practice of our specialty.</description>

As patients use expands, understanding the spectrum of oral adverse events (OAEs) has become essential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX research network. A 5‑year observation window identified patients prescribed anti‑TNF-α therapies. Patients with prior oral conditions, concurrent cancer therapies, or antiresorptive exposure were excluded. OAEs were categorized into xerostomia, mucosal disorders, infectious disorders, gingival hyperplasia, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Propensity score matching (1:1, age/sex) compared anti‑TNF-α users with unexposed controls. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1,645,751 individuals receiving anti‑TNF‑α therapy, OAEs were frequent, with oral lichenoid lesions (1.27%, 20,135), candidiasis (1.09%, 17,475), xerostomia (0.87%, 14,024), stomatitis (0.68%, 10,904), and oral herpes (0.39%, 6,343) most commonly observed. Less frequent events included MRONJ (0.01%, 173), gingival hyperplasia (0.02%, 285), and OSCC (0.07%, 1,074). Compared with the general population, anti‑TNF‑α therapy significantly increased the odds of most mucosal and infectious conditions (P &lt; .001), though oral lichen planus showed no association. Interestingly, OSCC exhibited an inverse association (OR = 0.75, P &lt; .0001), suggesting a potential protective effect. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of routine oral health surveillance and robust pharmacovigilance amongst patients on anti‑TNF-α therapies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Faria CAB, da Silva WR, Cavalcanti JFDS, de Sousa SS, Arantes DAC, Colares DF, de Carvalho MCM, Abreu LG, Camey LS, Barros CCDS, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.12.006'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.12.006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41654415/'&gt;41654415&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the agreement between clinical and histopathological diagnoses at 4 Brazilian universities' oral-maxillofacial pathology services. STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective study that evaluated the agreement between clinical and histopathological diagnoses in 20,005 oral and maxillofacial pathology cases from Brazilian universities over 11 years. The analysis also included information on cases where radiographic examinations were requested as complementary diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: The overall agreement rate was 67.8% (Kappa = 0.23). Most cases occurred in 2018 and 2019, decreasing significantly in 2020. Agreement was excellent for potentially malignant, epithelial, dermatological-immunological, and salivary gland lesions (Kappa &gt; 0.85) and weak for bone lesions, developmental defects, and odontogenic tumors (Kappa &lt; 0.15). Radiographic examinations were requested in 25.9% of all cases, with cystic lesions representing 78.6% of these requests. The odontogenic tumor group accounted for a small proportion of cases, and among these few cases, radiographic examinations were seldom requested (19.7%), which may have contributed to the lower agreement between clinical and histopathologic diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-histopathological agreement varied between diagnostic groups. Greater training and complementary exams are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in lesions with low agreement.</description>

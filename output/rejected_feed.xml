Here, we report a montmorillonite-based oral fermentation system (MOFS) that achieves long-lasting in-situ preparation of beneficial bioproducts for intestinal homeostasis restoration. MOFS is fabricated by loading metabolic substrates in the lamellar structure of montmorillonite via cation replacement and adsorbing the substrate-related bacteria through electrostatic interactions. The water-impermeable property and mucoadhesive ability of montmorillonite endow MOFS with high oral availability and extended retention in the gut. The continuous release of loaded substrates and the formation of biofilms by carried bacteria enable long-term yet efficient synthesis of beneficial metabolites in the intestine, which comprehensively improve gut microbiota composition, suppress intestinal inflammation, and increase the integrity of the gut barrier. In murine models of imbalanced intestinal homeostasis, MOFS demonstrates superior efficacies by alleviating the associated symptoms, even in comparison to clinical therapeutics.</description>

While its colonization usually begins at birth, the extent of maternal involvement in yeast transmission to their offspring, particularly across different racial groups, remains unclear. Studies have shown elevated levels of C. albicans in both mothers and children, with genetically related fungal strains, suggesting maternal transmission, but the racial component, notably higher levels in Black children, lacks thorough investigation of underlying factors. Our research aimed to address this gap by investigating how maternal and demographic factors such as socioeconomic status and oral health affect C. albicans levels in infants across Black and non-Black populations. Employing a partial linear semiparametric mixed-effects model (PLSMM) with variable selection and race-based stratification, we identified predictors that have different effects depending on the infant's race among a large pool of predictors. Through this stratified analysis, we aimed to discern crucial factors significantly contributing to C. albicans colonization while minimizing the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables. In this stratified analysis, exclusive breastfeeding ([Formula: see text]) and maternal marriage ([Formula: see text]) were significant predictors among non-Black infants, while maternal employment ([Formula: see text]) and post-delivery maternal C. albicans ([Formula: see text]) were significant among Black infants. Our findings highlighted race-specific associations between C. albicans levels in children and factors such as breastfeeding practices, marital status, maternal oral hygiene, and maternal C. albicans levels. Our study underscores the importance of race-specific considerations in understanding C. albicans colonization in infants, offering insights for tailored interventions and healthcare strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations.</description>

Despite growing attention to value integration in EFL materials, empirical studies on moral and value representation in oral English textbooks remain sparse, and learners' perspectives on value acquisition through oral instruction are underexplored-this study aims to address these gaps. The study employed a mixed-methods approach: the researcher systematically analyzed 318 pages of New Inside Out Book 1 and Book 2 (first-year college EFL oral English textbooks), screening all module types including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue, listening, reading, writing, and exercise for value-related content, which was then coded and recorded in Excel. Frequency statistics show the sample textbooks include 273 value-laden verbal text samples, with a Chi-Square Test revealing statistically significant differences in dimension emphasis between the two volumes. Within Martin and White's (2005) Language Appraisal Theory, qualitative textual analysis identifies the value significance of linguistic resources as a prominent feature across module types. Additionally, to gather learner feedback on the effectiveness of value education in the oral English course, an online questionnaire survey (via Wen Juan Xing platform) was administered to learners who used the selected EFL oral English textbooks for a whole academic year. The survey showed that values-based EFL instruction positively impacted morality and personal growth.</description>

In this study, we investigate the etiology and management of intraoperative flap loss. METHODS: Retrospective review between 2010 and 2024 at 6 institutions. RESULTS: There were 7423 free flaps performed with 46 instances of intraoperative flap failure (0.62%). The most common recipient subsite was oral cavity (27/46, 57%). Anterolateral thigh (ALT) was the most common flap type to fail (18/46, 39%), followed by the fibula (15/46, 32%). The most common reasons for total failure were clotting without observable vessel abnormality (12/35, 34.3%), poor quality perforator (11/35, 31.4%), and vessel spasm or intimal abnormality leading to clotting (8/35, 22.9%). The most common acute management was converting to an additional free flap intraoperatively (28/46, 60.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Flap failure intraoperatively is rare. The majority of cases were acutely managed with an additional flap to provide defect coverage.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Grewal MR, Faust C, Eljamri S, Daniels K, Stapleton AL, Simons J, Pulsipher A, Smith KA, Padia R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70154'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41649224/'&gt;41649224&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Academic meetings provide opportunities for collaboration and career advancement in the national spotlight. We sought to explore sponsorship opportunities by gender by investigating committee leadership, keynote speakership, and panelist-moderator ratios from prior American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and Combined Otolaryngology Sections Meeting (COSM) conferences. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional review of publicly available program conferencing. SETTING: Literature review. METHODS: Gender breakdowns of committee leadership and keynote speakerships were recorded from official AAO-HNS conference programming from 2013 to 2021. Panelist-moderator gender ratios were calculated for the AAO-HNS conferences from 2023 to 2024. Society leadership representation and panelist-moderator gender ratios were also investigated from recent COSM conferences between 2018 and 2024 via official programming. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2021, analyses of the AAO-HNS national conferences determined that women comprised on average of 29.6% of annual directorship roles (range 12.5-37.55), 35.6% of board member positions (26.3%-47.4%), and 25.2% of keynote speaker appointments (0%-40%). Between 2019 and 2023, in COSM, women held on average 23.3% of available society chair/secretary positions and 19.0% of society president roles. The ratio of female:total panelist was positively correlated with female moderators. CONCLUSION: Female representation in AAO-HNS and COSM leadership and keynote speakerships has improved over time in recent years, and appears to be on par with academic otolaryngology workforce composition. However, male moderators presenting panels at both conferences had significantly fewer female panelists versus female moderators. This difference in national panel participation opportunities may impact career advancement and national reputation for female otolaryngologists.</description>

We present the largest cohort to date evaluating the procedure's effectiveness and compare functional outcomes by etiology of BVFI. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive patients treated at a tertiary care center from April 2014 to 2024. All patients who underwent TCMA for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) or bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) were included. Exclusion criteria were multi-level stenosis and prior airway resection or reconstruction. We assessed rate of decannulation, Voice handicap index (VHI), dyspnea index (DI), eating assessment tool (EAT-10), and cough severity index (CSI) scores and compared outcomes by surgical indication. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included and the majority had PGS (64%). Seventy six percent of tracheostomy dependent patients were decannulated. Surgical indication did not impact time to decannulation or number of interventions required for decannulation. DI was improved at 1-month post-operation and last clinic visit (p &lt; 0.0001). DI was slightly improved for the PGS cohort at last clinic visit, compared to the BVFP cohort (p = 0.04). There were no differences in VHI, EAT-10, or CSI after surgery compared with baseline, or differences based on BVFI etiology. CONCLUSIONS: TCMA is an effective surgical intervention for BVFI that provides a reliable rate of decannulation and improves respiratory function without compromising voice or swallowing outcomes, regardless of the BVFI etiology.</description>

Here, we develop PRISM, an efficient computational framework for precise microorganism identification and decontamination from low-biomass sequencing data. PRISM achieves robust performance when benchmarked on 230 independent datasets with known true-positive and contaminant taxa. We then use PRISM to profile 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. We identify consistent microbial signatures in gastrointestinal tract, head-and-neck, and urogenital tract tumors, and sparse signal elsewhere. In pancreatic cancer, we associate microbial detection with altered host protein glycosylation pathways and greater smoking exposure. Lastly, we consider the impact of sequencing approaches on positive and negative data interpretation. Overall, PRISM improves the reliability of microbial profiling and allows leveraging of existing human genomic data for the concurrent detection of host-microbial signatures with potential molecular and clinical significance.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Altieri B, Kircher S, Herterich S, Jahn A, Teleanu MV, Lippert J, Landwehr LS, Kimpel O, Reuter M, Remde H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; ESMO open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.106030'&gt;10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.106030&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41650745/'&gt;41650745&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Genetic and epigenetic alterations can cause mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency (dMMR) leading to microsatellite instability (MSI). Although dMMR/MSI predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancers, their relevance in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the MMR system and MSI in patients with apparently sporadic ACC and explored associations with clinical characteristics and outcomes. In a subgroup, correlation between dMMR/MSI and response to ICI was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was carried out in 109 ACC tissues with molecular data. Germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) and somatic oncogenic/likely oncogenic (O/LO) MMR variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. MLH1 methylation and EPCAM deletions were assessed via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. MSI was analysed using plex PCR. RESULTS: dMMR was identified in 15 (14%) cases, mainly involving MSH6 loss (n = 9, 8.3%) either with MSH2 or alone. No significant differences were observed in hormone secretion, European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) stage, proliferation index (Ki67%), S-GRAS (Stage, Grade, Resection status, Age, Symptoms) score, progression-free survival (8 versus 14 months) and overall survival (72 versus 80 months) between patients with and without dMMR. A slightly higher frequency of other malignancies was observed in dMMR cases (27% versus 11%, P = 0.09). Ten dMMR tumours were linked to P/LP germline (n = 4, 26.7%) or O/LO somatic (n = 5, 33.6%) MMR variants or MLH1 hypermethylation (n = 1, 6.7%), but only three (20%) showed MSI. Lynch syndrome was identified in 5% of patients. Among 12 patients treated with ICIs, time to progression was similar between those with and without defective MMR (4 versus 5 months, P = 0.21). Only one of five ICI responders had a confirmed MSH6 variant. CONCLUSION: DMMR occurs in a minority of ACC, often without MSI. Although Lynch syndrome accounts for a subset of cases, dMMR is not predictive of clinical features or ICI response. Nonetheless, MMR testing remains important for identifying individuals at hereditary cancer risk.</description>

In this study, we identify a distinct subset of autoimmune LTS characterized by edema of the inferior true vocal folds that extends to the superior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, termed "infracordal stenosis." The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of infracordal stenosis and compare it to typical autoimmune-related subglottic stenosis (AI-SGS). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis evaluated by both rheumatology and otolaryngology at our institution to identify two groups: patients with infracordal stenosis and those with typical AI-SGS. Data on immunosuppressive treatments and airway dilation procedures were collected. Time to first dilation was compared between groups. RESULTS: Among 49 patients with autoimmune LTS, 11 had infracordal involvement. Six patients had isolated infracordal stenosis while five had concomitant subglottic involvement. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed longer time to first dilation in patients with infracordal involvement (median 792 vs. 44 days; p = 0.048). Four out of six patients with isolated infracordal stenosis required no dilations during their entire follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Among autoimmune LTS patients referred to rheumatology, those with infracordal involvement experienced longer time to first dilation compared to those with typical AI-SGS. These findings suggest that infracordal stenosis may represent a distinct, glucocorticoid-responsive phenotype within autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis, with implications for treatment selection and multidisciplinary care.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of children with cleft palate who were seen at a single academic center between August 2014 and April 2024 and underwent primary palatoplasty. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and the need for and number of secondary velopharyngeal surgeries were recorded. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Of 251 children who underwent primary palatoplasty, 27 (10.8%) required secondary velopharyngeal surgery. Univariate analyses revealed no association between secondary surgery and cleft type, presence of a syndrome, or timing of palatoplasty. Multivariate logistic regression controlling for race, insurance type, age at primary palatoplasty, and presence of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome revealed private insurance was associated with decreased odds of secondary velopharyngeal surgery (OR = 0.230, 95% CI: 0.069-0.765, p = 0.017), whereas Asian race was associated with increased odds (OR = 5.853, 95% CI: 1.105-30.998, p = 0.038). Among those requiring velopharyngeal surgery, 74.1% underwent one procedure and 25.9% underwent two. The presence of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome was significantly associated with needing two surgeries (p = 0.042), while female sex was associated with requiring only one surgery (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and sociodemographic factors were predictive of secondary velopharyngeal surgery following primary palatoplasty, with different risk factors associated with the need for more than one procedure. Larger studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and guide risk stratification and family counseling.</description>

Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective, but FSWs' PrEP use typically declines rapidly post-initiation in service settings. We examined a pilot individualized case management (ICM) intervention aiming to increase PrEP adherence and persistence among cisgender FSW initiating PrEP in eThekwini, South Africa. To assess pathways of intervention influence and potential effectiveness, we characterize the support participants received from the case manager (CM) and the ways in which it influenced their PrEP adherence and persistence. METHODS: FSW initiating PrEP through a non-governmental key populations program (n = 29) participated in the pilot ICM sessions for 12 weeks, as well as semi-structured, in-depth interviews (IDIs) at baseline, month 1, and month 3. We triangulated the IDIs with CM observation notes and PrEP program refill data through month 4. We coded textual data thematically, and produced narrative summaries and time-ordered matrices to summarize themes, assess changes over time, and compare participants who continued versus discontinued PrEP by month 4. We employed the "capability, opportunity, and motivation - behavior (COM-B)" system in interpreting the pathways through which the CM's support influenced participants' PrEP adherence and persistence and considering potential intervention enhancements. RESULTS: The CM provided emotional, instrumental, and informational support that positively influenced participants' PrEP use capability, opportunity, and motivation. She bolstered participants' PrEP use capability by providing reminder tools and information to manage side effects and dispel misunderstanding; opportunity by helping strategize covert PrEP use in the face of stigma, and directly resolving pill access problems stemming from mobility and housing insecurity; and motivation by providing care and accompaniment. Experiences of care, accompaniment, and other emotional support from the CM were deeply felt in context of sex work stigma, and more prominent in the narratives of participants continuing PrEP at month 4 (20/29; 69%) versus those who discontinued. Still, 31% (9/29) of participants discontinued PrEP, and key influential forms of CM support required her ongoing presence. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest both pathways of potential ICM effectiveness and impact and sustainability shortfalls, calling for larger-scale evaluation and complementary structural approaches, such as those bolstering FSW social cohesion and tackling socio-economic barriers.</description>

METHODS: The data were obtained from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 50 and older. The outcome measured was the perception of discrimination in five different settings. The main explanatory variables were self-identified/self-perceived race (Whites and Non-whites) and gender, while covariates included education level, equivalized per capita income, depression, and the use of dental prostheses. Negative binomial and logistic regressions with interaction terms between race, gender and severe tooth loss were used to estimate the intersections between gender and race-related perceived discrimination inequities. RESULTS: The analytical sample comprised 8,556 respondents with complete variables. While the prevalence of perceived discrimination in white Brazilians was 14.3% (95%CI: 12.2;16.3), it was 18.8% (95%CI: 16.8;20.6) among non-Whites. The interaction of being female, non-white and with severe tooth loss showed higher chances of perceived discrimination in 50-59 years [RR = 1.53(95%CI: 1.01;2.28)]. Moreover, being non-white with severe loss in 60-69 years [RR = 1.74(95%CI: 1.13;2.69)] had higher chances of perceived discrimination adjusted by all covariates. A sensitivity analysis of all older adults confirmed the findings. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the intersection between severe tooth loss, race, and gender, with more pronounced associations among women and non-white individuals. These results reinforce the importance of equity-oriented oral health policies and interventions within the Family Health Strategy, particularly for populations experiencing severe tooth loss.</description>

Given the analgesic potential of music and the underlying crosstalk between auditory and nociceptive pathways, this study aims to delineate the neural circuits interfacing auditory processing and visceral pain modulation. Using a mouse model of early-life stress, we identify a cortico-cortical circuit linking the primary auditory cortex (Au1) to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that mediates stress-induced visceral pain. Mechanistically, early-life stress suppresses the activity of Au1 inhibitory (GABAergic, Au1GABA) neurons, which disinhibits downstream ACC excitatory (glutamatergic, ACCGlu) neurons, thereby driving visceral hypersensitivity. Notably, music intervention alleviates visceral pain by restoring Au1GABA neuronal activity and suppressing ACCGlu activity. In conclusion, this study unveils the Au1-ACC circuit as a critical hub for stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity and music-induced analgesia, providing a mechanistic foundation for clinical translation of music therapy in visceral pain management.</description>

DESIGN: Cross sectional population based study. SETTING: Four urban and three rural communities in Hubei Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3068 women aged 20-54 years with regular menstrual cycles, enrolled between September 2021 and January 2025. INTERVENTIONS: HPV testing using minipad collected menstrual blood, clinician collected cervical samples, and ThinPrep cytology. Women who tested HPV positive by either collection method or by cytology (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse) were referred for colposcopy directed biopsy sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnostic accuracy for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+. RESULTS: Among 3068 participants, minipad based HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% confidence interval 80.9% to 99.1%) for CIN2+ detection, comparable to clinician based HPV testing (92.1%, 77.5% to 97.9%; P=1.00). Although minipad HPV testing showed a lower specificity than clinician HPV testing (89.1%, 88.0% to 90.2% v 90.0%, 88.9% to 91.1%; P=0.001), the negative predictive value matched that of clinician HPV testing (99.9%, 99.7% to 100.0% v 99.9%, 99.7% to 100.0%; P=1.00). Both collection methods had a similar positive predictive value (9.9%, 7.1% to 13.5% v 10.4%, 7.4% to 14.3%; P=0.82) and screening efficiency (10.1 v 9.6 referrals per CIN2+ detected; P=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Minipad collected menstrual blood showed comparable diagnostic accuracy to clinician collected cervical samples for HPV testing for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+.

In this study, we developed a computational model integrating blood pressure regulation and Ca2+-Mg2+ homeostasis in a male rat. We simulated various conditions, including hypertension, Ca2+, Mg2+, and vitamin D3 deficiencies, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Simulations of hypertension, induced by various stimuli like increased renin or aldosterone secretion, demonstrated significant effects on parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, renal Ca2+/Mg2+ handling, and bone resorption. Dietary Ca2+, Mg2+, and vitamin D3 deficiencies was predicted to elevate mean arterial pressure, with Mg2+ deficiency having a stronger effect. Furthermore, the model predicted that primary hyperparathyroidism elevates PTH, Ca2+, and calcitriol, leading to increased mean arterial pressure and bone loss. Overall, this model provides valuable insights into the mechanistic links between blood pressure regulation and Ca2+-Mg2+ homeostasis, offering insights into clinical conditions like hypertension and hyperparathyroidism.</description>

Of all the causes of AIP, iron deficiency anaemia is the commonest, accounting for approximately half of cases. While oral iron treatment is standard according to the WHO recommendation, poor adherence is a concern. Intravenous (IV) iron is an alternative treatment, especially in cases where oral iron is challenging to utilise. However, this intervention is yet to be integrated into routine antenatal care. This study aimed to assess skilled health personnels' (SHPs) perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of IV iron in managing AIP in Lagos and Kano based on SHP characteristics and changes over time. METHODS: This was a repeated cross-sectional study embedded within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 11 healthcare facilities in Lagos and Kano states, Nigeria. All SHPs trained in implementing IV iron were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using the Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention measure (AIM and FIM) survey tools between the RCT baseline in August 2021 and the endline in May 2023. Analysis was done using descriptive statistics, independent and Paired T-tests and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Stata. RESULTS: Of the 60 SHPs invited at baseline (pre-implementation), 53 (88%) completed the survey. At endline (post-implementation), 39 of the 46 SHPs involved in IV iron implementation responded (85%). When comparing groups, baseline AIM scores differed significantly by state (p = 0.001), though this was not sustained at endline. No other significant differences were seen by cadre or facility for AIM, and FIM did not differ significantly by state, cadre, or facility at either time point. Among the 20 SHPs who completed both surveys, the AIM score increased from baseline 16.8/20 (Standard deviation, SD = 2.0) to endline (18.5, SD = 2.0) (p = 0.002). FIM scores also increased over time, 17.1/20 (SD = 2.3) versus 18.2/20 (SD = 1.7) (p = 0.088). CONCLUSION: Post-implementation, IV iron was perceived as highly acceptable and feasible with no differences across cadre, state, or facility levels. While acceptability significantly improved over time, feasibility also increased, though not statistically significantly at the 0.05 level.</description>

Although several temperament assessments exist, many rely on subjective evaluations, highlighting the need for scientifically validated methods. This study evaluated the validity of the Wesen temperament test by examining its association with physiological biomarkers-salivary cortisol and serotonin. Twenty-four dogs (11 females and 13 males) completed a modified Wesen test comprising seven subtests: Unconscious Confidence, Sociality, Noise Stability, Movement Stability, Desire for Play and Predation, Behavior in Stressful Situations, and Separation. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-assessment, and cortisol and serotonin concentrations were measured using ELISA. Hormonal concentrations and temperament scores were analyzed using correlation, regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pre-assessment cortisol concentrations were negatively correlated with total average temperament score and several subtest scores. Post-assessment cortisol concentrations showed significant negative correlations with total average scores and all subtests. Changes in cortisol concentrations from pre- to post-assessment were negatively associated with temperament scores. Dogs with higher temperament scores exhibited significantly higher serotonin concentrations than those with lower scores. These results support the utility of temperament assessments validated through physiological markers and provide novel evidence linking canine temperament with endocrine function.</description>

This study evaluated head and neck free flap outcomes in patients on baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis regimens. METHODS: Patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction at a single tertiary, academic institution were included. Patients were grouped according to baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis regimens. The primary outcome was overall complication rate, while secondary outcomes included flap compromise, flap failure, bleeding, venous thrombotic events, and arterial thrombotic events. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test and risk ratio (RR) regression analysis, using propensity score-adjusted models. RESULTS: Of 470 patients, 16.6% experienced postoperative complications. Longer preoperative holds (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 0.04) and delayed resumption of baseline blood thinners (OR = 1.56, p = 0.04) were associated with increased complication risk, particularly flap compromise. Unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates compared to sequential compression devices (RR = 3.10, p = 0.018) and low molecular weight heparin (RR = 2.79, p &lt; 0.001) for DVT prophylaxis. No other perioperative blood thinner regimens were significantly associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Most regimens, including baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis, can be managed safely in the perioperative period. However, unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates than other DVT prophylaxis regimens. While baseline blood thinners did not increase most complications, prolonged preoperative holding and delayed resumption may jeopardize flap viability-highlighting a modifiable point of intervention.</description>

It can lead to incoordination and weakness of the swallowing muscles, causing difficulty with swallowing. OBJECTIVE: To assess swallowing difficulty, swallowing anxiety, laryngeal function, and water swallowing performance in TII-DM patients. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. METHODS: A total of 166 elderly individuals (106 females and 78 Type-II DM) were included in the present study. Self-reported swallowing difficulty, self-reported swallowing anxiety, handgrip strength, maximum phonation time, and water swallowing performance were evaluated. RESULTS: There was a difference between the groups in terms of body mass index (BMI), self-reported swallowing difficulty, self-reported swallowing anxiety, handgrip strength, and maximum phonation time (p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.001; p &lt; 0.001; p:0.002; p:0.023, respectively) BMI, self-reported Swallowing Difficulty scores, and self-reported Swallowing Anxiety scores of elderly individuals with Type II DM were higher than those in the control group. In contrast, grip strength and maximum phonation time values were lower. There was no difference between the groups in terms of age, number of swallows, Swallowing Time, Swallow Volume, Swallow Speed, and Swallow Capacity values (p:0.727; p:0.141; p:0.933; p:0.141; p:0.277; p:0.933, respectively). CONCLUSION: Swallowing function, laryngeal function, and grip strength were found to be negatively affected in elderly individuals with TII DM compared to those without the condition. On the contrary, it was found that it did not affect water swallowing performance. Swallowing anxiety can be considered an important criterion that should be evaluated in elderly people with Type-II DM. Studies investigating solid food swallowing performance in individuals with Type-II DM, where swallowing muscle strength is more clearly required, are needed.</description>

Here, we found in human cohorts that moderate-to-high level of dietary capsaicin intake was associated with improved cognitive performance. Similarly, long-term oral capsaicin administration in male 5×FAD mice ameliorated AD-like pathologies and reshaped gut microbial composition. Gut microbiota transfer from capsaicin-treated mice produced similar effects of capsaicin intake. Moreover, capsaicin elevated the level of host 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24-HC), relating to the increase of gut Oscillibacter genus abundance. The 24-HC elevation enhanced microglial phagocytic activity in the brain, and inhibited proinflammatory factors production via liver x receptor β (LXRβ)-mediated transcriptional regulation. Finally, we observed elevation of 24-HC in plasma in AD patients with higher level of dietary capsaicin intake, which correlated with cognitive scores and plasma Aβ and p-tau biomarkers. These findings suggest the potential of capsaicin or capsaicin-rich diets in the prevention or treatment of AD and related diseases.</description>

Stigma may impede uptake and consistent use of oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). We sought to understand how stigma manifested and influenced decisions of AGYW participating in a PrEP demonstration trial in Johannesburg, South Africa and Mwanza, Tanzania. METHODS: This paper reports on serial qualitative in-depth interviews (IDI) with AGYW (n = 39) as well as healthcare providers and community stakeholders (n = 30) conducted during a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the effect of empowerment clubs to address harmful gender norms and stigma on PrEP persistence in AGYW aged 16-24 in South Africa and Tanzania. Analysis was thematic and inductive. RESULTS: Stigma manifested in two main ways: HIV-related stigma and sexual behavior stigma. PrEP was often mistaken for antiretroviral therapy, and some participants taking daily PrEP reported that partners or family members thought they were living with HIV. Anticipated PrEP sexual stigma was common and linked with concerns around AGYW being perceived as promiscuous. While most participants anticipated stigma related to PrEP use, experiences of stigma were rare and did not deter AGYW from initiating PrEP. Many participants demonstrated resilience and remained confident in their decision to use PrEP and some developed strategies to avoid stigma, such as hiding pills or taking PrEP when partners or family members were not around. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that anticipated stigma is a common yet surmountable concern of AGYW initiating PrEP in eastern and southern Africa. Future PrEP implementation should be paired with multi-level activities to reduce stigma including empowerment activities for adolescents, strategies to reduce negative attitudes among health care providers and community-wide education to raise awareness and position PrEP as a responsible choice for young people to protect their health.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Uozaki H, Kikuchi Y, Watanabe M, Tsuchiya M, Yasui M, Watabe S, Kato M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57812'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57812&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642622/'&gt;41642622&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Conventional cancer statistics account only for individuals with a clinical diagnosis, overlooking potentially large numbers of undetected malignant neoplasms. Autopsy-based studies offer a unique opportunity to estimate the burden of cancer, including latent tumors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term trends and characteristics of cancers using a nationwide autopsy registry in Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of hospital-based autopsies over a 66-year period (1958-2023) obtained data from the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan (APAC-J), a nationwide database maintained by the Japanese Society of Pathology. Latent cancers, defined as malignant neoplasms undiagnosed during life but discovered at autopsy, were analyzed based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition. All autopsies recorded in APAC-J were included. The data were analyzed between May 7 and August 2, 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the proportion of total, multiple, and latent cancers by year, age group, and sex based on trends in latent cancer detection; metastatic status of latent cancers; and the enrichment ratio in autopsy, a novel metric comparing cancer prevalence in autopsies with national mortality statistics. RESULTS: From 1958 to 2023, 1 486 557 autopsies were registered in APAC-J (mean age based on available age group data, 59.1 years; 62.5% male), with 55.2% including cancer diagnoses. The proportion of multiple primary cancers increased from 1.8% (420 of 22 989) in 1974 to 14.4% (957 of 6661) in 2023. The enrichment ratio in autopsy was elevated in adolescents (aged 15-19 years), young adults (aged 20-24 years), and adults aged 80 years or older. Since 1986, 36 133 latent cancers were found in 34 174 of 811 159 autopsies (4.2%). The detection rate of latent cancers increased from 1.7% (683 of 39 839) in 1986 to 7.4% (493 of 6661) in 2023. Latent prostate cancer at age 75 to 79 years was identified in 4.5% (corresponding to a 2017-2021 prevalence of 656.2 per 100 000 population), 6.9-fold higher than the clinical incidence, whereas latent thyroid cancer at age 50 to 54 years showed substantially larger excesses (0.9% of men and 1.7% of women, representing 94.5-fold and 60.7-fold higher prevalences, respectively). Overall, metastases were present in 7.3% of latent cancers (2649 of 36 133). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of autopsies across Japan found a substantial reservoir of undiagnosed cancer, including some with metastatic potential. These findings highlight the persistent value of autopsy for assessing cancer burden and underscore the need to refine approaches for early detection while minimizing overdiagnosis.</description>

METHODS: Prior work developed and validated 16 head and neck reference plans, based on established international dosimetry audits for intensity modulated radiotherapy treatments. Realistic modifications, developed from reported variations in clinical practice, were introduced into nine copies of each plan, generating 144 modified plans. These plans were grouped as acceptable (should pass) and unacceptable (should fail) using plan assessment metrics and action limits on CTVmean, CTVD95, and OARD0.03cc. In the current work, each GHG audit system measured the error-free reference plans on its own phantom using its standard workflow. The measured error-free plans were then compared to the dose calculations of the modified plans. Outcomes were expressed as pass/fail, which were then compared to the "should pass/should fail" benchmark to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each system. An optimal action limit was determined for each audit system to achieve a common sensitivity across all audit systems. RESULTS: All audit systems reliably identified failing plans (sensitivity 0.92-1.0; specificity 0.40-0.91) with 5% ΔCTVmean assessment action thresholds. Adjusting the action limit revealed that each audit system was tuned to detect different error thresholds (3.3% - 5.7%). Changing audit system action limits specificity, while preserving system sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The comparably high sensitivity across all audit systems could allow harmonising of dosimetry audits for clinical trials on an international scale based on sensitivity alone. Future work harmonising specificity would help streamline credentialing for international clinical trials.</description>

However, this could result in insufficient lowering of DOAC levels that could increase bleeding risk. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of patients with elevated DOAC levels at the time of elective surgery, evaluate factors associated with DOAC levels, and examine associated blood loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (DOAC Level Prior to Incision [DALI]) assessed adult patients prescribed a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) for any indication and at any dose, undergoing an elective procedure requiring DOAC interruption between May 27, 2018, and February 25, 2024, at 2 Dutch hospitals. EXPOSURE: Standardized interruption protocol (1 day before moderate- and 2 days before high bleeding-risk procedures) with interruption adjustments for the patient's kidney function. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood was drawn immediately before surgery to determine DOAC levels (by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Proportions of preoperative DOAC levels of 30 ng/mL or higher and their 95% CIs were estimated, stratified by DOAC type and surgical bleeding risk. Factors associated with DOAC levels were identified through multivariable linear regression. Surgical blood loss and 30-day postoperative complications were described according to DOAC concentrations. RESULTS: The study was terminated after including 257 patients (100 receiving apixaban, 100 receiving rivaroxaban, and 57 receiving dabigatran due to the slow inclusion rate of those receiving dabigatran; median [IQR] age, 72 [66-78] years; 173 male [67%]); 212 patients (82%) underwent a high bleeding-risk operation. Preprocedural DOAC levels were 30 ng/mL or higher in 7.6% (95% CI, 4.9%-11.6%) of patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban had similar proportions, whereas 13.1% (95% CI, 7.8%-21.2%) of patients treated with apixaban had levels of 30 ng/mL or higher. Treatment with apixaban, decreased kidney function, and a shorter interruption time were associated with higher levels. Surgical blood loss (median [range], 0 [0-4250] mL) was not associated with DOAC levels. Twelve patients (4.7%; 95% CI, 2.7%-8.0%), who all had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, experienced major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, most patients following the current protocol had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, although the proportion of patients with elevated levels was higher for apixaban. Preoperative DOAC levels were not associated with blood loss during surgery.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tang VFY, Jiang D, Kwok JYY, Yeung DY, Choi NG, Warner LM, Ho RTH, Chou KL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57170'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41637070/'&gt;41637070&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Late-life loneliness is a serious public health concern, yet the long-term efficacy and mechanisms of interventions to alleviate it remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 12-month effectiveness of lay counselor-delivered, telephone-based behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions in reducing loneliness and enhancing well-being among at-risk older adults and to examine whether social isolation mediates these effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Helping Alleviate Loneliness in Hong Kong Older Adults (HEAL-HOA) was a 3-arm, assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1, 2021, to April 28, 2024. Eligible participants 65 years or older who were living alone, digitally excluded, lonely, and experiencing financial hardship were recruited from public housing estates, community centers, academies for older adults, and word of mouth. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive telephone-delivered behavioral activation (Tele-BA), telephone-delivered mindfulness (Tele-MF), or telephone-delivered befriending (Tele-BF [attention control]). INTERVENTIONS: Participants received eight 30-minute sessions delivered by trained lay counselors via telephone for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGL). Secondary outcomes included perceived stress, social support, sleep quality, life satisfaction, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychological well-being. Social isolation was examined as a mediator. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 4152 individuals screened, 1151 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.6 [7.8] years; 843 [73.2%] female; 965 [83.8%] with ≥1 chronic illness) were randomized (Tele-BA, 335 [29.1%]; Tele-MF, 460 [40.0%]; Tele-BF, 356 [30.9%]). Intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed-effects models showed significant between-group changes in loneliness at 12 months for Tele-BA (UCLA-LS: mean difference [MD], -0.73; 95% CI, -1.29 to -0.16; P = .01; DJGL: MD, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.03; P = .01) and Tele-MF (UCLA-LS: MD, -0.72; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.20; P = .003) compared with Tele-BF. Secondary outcomes, including sleep quality, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction, also improved significantly. Social isolation at 6 months partially mediated the effect on loneliness (UCLA-LS) for both interventions at 12 months (accounting for 0.13 [13.5%] and 0.18 [18.0%] of the total effects for Tele-BA and Tele-MF, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, brief telephone-delivered behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions by lay counselors sustainably reduced loneliness and enhanced well-being during 12 months in at-risk older adults, with social isolation as a partial mediator. These scalable interventions offered effective solutions for combating late-life loneliness. Future research should investigate the applicability of these interventions outside the Hong Kong context as well as their cost-effectiveness.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rivas Velarde M, Izquierdo Martinez LC, Dalal J, Martinez-R A, Guevara Rojas KL, Parra Valero NA, Cruz Reyes DL, Cuculick J, Vallejo-Silva A, Irreño-Sotomonte J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57189'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57189&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41637069/'&gt;41637069&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Current interpretation services for Deaf patients who use sign language are often ineffective or unacceptable. In-person interpretation is frequently unavailable, and while video remote interpreting (VRI) remains underused, its scalability may be a solution given interpreter shortages and cost barriers. Existing research focuses on user and interpreter preferences, leaving a critical gap in understanding how interpretation formats affect communication quality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of VRI in improving communication outcomes between Deaf patients and physicians compared with usual communication tools, such as self-arranging interpretation, lip-reading, note-taking, and the use of images. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Colombia at a public hospital from August 2023 to October 2024, involving Deaf adults who use Colombian Sign Language as their primary language. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group. The data were analyzed between January and May 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into 2 groups: an intervention group that received a medical appointment via VRI and a control group that received one via the current standard of communication. Both the Deaf participants and the health care professionals were blinded to the allocation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An assessment of communication using the Doctor-Patient Communication scale. RESULTS: Data were collected from 210 Deaf participants, including 123 (58.6%) women and 87 (41.4%) men, with a mean (SD) age of 42 (13) years (range, 18-84 years). Overall, 108 participants (51.4%) reported using VRI. The intervention revealed that having VRI did not always result in improved communication between Deaf individuals and physicians. While those using VRI were more likely to report positive outcomes in certain areas, such as being encouraged to express themselves (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13-3.18; P = .02), there was no difference in other areas, such as understanding the doctor (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.79-2.23; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of VRI in the health care context, some aspects of clinical communication were improved, but others were not. This suggests that critical preconditions have to be met for this technology to achieve its intended impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05966623.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kim JH, Hwang IS, Lee SJ, Kim CJ, Lee SJ, Han K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56840'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56840&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41632476/'&gt;41632476&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Reproductive factors are associated with ovarian cancer risk, but their influence may differ across menopausal status and birth cohorts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between reproductive factors and ovarian cancer risk stratified by menopausal status and birth cohort. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This nationwide population-based cohort study obtained data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS), a single-payer system covering 97% of the population in South Korea. Women aged 40 years or older who underwent NHIS health screening in 2009 and had reproductive, clinical, and other data were included and followed up until ovarian cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2022. Data were analyzed in March 2025. EXPOSURES: Age at menarche, parity, breastfeeding duration, oral contraceptive use, age at menopause, total reproductive span, and hormone replacement therapy use. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident ovarian cancer identified from NHIS claims with International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes C56, C57, and C48 and confirmed through the Rare/Intractable Disease Registry (code V193). Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: A total of 2 285 774 women (932 637 [40.8%] premenopausal, 1 353 137 [59.2%] postmenopausal; mean [SD] age, 54.9 [10.85] years) were included in the final analytic cohort. The mean (SD) follow-up duration overall was 10.7 (2.99) years, and 10 729 ovarian cancer cases were identified during follow-up. Early menarche (aged ≤12 vs &gt;16 years) was associated with higher ovarian cancer risk in both premenopausal women (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.16-1.61) and postmenopausal women (HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54). Parity of 2 or more births was associated with lower risk in both groups (HR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.58-0.79] and 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60-0.85]). Breastfeeding for 12 months or longer and oral contraceptive use for 1 year or longer were associated with lower risk in premenopausal women but not postmenopausal women (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77-0.96] and 0.75 [95% CI, 0.61-0.93]). Among postmenopausal women, later menopause (at age ≥55 years; HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.11-1.66]), longer reproductive span (≥40 years; HR, 1.21 [95% CI, 1.09-1.34]), and hormone replacement therapy use for 2 to 5 years (HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.07-1.34]) were associated with higher risk. Parity-related risk reduction was attenuated in the 1960s birth cohort (HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.52-2.19; P for interaction = .36). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that reproductive factors were associated with ovarian cancer risk, with distinct patterns across menopausal status and birth cohorts. These findings highlight the need for tailored prevention strategies in aging, low-fertility populations.</description>

While sialometry is the reference method for diagnosing hyposalivation, it is challenging to use in dependent patients or those with cognitive impairments. This study aimed to test a new tool, FishburneTabs (FBTs), by comparing it with sialometry and evaluating its concordance with the Clinical Oral Dryness Score (CODS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study compared three different techniques for assessing hyposalivation in 59 patients (care home residents): CODS evaluation, saliva collection using FBTs, and stimulated salivary flow sialometry. RESULTS: Positive correlations were identified between FBTs and salivary flow measurements (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.05), and negative correlations between CODS and both FBTs (r = -0.51, p &lt; 0.05) and salivary flow (r = -0.62, p &lt; 0.05). The sensitivity and specificity of FBTs for identifying hyposalivation were 62.2% and 61.9%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 74.2% and a negative predictive value of 48.1%. CONCLUSION: FBTs show promise as a supportive tool for assessing hyposalivation in settings where sialometry is not feasible, although they are not a direct substitute for sialometry as the reference method.</description>

We evaluated the effects of a 12-month antimicrobial stewardship program at a university-affiliated hospital in Japan during antimicrobial shortages. In this single-center retrospective observational study, from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2025, we compared the pre-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program without infectious disease specialists) and post-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program with infectious disease specialists and formal consultation service) periods. The evaluated outcomes included antimicrobial use, microbiological indicators (number of culture specimens submitted and hospital-acquired resistant organisms), patient outcomes (in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay), and antimicrobial costs. A Bayesian structural time-series analysis adjusted for seasonality was used to assess intervention effects. In total, 24,601 inpatients were included (11,782 before intervention and 12,819 after). Shortages affected nine intravenous and two oral antibiotics. The antimicrobial stewardship program team provided 1110 feedback instances (acceptance rate, 74.1%) and conducted 172 infectious disease consultations in the post-intervention period. Carbapenem use, antipseudomonal agent use, incidence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the cost of carbapenems per patient-day significantly decreased. Narrow-spectrum antibiotic use, anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agent use, all intravenous antimicrobial use, total intravenous and oral antimicrobials, and the number of inpatient specimens were significantly increased. All antimicrobial costs, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay remained unchanged. Antimicrobial stewardship program supported by infectious disease specialists/consultants significantly reduced carbapenem and antipseudomonal agent use without negatively affecting patient outcomes. These findings highlight infectious disease specialists' critical role in supporting effective antimicrobial stewardship programs, particularly during limited antimicrobial supply and increased clinical complexity.</description>

METHODS: We performed a single center, randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2020-001852-16) in which patients with severe covid-19 in need of hospitalization were randomized in two groups. The first group received 12.5 mg oral iodine for 8 days, the second group did not receive iodine next to the standard of care. Primary endpoints were deterioration of disease defined as transfer from the ward to the intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Next to these parameters we collected parameters in line with the recommendations made by the WHO in the early days of the pandemic. On these additional datasets we performed an exploratory analysis and investigated possible confounders and trends. The inclusion phase of the study was between October 2020 and April 2022. Finally, in vitro validations were performed. RESULTS: Outcomes from 141 participants were analyzed, revealing no significant differences in mortality or transfers to intensive care between the iodine-treated group (67 patients) and the control group (74 patients). In an exploratory analysis we found that patients randomized to receive oral iodine had a significantly shorter stay at the ICU (p = 0.016). In vitro validations proved increased virus-induced type I interferon responses upon iodine administration in pulmonary cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that while iodine does not reduce mortality or ICU admissions, it may enhance antiviral immunity through increased type I interferon responses, contributing to shorter ICU stays in COVID-19 patients. The role of iodine in enhancing IFN-I mediated antiviral immunity warrants future research.

All data on severe periodontitis used in this study were derived from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Annual years lived with disability (YLDs) and their estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated and stratified by year, age, geographical region, and socio-demographic index (SDI) at global, regional, and national levels. Decomposition analysis assessed the contributions of demographic and epidemiological factors to the evolving burden of severe periodontitis. A frontier analysis identified areas for improvement and disparities among countries based on development levels. Distributional inequalities were measured using the slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index. The autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) was used to project the disease burden up to 2036. In 2021, there were 6,903.28 thousand YLDs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2,772.28-14,106.18 thousand) attributed to severe periodontitis globally. Between 1990 and 2021, the global age-standardized rate (ASR) of YLDs showed a stable trend, increasing slightly from 79.62 (95% UI: 31.46-169.62) to 80.89 (95% UI: 32.47-165.37) with an EAPC of 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.03 to 0.18). Population growth accounted for 66.73% of the global increase in YLDs. SII values rose from 12.72 (95% CI: 1.92-23.52) in 1990 to 44.99 (95% CI: 31.14-58.85) in 2021, while the concentration index decreased from 0.05 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.13) in 1990 to 0.035 (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.13). According to the forecasts, the global ASR of YLDs for severe periodontitis is projected to show a slight decline over the next 15 years. Significant potential exists for reducing the burden of severe periodontitis across countries, irrespective of their development levels. Severe periodontitis remains a significant global health challenge, with substantial cross-country disparities that persist despite overall stable trends in global YLDs. Targeted interventions and policies are urgently needed to address these disparities, focusing on improving oral health outcomes across all countries, regardless of their socio-demographic development levels.</description>

Evidence from LMICs indicates that intravenous (IV) iron formulations such as ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) are safe and effective alternatives to oral iron, and there is emerging data on implementation strategies and outcomes. Client outcomes are important additional considerations for successful scale-up of new interventions. We assessed patient experiences and satisfaction among women receiving IV versus oral iron for anaemia in pregnancy in Nigeria. METHODS: This mixed-methods study was nested in a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial that enrolled 1,056 pregnant women at 20-32 weeks gestational age. Participants were randomised to receive either FCM or oral ferrous sulphate (FS). Twenty-five percent of participants were sequentially sampled for interviewer-administered exit surveys and 66 women who received IV iron were purposively selected for in-depth interviews at last study visit. Quantitative data from the two treatment groups were evaluated using the Chi-squared test, while qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: We surveyed 252 women (128 treated with FCM and 124 with FS). Significantly higher proportions of the FCM (73.4%) versus FS group (57.3%) had positive perceptions of care (p = 0.007). Positive perceptions, experiences and satisfaction with FCM were buttressed by the qualitative findings, for reasons such as good communication and quality of provider care, single-dose administration, minimal side effects, positive health outcomes and not bearing treatment costs. CONCLUSION: Participants in this IV versus oral iron trial had positive perceptions of FCM. These patient-reported findings support available evidence on service and implementation outcomes and further support IV iron scale up in LMIC settings. Future implementation research should further assess client outcomes under real-world conditions.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective dataset of 12,742 annotated frames from 55 laryngoscopy video recordings was annotated with bounding boxes identifying vocal fold polyps. Pretrained YOLO11 and YOLO12 models were fine-tuned to detect the polyps in the frames. A temporal tracking algorithm was further developed to propagate missed detections across adjacent frames. RESULTS: YOLO12 outperformed YOLO11 across all metrics. On the hold-out test set, YOLO12 reached a precision of 83.1% and an F1 score of 67.6%, with a mean average precision at 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 64.1%. By comparison, YOLO11 achieved a precision of 67.3% and an F1 score of 56.2%, with a mAP@0.5 of 56.0%. Incorporating temporal tracking increased mAP@0.5 to 70.4% with YOLO 12, while maintaining a detection speed of 21.4 frames per second (fps), close to real time (30 fps). CONCLUSIONS: Using YOLO 12 for vocal fold polyp detection in stroboscopy was enhanced with temporal tracking, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 70.4% with near real time performance. These results demonstrate the potential of real-time AI-assisted detection of vocal fold lesions.</description>

METHODS: Patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with either FFF, MSAP, or ALT were included. The primary outcome was functional recovery, assessed using the modified LEFS, a PROM measuring functional status, administered at multiple post-operative timepoints. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in the analysis: 33 FFF, 22 MSAP and 20 ALT. Patients undergoing lower extremity free flap surgery overall recovered well. The LEFS scores at different time points demonstrated quicker recovery for the MSAP group, while ALT and FFF recovered later. After 360 days, the MSAP group also demonstrated improved functional outcomes compared to the ALT and FFF. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing lower extremity free flap surgery recover well. The MSAP had the least donor-site morbidity. Donor-site morbidity should be considered when counseling patients.</description>

However, the rapid rise of influencer-style content, informal consultations, and curated before-after posts raises critical concerns regarding professionalism, patient privacy, and clinical accuracy. This perspective explores how social media can serve as a tool, a trap, or a trophy cabinet in surgical practice, urging the need for clear institutional guidelines and ethical boundaries. With the profession's credibility at stake, oral surgeons must lead the conversation on responsible digital engagement.</description>

This study assessed the readiness of oncology RWD from Saudi health care centers for standardization and evaluated their completeness and accuracy. METHODS: Deidentified electronic health records for adult patients (18 years and older) diagnosed with breast cancer, thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, or renal cell carcinoma were extracted from five health care centers within the Saudi Real-World Evidence Network. Readiness for standardization was evaluated by assessing alignment with data elements in the Minimal Common Oncology Data Elements (mCODE) framework, a standardized and clinically focused oncology data model. Data quality was evaluated using two dimensions: completeness, defined as the proportion of patients with at least one entered value for each element; and accuracy, defined as the proportion of correct entries based on verification checks (including plausibility and consistency). Outcomes were calculated at the element level and weighted to generate domain- and center-level proportions. RESULTS: A total of 20,671 oncology patients were included. Overall weighted alignment with mCODE domains was moderate (62.43%). The patient domain showed the highest alignment (71.43%), whereas the outcome domain exhibited significant gaps. Data completeness was low to moderate (49.02%), with higher levels in common cancers (54.33%) than in rare cancers (51.50%). Data accuracy was high overall (95.03%), with rare cancers showing higher accuracy (98.76%) than common cancers (94.62%). CONCLUSION: Saudi oncology RWD show moderate alignment with mCODE, with consistently high accuracy across domains. However, gaps in data completeness highlight the need for broader adoption of standardized data frameworks to support interoperability and enable nationwide research and regulatory use.</description>

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 69 patients (78.3% male) from two Chinese hospitals assessed ulcer characteristics, pain (VAS), micronutrient levels, and psychological scores (SCARED, DSRSC, CPRS, SDQ). Statistical analysis used nonparametric tests and correlation analysis (SPSS 26.0). RESULTS: Zinc deficiency (37.7%) correlated with longer disease duration (12.0 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.035) and shorter ulcer-free intervals (60.0 vs. 95.2 days, p = 0.040). Zinc levels inversely linked to emotional symptoms (r = -0.416, p = 0.022) but positively to prosocial behavior (r = 0.526, p = 0.003). Pain intensity associated with anxiety (VAS: 4.0 vs. 3.0, p = 0.025) and psychosocial distress (r = 0.461, p = 0.010). Older children (8-16 years) had longer disease duration (12.0 vs. 3.6 months, p &lt; 0.001) and higher zinc deficiency (47.5% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.048). Iron showed paradoxical associations with emotional symptoms (r = 0.452, p = 0.012) and prosocial behavior (r = -0.382, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Zinc deficiency and psychological factors critically influence the chronicity of FOU. Multidisciplinary care combining micronutrient supplementation and behavioral interventions is recommended.</description>

Nowadays, newer possibilities are offered by micro-needles as an effective transmucosal drug delivery. The aim of this single-blinded randomized clinical trial was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of micro-needling (MN) as a novel technique for transmucosal delivery of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) on symptomatic OLP lesions. METHODS: Twenty volunteers with bilateral symptomatic OLP lesions were randomly assigned to the study involving four different treatment groups (G): G1, topical TA alone; G2, MN as an adjunct to the topical TA; G3, topical TA and HA; and G4, MN as an adjunct to the topical TA and HA. Lesions were assessed at baseline, and on Days 7, 14, 28, and 56 using parameters including the percentage healing index (PHI), reticulation/erythema/ulceration (REU) score, and visual analogue scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was then performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Twenty patients (40 lesions; 10 per group) were included. G4 showed a significantly higher PHI compared to both G1 (p   &lt; $$ &lt; $$  0.001) and G3 (p &lt; 0.05) at all observation times. Regarding the REU score, G4 achieved significantly greater reductions compared to G1 at all observation times (p &lt; 0.05), compared to G2 on Days 7, 28, and 56 (p &lt; 0.05), and compared to G3 on Days 28 and 56 (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding the VAS, both G2 and G4 showed a statistically significant reduction on Day 7 compared to G1 and G3 (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study uncovered the advantages of MN in promoting healing, reducing severity, and alleviating pain in OLP patients. Therefore, MN has the potential to become an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality for symptomatic OLP. Moreover, the adjunctive use of MN with topical application of both TA and HA demonstrated the most significant therapeutic benefits, suggesting a synergistic effect.

Otolaryngologic manifestations often precede systemic symptoms but are commonly misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis or infection, delaying treatment and increasing the risk of irreversible renal damage. AIM: This review aimed to characterize otolaryngologic presentations in GPA and evaluate their correlation with renal involvement to improve early recognition and clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. They searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to July 2025. They included case reports and case series that described head and neck manifestations in patients with confirmed GPA. Two reviewers independently screened 784 records, selected 17 studies, and extracted data on clinical features, ANCA status, and renal outcomes. The Murad and JBI tools assessed methodological quality. RESULTS: Nasal crusting, epistaxis, septal perforation, and saddle-nose deformity were the most frequent otolaryngologic findings. Oral lesions, including ulcerations and "strawberry gingivitis," were less common but highly suggestive. Subglottic stenosis, otitis media with effusion, and orbital inflammation also occurred. Many patients received initial misdiagnoses, leading to treatment delays. Renal involvement, primarily glomerulonephritis, developed in most systemic cases, often concurrent with or shortly after severe ENT disease. Destructive lesions correlated strongly with renal complications. PR3-ANCA positivity ranged from 21 to 100%, with most studies reporting rates above 85%. Histopathologic confirmation was achieved through biopsies of nasal or gingival tissue. Immunosuppressive therapy-controlled disease activity, while surgery managed structural sequelae. CONCLUSION: Destructive otolaryngologic manifestations predicted renal involvement in GPA. Early biopsy, ANCA testing, and multidisciplinary management improved diagnostic accuracy and prevented organ damage. Future research should develop standardized ENT activity scores and prospective registries.</description>

Although multiple surgical techniques have been developed, their long-term outcomes remain inadequately defined. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of surgical interventions used to manage CSF rhinorrhea. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from database inception to March 2025. Studies evaluating any surgical interventions for managing CSF rhinorrhea and following the patients for at least one year were included. Our study outcomes were success, recurrence, and complication rates. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 18 BE. RESULTS: Our review encompassed 114 studies involving 4187 patients with CSF rhinorrhea. The endoscopic repair demonstrated a high primary success rate, estimated at 93% (1-2 years), 92% (2-5 years), and 91% (more than 5 years). Recurrence after endoscopic repair remained low, varying from 7% to 11%. Complications were uncommon, with meningitis reported in 1-2% of cases, sinusitis estimated at 1%, and headache from 1 to 3%. The craniotomy approach achieved a high primary success rate, reaching 95% at 1-2 years, then dropping to 75% at 2-5 years, and increasing again to 98% at &gt; 5 years. Additionally, the risk of recurrence (5-22%) and complications were generally higher after craniotomy (3-6%). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic repair demonstrated excellent long-term outcomes with minimal morbidity, supporting its role as the standard approach for most CSF rhinorrhea cases. Although craniotomy carries a higher risk of recurrence and complications, it remains appropriate for complex or frontal defects. Surgical management should be individualized according to defect site, CSF flow, and patient-specific factors to optimize outcomes. Nevertheless, we have some limitations as most included studies were observational and retrospective, and there was heterogeneity in study design and outcome reporting.</description>

Due to the lack of standardized outcome parameters for diagnosing SD or assessing its treatment over time, the evaluation of systematic clinical evidence on the effects of BoNT therapy on SD symptom control is difficult. The registry presented in this article aimed to evaluate outcomes after BoNT treatment in SD patients in Austria and Germany, based on selected subjective and objective voice parameters. METHODS: 41 patients with SD were included in this multicentric registry, after drop-out of 2 patients the results of 39/41 (95.1%) patients could be analyzed per protocol. Demographic and treatment characteristics as well as the occurrence of therapy-related side effects were recorded. Perceptual voice sound evaluation (RBH scale), voice range profile measurements (VRP), number of spasms, and severity of voice strain were assessed. Patients were asked to complete the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-9i), the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB), and indicate their perceived phonation effort on a VAS scale. The parameters were compared between baseline and 1-month post-BoNT treatment. RESULTS: The patients received all BoNT type A (Xeomin®/Merz, Allergan®/Allergan or Dysport®/Ipsen). SD symptoms did not affect the frequency or dynamic range of the singing voice nor did they affect MPT; in contrast all the other parameters assessed were aberrant at baseline. BoNT treatment improved Jitter-%, Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI), degrees of roughness and hoarseness, but failed to restore them to normal. BoNT significantly reduced the voice spasm and strain. Phonation effort improved by approximately 50%. VHI-9i classification was reduced from moderate to mild after treatment, and CPIB from moderate to mild. The VHI-9i results were significantly positively correlated with the CPIB results. CONCLUSION: The results of this registry showed that BoNT injection, the current off-label treatment of SD symptoms, failed to restore normal voice quality. This registry's outcomes also indicate that the choice of the applied BoNT brand is site-specific and does not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy. We also showed that the effects of the BoNT on the SD symptoms are best described by semi-quantitative outcome measures such as spasm counts and voice strain, and by patients-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as CPIB and VHI-9i than by more objective parameters such as frequency and dynamic range of the singing voice.</description>

With the increasing use of YouTube as a source of medical information, concerns have arisen regarding the accuracy and reliability of video content on this platform. This study aimed to evaluate the quality, reliability, and usefulness of English-language YouTube videos related to AH. METHODS: A total of 300 videos were screened using specific keywords, and 93 met the inclusion criteria. Videos were assessed for their general characteristics and classified as either useful or misleading based on scientific accuracy. The Global Quality Scale (GQS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), and JAMA benchmarks were used to evaluate video quality and reliability. RESULTS: Among the included videos, 78.5% were deemed useful, while 21.5% were misleading. Videos uploaded by academic institutions and physicians demonstrated significantly higher mDISCERN, GQS, and JAMA scores (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the majority of misleading videos were uploaded by independent users. A strong correlation was found between viewer engagement metrics (likes, comments) and daily view counts (p &lt; 0.001), though higher popularity did not consistently align with higher quality or reliability. CONCLUSION: Although YouTube offers a substantial number of informative videos on AH, the presence of misleading content remains a concern, particularly from non-professional sources. Healthcare professionals and institutions are encouraged to produce high-quality, reliable video content to enhance public health literacy and counter misinformation.</description>

Senolytic drugs selectively eliminate senescent cells, offering a potential strategy to mitigate therapy-induced senescence (TIS) and improve cancer treatment outcomes. This review aimed to synthesize preclinical in vivo evidence evaluating the effects of senolytic and senogenic combination therapy on tumor burden and mechanistic outcomes, including senescence, SASP modulation, proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage markers. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 2025. Search terms included: "senolytic drugs," "cellular senescence," "senescence clearance," "therapy-induced senescence," "senomorphic drugs," "chemotherapy," "cancer treatment," "in vivo," and "xenograft," "PARP inhibitor," "CDK4/6 inhibitor," "BCL-2 inhibitor," "BH3-mimetic," and "BET inhibitor". Eligible studies included in vivo cancer models evaluating senolytic + senogenic combinations compared with the senogenic strategy alone, with outcomes related to tumor burden or mechanistic markers. Data extraction captured study design, animal model, tumor type, treatment regimen, and quantitative outcomes including senescence, SASP factors, proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for preclinical studies. RESULTS: The initial search identified 1,262 articles, of which 36 fulfilled the inclusion criteria after screening. All included studies were therapeutic mechanistic in vivo investigations. Across cancer types including colorectal, breast, ovarian, lung, melanoma, meningioma, prostate, head and neck, bladder, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinoma, senolytic co-treatment consistently reduced tumor burden compared with senogenic alone. Senescence markers such as SA-β-gal, p21, p53 and p16INK4a were decreased in the majority of combination groups, confirming attenuation of senescence-associated cell-cycle arrest. IL-6 was the most consistently suppressed SASP cytokine. Ki-67 was decreased and Caspase-3 activation increased across most models, supporting reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. BCL2 downregulation and γ-H2AX elevation were observed in several studies, further suggesting increased apoptotic activity and DNA damage. CONCLUSION: Senolytic plus senogenic combinations demonstrate robust preclinical efficacy in reducing tumor growth and senescent burden while promoting apoptosis across diverse in vivo models. These findings highlight senotherapy as a promising adjunct to conventional senescence-inducing anticancer therapies and underscore the need for standardized in vivo methodologies and translational studies to guide clinical application. This review protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD420251161998).</description>

Alternatively, mandibular preservation and wrapping with a periosteal free flap may achieve healing in selected patients. Our objective was to assess the success rate and morbidity of revascularization of mandibular ORN using a humeral periosteal free flap. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using medical records of patients who had undergone humeral periosteal free flap reconstruction for mandibular ORN. Clinical data, including age, gender, ORN site, ORN grade according to the Notani classification, clinical and radiological outcomes and complications were analyzed. The primary endpoint was ORN healing, defined as complete resolution of the main symptom (exposure, chronic infection, fistula, or fracture) at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 36 lesions in 34 patients with mandibular ORN associated with bone exposure and/or infection and/or pathologic fracture were included. ORN healing at 6 months was achieved in 64.7% (n = 22/34) of treated sites in the overall cohort and in 91.6% (n = 22/24) of patients with a viable flap. CONCLUSION: The humeral periosteal free flap can be considered a reasonable surgical option for advanced mandibular ORN to avoid segmental mandibulectomy.</description>

This prospective pilot study aims to compare nasal mucosal sensitivity to air-jet stimuli between ENS patients and patients who underwent septoplasty/turbinate reduction (septo-turb) surgery, but without ENS symptoms. METHODS: Seven ENS and seven septo-turb subjects were recruited through a sample of convenience (from 06/2023 to 09/2024) due to the rarity of ENS. A precise, 0.25 s air jet ranging from 0.5 to 5 L/min was delivered via a 25-gage microcannula, with a 0.4 × 1.6 mm side opening placed 2 mm from the mucosal surface at predetermined sites that include the medial and lateral side of the nasal valve, the head and the center of inferior turbinate and their opposing septum. Detection thresholds were determined using a single-staircase method in 0.5 L/min steps. RESULTS: The ENS group had a significantly higher (less sensitive) threshold than the septo-turb group for the septum opposing the center of the inferior turbinate (ENS: 2.43 ± 1.37 L/min; septoplasty: 1.39 ± 1.27 L/min, p = 0.016); however, not for other sites. This regional threshold significantly correlated with all self-reported symptom scores (NOSE, SNOT-22, ENS6Q, VAS) (r = 0.45-0.54, all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant regional differences in air-jet stimulus sensitivity between ENS and septoplasty patients were found that significantly correlated with symptom scores. A future larger sample size would make a more definitive conclusion.</description>

However, the characteristics that distinguish parents who are willing versus unwilling to vaccinate-particularly those who are unwilling-remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to examine the underlying reasons and attributes associated with parental willingness and unwillingness, thereby providing evidence on the classification and heterogeneity of HPV vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: In May 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey using convenience sampling among 1,331 parents of girls aged 9-14 years from seven schools in Shanghai, China. The survey collected sociodemographic characteristics, willingness to vaccinate daughters against HPV and the underlying reasons, and parental knowledge literacy regarding cervical cancer, HPV, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer screening. Two-step cluster analysis was used to classify parents based on their stated reasons for willingness or unwillingness to vaccinate. We then examined associations between parental characteristics and cluster membership. RESULTS: Among 1,076 parents of unvaccinated girls aged 9-14 years, 18.12% reported unwillingness to vaccinate. Cluster analysis identified three distinct refusal clusters, labeled as the Moderate and Hesitant type (low knowledge literacy and limited understanding of HPV-related risks), the Trust-Critical type (high knowledge literacy but low institutional trust), and the Social-Norm Sensitive type (high educational attainment and susceptibility to peer and societal influences). Significant between-cluster differences were observed in educational attainment, number of children, and knowledge literacy, indicating that vaccine refusal is structurally diverse rather than uniform. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine refusal among Chinese parents is heterogeneous and appears to be shaped by cognitive, emotional, and social factors. Tailored interventions are therefore warranted. Segmented strategies that address cluster-specific drivers may reduce vaccine hesitancy more effectively than uniform public health messaging.</description>

METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we analyzed the incidence, mortality, and DALYs of breast, ovarian, and thyroid cancers across 15 countries (1990-2021). Trends were quantified using EAPC, and mortality trajectories through 2050 were projected using GAM. RESULTS: Breast cancer exhibited a polarized pattern: mortality steadily declined in High-SDI nations but surged in Low-SDI regions. Thyroid cancer revealed a dichotomy of screening-driven overdiagnosis in High-SDI settings versus high lethality in Low-SDI areas. Ovarian cancer maintained the poorest prognosis in resource-limited settings. Crucially, primary risk drivers are shifting from traditional behavioral factors to metabolic factors. CONCLUSION: With disparities projected to widen by 2050, stratified interventions are urgent. We recommend screening de-escalation for High-SDI nations and resource-adapted measures for Low-to-Middle SDI nations to bridge the growing equity gap. reproductive-age women.</description>

METHODS: LRT proton plans were created retrospectively for 12 patients with head-and-neck, thoracic, or abdominal bulky tumors, averaging a gross tumor volume (GTV) of 1011.1 cc (between 333 cc and 3546 cc). The plans were developed in the RayStation treatment planning system (version 2023B), adhering to established consensus guidelines for prescription dose and planning goals. For each plan, 6-8 vertices with an average diameter of 1.4 cm were positioned approximately 3.5 cm apart. The prescription was 18 Gy to each vertex and 3 Gy to the GTV. Single-field optimization (SFO) and multi-field optimization (MFO) techniques were employed. The dosimetric parameters of GTV Dmean, D95%, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD a=-10), vertex D90%, peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and skin D1% were used for plan quality assessment. Plan robustness was also investigated by comparing dose metrics between the nominal and second worst-case scenarios in the robust analysis. RESULTS: For all 12 patients, both SFO and MFO plans achieved a PVDR close to 4 across the three treatment sites. No significant differences in primary dose metrics were observed between SFO and MFO plans, except for skin D1%, which was reduced by an average of 25% in the MFO plans (p&lt;0.05). Robustness evaluation indicated larger deviations in PVDR, GTV Dmean, and skin D1% between nominal and second worst-case scenarios for MFO plans compared to SFO (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Both SFO and MFO techniques can be reliably implemented with current proton beam quality standards and advanced treatment planning algorithms. While SFO offers better plan robustness in maintaining the originally optimized metrics under various treatment-related uncertainties, MFO enhances the ability to spare critical organs.</description>

METHODS: A total of 97 patients with NSCLC (30 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 67 with adenocarcinoma (AC)) were included. The parameters f1, f2, f3, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were measured and compared between the two subtypes. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors, and a combined diagnostic model was developed. The performance of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Compared with the AC group, the SCC group exhibited significantly higher SUVmax, f2, and f3 values, and lower ADC and f1 values (all P &lt; 0.05). Smoking status, f1, SUVmax, and ADC were independent predictors of NSCLC subtypes. The combined model demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.909; sensitivity = 73.33%; specificity = 89.55%) compared with individual predictors (AUC = 0.693, 0.819, 0.767, and 0.742 for smoking status, f1, SUVmax, and ADC, respectively; all P &lt; 0.01). Bootstrap resampling (1000 samples) validated the robustness of the model (AUC = 0.895). Calibration curves and DCA confirmed the model's stability and clinical utility. CONCLUSION: RSI can effectively differentiate NSCLC subtypes.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Selznick H, Lee KC, Hershberger M, Panchal N, Brandfon B, Ford BP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.006'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41628897/'&gt;41628897&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is a biologic complication of implant therapy that compromises long-term function and esthetics. With obesity rising globally, determining whether body mass index (BMI) independently contributes to peri-implantitis is critical for identifying at-risk patients and improving implant success. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between BMI and peri-implantitis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of implants placed at the Philadelphia Veterans Authority Medical Center between 2006 and 2019. Patients were included in the study if they had complete medical and dental records and a BMI recorded within 3 months of placement. Patients with systemic confounders such as bisphosphonate therapy, head and neck radiation, or incomplete data were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was BMI, which was utilized as a binary variable as either nonobese (&lt;30 kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome was time from implant placement to peri-implantitis, defined as radiographic evidence of crestal bone loss with clinical bleeding on probing, with or without suppuration. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, diabetes status, smoking history, alcohol use, implant location, and prior bone grafting. ANALYSES: Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for each predictor, and time-to-event curves were compared with log-rank tests to identify significant predictors of peri-implantitis. Multivariate analysis of significant predictors was performed using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Our database included 325 subjects who received 1,138 implants. Utilizing a subject-level analysis, 325 implants (28.6%) composed the final study sample after randomly selecting 1 implant per subject. The mean subject age was 59.3 ± 10.6 years, and 310 (95.4%) of subjects were male. Peri-implantitis occurred in 80 implants (24.6%). The 5-year peri-implantitis rates were 22.7 and 34.0% for subjects with BMI&lt;30 kg/m2 and BMI≥30 kg/m2, respectively (P = .04). In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 remained independently associated with an increased risk of peri-implantitis (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.44; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated BMI is an independent predictor of peri-implantitis. These findings emphasize the need for integrating BMI and metabolic screening into implant planning and maintenance. Recognition of obesity-related inflammatory mechanisms may improve preventive strategies and long-term implant outcomes in clinical practice.</description>

Existing studies are limited in scope, highlighting the need for large-scale studies to clarify the prevalence and clinical relevance of these oral outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network to analyze COVID-19 patients from 2020 to 2025. Queried oral conditions, including ulcers, taste alterations, salivary disturbances, and mucosal lesions. Propensity score matching was used to balance age, sex, and comorbidities. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, with significance set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Among 4,875,258 adults with COVID-19, the most common oral outcomes were taste alteration (0.588%), aphthous ulcers (0.106%), salivary disturbances (0.053%), and stomatitis (0.025%). Compared with age, sex, and co-morbid matched controls, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of taste alteration (OR = 10.11; P &lt; .0001) and herpetic oral lesions (OR = 1.46; P &lt; .0001), while other oral conditions were less frequent. Anti-COVID-19 medication use was associated with a lower incidence of taste alteration (0.14% vs 0.54%; P &lt; .0001) and higher records of aphthous ulcers and herpetic lesions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a significantly increased risk of taste alteration and herpetic oral lesions, while anti-COVID-19 medication use is associated with lower odds of taste alteration.</description>

With the increasing use of minimally invasive biopsy techniques, understanding the relationship between OP and lung cancer is critical to avoid delayed or missed diagnoses. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of OP and lung malignancy and report characteristics of these cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all lung pathology reports at Indiana University from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2023, encompassing over 8,000 cases. Cases with histopathologic diagnoses of OP with and without lung malignancy were identified; relevant clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data were extracted. Using language extraction, we identified pathology cases showing both organizing pneumonia and carcinoma (Cohort 1) and transbronchial biopsies identified as "organizing pneumonia" (Cohort 2). Cohort 2 was selected to reflect current clinical practice. RESULTS: In Cohort 1 (n=57), 88% of samples demonstrating both organizing pneumonia and malignancy were obtained via surgical resection. Among these, squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 46% and adenocarcinoma for 37% of cases, with all T-stages represented (44% T1, 29% T2, 16% T3, and 11% T4). In this cohort, thirty-eight prior biopsy samples prior to surgery were reviewed; 76% revealed malignancy, but none showed definitive organizing pneumonia likely due to focal nature of OP. Cohort 2 (n=40), 7.5% of patients in whom organizing pneumonia was identified through minimally invasive bronchoscopic sampling were ultimately diagnosed with concurrent lung cancer. All required repeat tissue sampling for cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Lung malignancy is known to be associated with OP. A high degree of suspicion should be maintained if OP is found on minimally invasive techniques, particularly if malignancy is strongly suspected.</description>

The CLEFT-Q is the first condition-specific tool to assess quality of life (QoL) in CL/P patients, yet limited data exist on postoperative outcomes, especially in nonwestern populations. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the QoL of CL/P patients who had undergone secondary surgical correction for deformities following cheiloplasty. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Plastic Surgery Hospital from July 2023 to June 2024, enrolling individuals aged 8-29 years, including CL/P subjects who had undergone secondary surgical correction after cheiloplasty and healthy controls. PREDICTOR VARIABLES: The primary predictor variable was disease status (CL/P vs healthy controls). Within the CL/P group, cleft phenotypes served as the secondary predictor variable. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome variable was QoL, quantified by the CLEFT-Q scale. Higher scores indicate better patient-reported outcomes. COVARIATES: Age, household income, and parental education were identified as significant confounders and included as covariates in the final multivariable models. ANALYSES: Independent samples t-tests, χ2 tests, nonparametric methods, Spearman's correlation analyses, one-way analysis of variance, and multivariable linear regression were employed. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05, with Benjamini-Hochberg and posthoc Bonferroni corrections applied to control for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: A total of 133 participants were enrolled, including 100 (75.2%) CL/P subjects and 33 (24.8%) healthy controls. Bivariate screening identified age, household income, and parental education as statistically significant covariates, whereas sex and surgical characteristics demonstrated no statistically significant confounding effects. In multivariable models adjusting for these covariates, the CL/P group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in appearance scores compared to control group (all P ≤ .005, unstandardized B &lt; 0). Conversely, no statistically significant differences were observed in any health-related QoL subscales (all P &gt; .2). Furthermore, subgroup analyses within the CL/P group revealed that cleft phenotype was not statistically significantly associated with QoL following Benjamini-Hochberg correction. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CL/P was independently associated with lower self-perceived appearance scores. Higher household income and parental education levels served as protective factors, whereas increasing age was inversely associated with QoL.</description>

There is limited published evidence to date suggesting higher prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with meningiomas. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate this association. METHODS: The medical records from 584 patients with intracranial meningiomas were reviewed. The prevalence of thyroid disease was calculated as well as odds ratios to compare patient cohorts. Subsequently, the results were externally validated using SlicerDicer data from a second institution's electronic medical record. RESULTS: Within the Endeavor Intracranial Meningioma cohort, thyroid disease was found in 196/584 (33.6%): hypothyroidism in 154/584 (26.4%), nodular disease in 34/584 (5.8%), thyroid cancer in 9/584 (1.5%), and hyperthyroidism in 8/584 (1.4%) patients. An additional 9/584 (1.5%) patients had a different thyroid disease or diagnosis. Our external validation with patients only from the second institution yielded significant association of meningioma with thyroid hormone medication use (OR = 6.1), hypothyroidism (OR = 7.5), thyroid cancer (OR = 14.6), hyperthyroidism (OR = 5.9), and thyroid nodules (OR = 10.8). Comparing meningioma patients to patients with glioblastoma yielded a similar association between meningioma and general thyroid disorders (OR = 2.1), thyroid hormone usage (OR = 2.1), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.7), thyroid cancer (OR = 3.1), and thyroid nodules (OR = 7.5). These observations were not confounded by female overrepresentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism, to be a common comorbid condition in patients with intracranial meningiomas in two independent datasets. Further research is needed to assess the role of thyroid disorders in the outcomes for patients with meningioma.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: A case series conducted across nine Brazilian oral and maxillofacial pathology centers. Cases were morphologically evaluated using hematoxylin and eosin staining and a panel of immunohistochemical markers. Data were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Of the 97 cases initially screened, 15 fulfilled the diagnostic criteria. Most patients were female (73.3%), aged between 32 and 88 years. The palate was the most frequently affected site (40%). Lesions had a mean size of 15.7 mm and a mean duration of 12.9 months, typically presenting as painless nodules (73.3%) with a smooth surface (53.3%). Histopathological examination revealed dense lymphoid infiltrates with follicular architecture and well-developed germinal centers. Immunohistochemically, CD20 was positive in germinal centers, CD3 in interfollicular zones, Bcl-2 was negative in germinal centers, and Ki-67 exhibited focal positivity. CONCLUSION: extranodal ILH/FLH of the oral cavity is a benign, indolent lymphoproliferative disorder that predominantly affects women beyond the third decade of life. CD20 and Bcl-2 are key markers for accurate differential diagnosis and microscopic confirmation.</description>

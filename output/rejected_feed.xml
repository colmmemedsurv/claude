The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is dysregulated and associated with poor prognosis in NHL. The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has preclinical activity in hematologic malignancy models. METHODS: NCT05008055 was a modular, open-label, multicenter phase II study that examined oral capivasertib monotherapy in patients with R/R B-cell NHL who had received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. Patients had R/R FL (Cohort 1A), MZL (Cohort 1B), or MCL (Cohort 1C). Capivasertib 480 mg twice daily was administered orally 4 days on/3 days off. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: 30 patients were enrolled (of 272 planned). The ORRs for patients with R/R FL, MZL, and MCL were 18.8% (3/16), 33.3% (1/3), and 30% (3/10), respectively; 62.5% (10/16) of patients with R/R FL had stable disease. Baseline tumor PTEN expression was deficient/undetectable in the two patients who had a complete response and three of five patients who had a partial response. The most common capivasertib-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (63.3%), nausea (20%), vomiting (13.3%), and hyperglycemia (10%). Capivasertib-related grade ≥3 AEs or serious AEs were observed in 9 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study was terminated early with a small sample size, limiting interpretation, although antitumor activity was limited. Future studies of capivasertib in hematologic malignancies would likely require biomarker-directed patient selection and/or combination therapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tawk K, Dichter A, Park T, Abouzari M, Oliaei S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70333'&gt;10.1002/lary.70333&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424261/'&gt;41424261&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential risk factors associated with the development of sialolithiasis in a database-driven case-control study. METHODS: The All of Us database was queried for participants with sialolithiasis. These participants were matched to controls by age, race, and gender. Demographics and medical history data, such as obesity, hypertension, tonsillitis, gout, and other conditions associated with salivary stones, were extracted and compared among participants. A logistic regression model using optimized parameters was used to identify variables associated with sialolithiasis. RESULTS: In total, 2160 participants were included in the analysis, with 540 diagnosed with sialolithiasis and 1620 matched controls. Sjogren's syndrome (OR = 2.057, 95% CI: 1.106-3.824, p = 0.023) and obesity (OR = 1.419, 95% CI: 1.118-1.802, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with increased odds of sialolithiasis, while essential hypertension (OR = 0.279, 95% CI: 0.23-0.339, p = 0.0) and Type 2 diabetes without complication (OR = 0.771, 95% CI: 0.601-0.989, p = 0.041) were inversely associated. No significant associations were observed for dehydration, hyperparathyroidism, acute tonsillitis, alcohol abuse, smoking, hypercalcemia, gout, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis, or bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using a large-scale database, aimed to identify potential risk factors associated with sialolithiasis, thereby improving our understanding of its pathogenesis and paving the way for early diagnosis and intervention. The commonality among the identified risk factors appears to be their association with reduced salivary flow or alterations in fluid dynamics and composition, which are known contributors to the formation of salivary stones.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Anekal S, Tadikonda A, Sobczak G, Chen LW, Bhatt A, Wesson T, Finnegan PR, Halum S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70313'&gt;10.1002/lary.70313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424184/'&gt;41424184&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) due to recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is a common cause of dysphonia. No biotherapeutic injectable exists that directs laryngeal reinnervation after RLN injury. Placental-derived connective tissue matrix (pd-CTM) could fill this need, as it contains a plethora of cytokines with potential UVFP therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to identify and quantify the factors in a commercially available pd-CTM (CTM Flow, CTM Biomedical, Lake Worth, Florida) and to study the effects of pd-CTM on vocal fold microenvironment and glottic function in a mouse model of unilateral RLN injury. METHODS: Cytokine expression (ng/mL) in pd-CTM was characterized using a cytokine array and ELISA. In a separate experiment, C57/BL6 mice were divided into three groups: uninjured negative controls (n = 12), RLN transection with ipsilateral saline thyroarytenoid (TA) injection (n = 16), and RLN transection with ipsilateral pd-CTM TA injection. Outcomes included laryngeal electromyography (L-EMG) and video laryngoscopy after 7 and 28 days, with larynges then harvested and analyzed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qPCR. RESULTS: pd-CTM characterization showed moderate-to-high levels of neurotrophic (BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, NTF-3), angiogenic (Angiogenin, VEGF-D), tissue remodeling (bFGF, IGF-1, HGF, TGF-β3), and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1Rα). L-EMG demonstrated increased mean normalized area under the curve ratio in pd-CTM treated mice compared to saline treated mice at the 28-day time point indicating reinnervation (p &lt; 0.001). IHC detected innervated neuromuscular junctions 28 days after pd-CTM treatment. CONCLUSION: pd-CTM may be a novel treatment option for patients with UVFP based on the neurotrophic, angiogenic, tissue remodeling, and anti-inflammatory factors present. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.</description>

This study evaluated whether automated creak distinguished speakers with adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD), primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD), and those without voice disorders during conversational speech. METHODS: Two stimulus types (reading passage and conversational speech) were produced by 50 speakers with AdLD, 50 speakers with pMTD, and 50 control speakers. An automated creak detector was used to calculate the percentage (%) of creak in both stimuli. The effects of group, stimulus type, and their interaction on % creak were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the creak detector in distinguishing among groups. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant effect of group on % creak, but no effect of stimulus type on % creak, suggesting that creak distinguished speakers with AdLD, pMTD, and controls during both a reading passage and conversational speech. AUC values indicated acceptable discriminative ability in distinguishing AdLD speakers from both pMTD speakers and controls across both stimuli types. CONCLUSION: Automated creak demonstrates promise as a discriminative feature for identifying differences between speakers with AdLD from pMTD and controls in both a reading passage and conversational speech.</description>

The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response assessed by two independent pathologists and was defined as no residual viable tumours at both the primary tumour site and all the lymph nodes. The secondary endpoints included adverse events and overall survival time. In total, 85.4% of patients experienced adverse events of any grade, and 4.2% reported Grade 3 adverse events; 45 patients underwent pathological evaluation, 14 (31.1%, 95% confidence interval, 18.2-46.6%) achieved pathological complete response, and the two-year survival rate was 88.3%. Imaging mass cytometry revealed that patients without pathological complete response presented immunosuppressive molecule expression, and expanded immunosuppressive fibroblast neighbourhoods. Here we show, serplulimab and chemotherapy are associated with modest antitumour activity and a tolerable safety profile in patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A phase 3 randomised trial featuring continued follow-up is essential for a formal evaluation. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05659251.</description>

Recent studies in multiple breast cancer mouse models have found that antibiotics, by altering the gut microbiota, can accelerate tumour growth. In humans, a recent cohort study restricted to triple negative breast cancer showed that breast cancer patients using a greater number of antibiotics had markedly worse survival. These studies have raised concerns about repeated antibiotic use in breast cancer patients. In this Registered Report, we investigated whether breast cancer patients using oral antibiotics had increased breast cancer-specific mortality. In population-based cohorts (n = 44,452), we did not observe a statistically significant association between antibiotic prescriptions after diagnosis and breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 1.07 95% CI 0.87, 1.33) apart from prescriptions of 12 or more antibiotics (adjusted HR = 1.62 95% CI 1.31, 2.01). This association was weaker after adjustment for infections (adjusted HR = 1.44 95% 1.14, 1.81), when restricted to antibiotics within five years (adjusted HR = 1.33 95% 0.95, 1.84), and was similar for deaths from other causes (adjusted HR = 1.69 95% 1.19, 2.41). Frequent antibiotic users had higher cancer-specific mortality but the attenuation of associations in sensitivity analyses, and similar findings for other causes of death, suggest this increase may reflect residual confounding.

METHODS: ProsD is a phase-II double-blinded randomized trial of newly diagnosed, low-intermediate risk PC cases, aged between 50 and 80 years and on AS. The intervention was a monthly oral dose of cholecalciferol (50,000IU; Vitamin D) or placebo. Primary and secondary endpoints were active therapy-free (ATFS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, respectively. Blood samples were analysed for vitamin D metabolites and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN) markers for lymphocytic genome damage. RESULTS: There were 123 randomised participants (81 vitamin D and 42 placebo) included in this analysis. Mean (SD) for age was 66.5 (6.6) years and for 25(OH)D levels were 72.0 (19.9) and 66.4 (18.4) nmol/L at baseline (p = 0.1), and 91.9 (19.9) and 60.4 (24.4) nmol/L at 24 months, in the vitamin D and placebo arms respectively. There were no appreciable differences in ATFS (plog-rank = 0.44), PFS (p plog-rank = 0.60) and occurrence of adverse events, in each trial arm. There were declines in some of the lymphocytic CBMN markers in the vitamin D arm. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did not prevent PC progression, although reduced prevalence of CBMN markers may indicate a benefit of vitamin D supplementation.

To address this unmet clinical need, we perform proteomic and bioinformatic analyses and identify lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as a critical driver of LNM in ESCC. LAMP1 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumors that with LNM and correlates with worse survival outcomes across independent cohorts. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that LAMP1 promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LAMP1 interacts with DNA-PKcs, mediates AKT activation, leading to VEGFC upregulation and secretion, thereby driving lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Importantly, treatment with the LAMP1 inhibitor Parishin C significantly suppresses LNM in preclinical ESCC models. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized LAMP1/DNA-PKcs/AKT/VEGFC signaling axis that promotes ESCC progression and highlight LAMP1 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for preventing LNM and improving patient outcomes.</description>

We aim to construct a short-term prediction model for the daily incidence of common intestinal infectious diseases in Changzhou city. METHODS: The daily incidence data of hand, foot, and mouth disease and other infectious diarrhea in Changzhou and the daily meteorological data and air pollutant data in the same period were collected from May 13, 2014 to December 31, 2024. The meteorological data consisted of temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, etc. Air pollutant data included PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and AQI indicators. Three models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer, and a hybrid model combining seasonal trend decomposition with Transformer, were constructed and compared. Additionally, an advanced STL-T-L hybrid model (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess, Transformer, and LSTM) was proposed for further analysis. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the hyperparameters of the deep learning model. The model integrated historical incidence data, environmental factors, and engineered time characteristics, lag terms, and rolling statistics. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute scale error (MASE) were calculated on the independent test set to evaluate the prediction performance of the model. RESULTS: Among all the evaluated models, the STL-T-L hybrid model showed the best prediction performance on the test set, with RMSE of 6.337, MAE of 4.524, MAPE of 58.482%, MASE of 0.638. The prediction model built in this study considered the historical incidence of the disease and incorporated various meteorological and air pollution factors. The results showed that the STL-T-L model incorporating these features achieved the best prediction results. CONCLUSION: The STL-T-L model can effectively predict the common intestinal infectious diseases and can be used as a tool for monitoring and early warning of intestinal infectious diseases in Changzhou.</description>

APX3330 selectively inhibits Ref-1's redox function without affecting its DNA repair role. This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study in advanced solid tumors was aimed at determining the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) while assessing safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker evidence of target engagement. METHODS: Nineteen cancer patients were treated, with eight completing follow-up. Subjects received APX3330 orally twice daily in 21-day cycles, starting at 240 mg/day and escalating in 120 mg/day increments. Adverse event (AE) monitoring followed a 1 pt/cohort approach until a &gt;G2 toxicity event, after which a 3 + 3 design was implemented. Treatment continued until disease progression, consent withdrawal, or intolerable toxicity. Antitumor activity was assessed using RECIST 1.1, and pharmacodynamic markers included serum Ref-1 levels and circulating tumor cells. RESULTS: Six of nineteen subjects had stable disease, and no treatment-related SAEs were observed. One subject (720 mg cohort) withdrew due to Grade 3 maculopapular rash (dose-limiting toxicity). Laboratory assessments and ECGs showed no clinically significant abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: APX3330 showed preliminary signals of disease control and on-target pharmacology in this first-in-human study. Based on safety and PD, the RP2D is 600 mg/day. Given the small sample size, efficacy conclusions are exploratory (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03375086).</description>

Although many studies have examined HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptance, and uptake in university students, findings remain heterogeneous, and comprehensive quantitative synthesis is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess global estimates of university students' knowledge of HPV and its vaccine, willingness to receive the vaccine, and actual vaccination behaviors. METHODS: The study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Checklist. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang Database for studies published from January 2006 through August 2024. Studies with quality assessment scores &gt; 5 and published in Chinese or English were included for data extraction. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. The heterogeneity statistic I-squared and corresponding p value were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies covering 184,351 university students from four continents (Asia, Africa, Europe and North America) were included. Among students, 68.3% (95% CI 56.4%-79.0%) and 53.5% (95% CI 53.0%-54.1%) were aware of HPV and HPV vaccine, respectively, with significant gaps in knowledge about HPV symptoms, cervical cancer screening methods, and optimal vaccination timing. Pooled HPV vaccination willingness was 52.9% (95% CI 44.2%-61.6%), with higher willingness observed among females and medical students. Only 10.4% (95% CI 6.1%-15.8%) had received at least 1 dose of vaccination and 12.4% (95% CI 3.0%-26.9%) had completed the full three-dose schedule. Vaccination coverage among females was 8.6% (95% CI 3.7%-15.1%), and among medical students, 7.7% (95% CI 1.3%-18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that university students exhibit limited awareness of HPV and its vaccine, with about half willing to be vaccinated. Actual vaccination rates remain low and vary widely by gender, major, time of year, and geographic regions. These findings highlight the need for targeted intervention strategies, such as precision education and cross-sector collaboration, to effectively increase HPV vaccination coverage in this population.</description>

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of LVI and develop a modified post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypStage) system integrating LVI and ypTNM stage to improve risk stratification. METHODS: This multi-institutional study included patients with ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and R0 resection. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to derive prognostic groupings. A modified ypStage system was developed, validated, and compared with ypTNM stage. RESULTS: A total of 931 patients were divided into training (n = 565) and external validation (n = 366) cohorts. LVI was present in 115 patients (12.4%). LVI was an independent predictor of survival and disease recurrence, with hazard ratios of 1.70 for overall survival and 1.74 for recurrence-free survival. By integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage, nonmetastatic ESCC were classified into three stages with distinct prognoses. The proposed RPA stage provided superior hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, sample size balance, and outcome prediction over ypTNM stage. CONCLUSIONS: LVI was a strong prognostic factor, independent of the current ypTNM stage in ESCC. We developed an RPA-based ypStage system integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage that exhibited good prognostic performance.</description>

Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer.</description>

A significant proportion of penicillin allergy labels are incorrect; here we review the published evidence on the costs, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of penicillin allergy testing. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published economic evaluations of penicillin allergy testing in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, EconPapers (RePeC) and the International HTA Database (INAHTA) and included reports of full or partial economic evaluations of costs and/or health benefits of penicillin allergy testing strategies. The outcomes of interest were healthcare resource use, medical costs, and health-related quality of life for patients with a penicillin allergy label and for patients with the label removed, and cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the methodological quality of the studies using a published checklist designed for systematic reviews. The review followed a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed the effect of testing on the costs of antibiotic use among patients admitted to hospital with a PAL. Studies measured costs of testing (n = 19); antibiotic medication use (n = 23); adverse reactions with penicillin use (n = 4), alternative antibiotic drugs (n = 3); length of hospital stay (n = 5); subsequent health care use episodes (n = 4); and antibiotic medication use in subsequent care episodes (n = 3). The median cost of skin testing plus oral challenge across six primary costing studies was USD 246 (range: 164, 514), which contrasts with the USD 42-258 range of antibiotic cost savings during the initial hospital admission. Two studies presented evidence that penicillin allergy testing is cost-saving in an outpatient setting over 3.5-4.5 years. One model-based study reported that testing in inpatient settings is cost-saving. No reports on the effect of penicillin allergy testing on health-related quality of life were found and the two cost-effectiveness studies that accounted for this outcome employed the opinion of healthcare professional or an assumption of a common generic value for adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: While penicillin allergy testing shows promise in reducing antibiotic costs, the evidence remains insufficient to definitively establish whether these savings consistently outweigh testing costs across various healthcare settings.</description>

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play a crucial role in the immune response and significantly influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic and immunological implications of TLS-associated molecular subtypes in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, we applied 10 multi-omics integration strategies to perform a multi-omics analysis of the mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, and genomic mutation data of 39 TLSs-related genes, along with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles, to generate integrated consensus subtypes of LUSC. Four molecular subtypes were identified: cancer subtype 1 (CS1), CS2, CS3, and CS4. We observed a significant difference in overall survival between cancer subtype 1 (CS1) and CS3. Subsequently, we identified 33 prognosis-related genes based on differential expression between CS1 and CS3, which were further refined to 20 genes using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and constructed a prognostic signature termed the LUSC-Survival Prediction Index (LUSCSPI). The high-LUSCSPI group demonstrated a poor prognosis and was more likely to benefit from treatment with nine chemotherapeutic agents (shikonin, doxorubicin, CMK, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, paclitaxel, DMOG, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and crizotinib). In contrast, the low-LUSCSPI group exhibited a more favorable prognosis, with thapsigargin and cisplatin identified as promising treatment options. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of LUSCSPI as an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. Further, the multi-omics consensus approach provides a robust foundation for prognostic stratification in LUSC patients, facilitating personalized treatment and disease management.</description>

Host behavior is an important component of this axis, and variation in individual animal personalities can shape the dynamics, composition, and evolutionary trajectory of an ecosystem. Relative boldness or shyness is a commonly used personality metric across vertebrate animals, and the composition of an organism's microbiome may be important in shaping this trait. Turtles have been poorly characterized in terms of behavior and microbiome, though they are the most threatened vertebrate group on Earth and therefore warrant more study. To address this gap, we compared the gut microbiota of bold and shy Eastern Box Turtles to investigate any correlation between microbial composition and personality type. Free-ranging Eastern Box Turtles were captured and assayed for their personality, and cloacal, skin, and oral swab samples were collected. Microbial DNA from swabs was amplified and sequenced. Female turtles had significantly higher alpha microbial diversities than male turtles and shy turtles had a significantly higher microbial diversity than bold turtles. Four significantly overabundant bacteria were found (two in bold turtles and two in shy turtles). The steroid biosynthesis pathway was significantly overrepresented in bold turtles, while the bile acid biosynthesis pathway and purine degradation to urea modules were significantly overrepresented in shy turtles. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria are implicated in the classification of Eastern Box Turtle personality. While our conclusions should be considered in the context of limited sample sizes, our data suggest prominent metabolic pathways, modules, and bacteria that are implicated in different Eastern Box Turtle personality types, suggesting a possible microbial influence on the personality of this well-known but threatened species.</description>

While various clinical features suggest ODS, diagnosing some ODS patients can be challenging. This study aimed to determine the value of maxillary sinus papillary edema (MSPE) in predicting ODS. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent at least maxillary antrostomy for unilateral sinus disease (USD). Adequately powered samples of three USD cohorts were generated: ODS, infectious maxillary CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and noninfectious CRSwNP. Multiple variables were collected, but the primary outcome was MSPE presence via double-blinded endoscopic image review by three rhinologists. Inter-rater agreement was calculated, and a predictive model for MSPE was generated. RESULTS: Of 41 ODS, 22 infectious CRSsNP, and 13 noninfectious CRSwNP patients, mean age was 57.0 years and 55.3% were female. There was almost perfect agreement between rhinologists when assessing for MSPE on endoscopic images (κ = 0.927). MSPE was seen in 100% of ODS, 22.7% infectious CRSsNP, and 0% CRSwNP. MSPE was significantly more likely in ODS compared to non-odontogenic CRS (p &lt; 0.0001), demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 89.1% specificity for ODS, with 85.7% positive and 100% negative predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: MSPE is a distinct finding that is reliably identifiable and is significantly more likely in ODS compared to infectious CRSsNP and noninfectious CRSwNP. With 100% sensitivity and NPV, MSPE absence makes ODS very unlikely. With 86% PPV, MSPE is not pathognomonic for ODS, but should arouse suspicion for a possible odontogenic source.</description>

Use of effective contraception has been proven to reduce the likelihood of a subsequent unplanned pregnancy, but there are limited data on contraceptive choices, and other socio-demographic factors among women across various districts in Malaysia who have had an unplanned pregnancy. AIM: We investigated factors associated with a history of unplanned pregnancy, and intention to become pregnant in the near future, among reproductively aged women in Malaysia. STUDY SETTING AND METHODOLOGY: Retrospective study based on data collected from the Mothers and Infants in SEACO (South East Asian Community Observatory) Segamat Project (MISS-P) between 2013 and 2021. Women who were known to have given birth were approached by trained data collectors within 0-16 weeks after childbirth. Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to assess socio-demographic factors associated with unplanned pregnancy and pregnancy spacing with a p value significance level of &lt;0.05. A total of 4278 Malaysian postpartum mothers completed a survey, with a range of measures, including sociodemographic questions and contraceptive behaviours. RESULTS: Approximately 29% of women aged 15 to 47 had a history of unplanned pregnancy and 41% reported not currently using any type of contraception. Around 94% of women reported not having ready access to contraception. The most commonly used method of contraception was the oral contraceptive pill. Being older than 25 years was associated with a reduced likelihood of a history of unplanned pregnancy, while not currently using contraception was associated with a greater likelihood of having had a previous unplanned pregnancy. Women using long acting reversible contraception and the contraceptive injection were less likely to be planning a pregnancy in the near future (&lt; 3 years). CONCLUSIONS: There is low contraceptive use in this sample, particularly among women who have had a history of unplanned pregnancy, with lack of access to contraception cited as the main driver. Mothers, as well as young women, in Malaysia may benefit from health promotion activities to further inform contraceptive counselling interventions to reduce the risk of subsequent unplanned pregnancies and improve pregnancy planning.</description>

We evaluated knowledge and awareness of HPV infection and risk factors for anal cancer among PLWH in Puerto Rico (PR). METHODS: Data from a cross-sectional study (2020-2021) were analyzed (n = 212). Inclusion criteria included PLWH, aged ≥ 26 years, and living in PR. Telephone interviews collected information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. Two 13-item scales were used to assess knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors; adequate knowledge for both scales were defined as scoring &gt; 70%. Logistic regression models using generalized linear models were used to determine the association between (1) HPV infection awareness, (2) HPV infection knowledge, and (3) anal cancer risk factors knowledge. RESULTS: The median age was 54 years (IQR: 46,58), 67.5% were male, 71.7% reported having an income &lt;$20,000, and 54.2% had an education level of more than high school. HPV awareness was high (82.1%), but only 40.2% and 3.8% had adequate knowledge of HPV and anal cancer risk factors, respectively. In adjusted logistic regression models, men who have sex with men (OR: 1.26, 95%CI: 1.07-1.47) and women (OR: 1.35, 95%CI: 1.15-1.59) aged ≥ 50 years had higher odds of HPV awareness than heterosexual men in that age group. Moreover, those with history of anal Pap test aged &lt; 50 years had more HPV awareness (OR 1.34, 95%CI: 1.08-1.66) than their counterparts. Adequate HPV knowledge was higher among participants with an education level of more than high-school (OR:1.28, 95%CI: 1.10-1.50) and with a history of HPV diagnosis (OR:1.33, 95%CI: 1.08-1.65) than their counterparts. In addition, people with good/very good/excellent health perception had higher odds of HPV knowledge (OR:1.23, 95%CI: 1.03-1.47) than those who reported poor/regular health perception. For anal cancer risk factors, those living with HIV for ≥ 15 years had increased odds of having adequate knowledge (OR:1.07, 95%CI: 1.02-1.14) than their counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Despite high awareness of HPV, limited knowledge about HPV and anal cancer risk factors was observed among PLWH. Results from our study highlight the need for educational efforts within this population as an anal cancer prevention strategy.</description>

This study shows that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)'s inherent bioactivities, including proliferation, metabolism, and colorectal colonization, can be enhanced by manganese, prompting the fabrication of a manganese-engineered strain (MnLR). Oral administration of MnLR with its metabolic substrate-glycerol (MnLR/Gly) promotes the enrichment of L. reuteri and its antitumor metabolites within colon tumors. Across multiple preclinical colon tumor models, MnLR/Gly alone achieves a 95.6% inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth, liver metastases reduction by 62.1%, and confers durable protection, with 75% of prophylactically treated mice remaining long-term tumor-free and 62.5% resisting tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, MnLR/Gly induces both intratumoral and peripheral dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and effector T-cell responses. In orthotopic CRC rabbit models, GlyMnLR enteric capsules demonstrate significant antitumor efficacy comparable to standard chemotherapy while exhibiting favorable safety. These findings highlight MnLR as an effective standalone probiotic therapy for CRC prevention and treatment.</description>

Notably, some URPs have exhibited non-classical biological functions. In this study, we experimentally elucidate the role of the E3 ubiquitin ligase IRF2BPL as transcriptional activator that promotes malignant phenotypes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and inhibits the infiltration of various immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, we found that IRF2BPL is highly expressed in ESCC cells and promotes IGFBP2 transcription, thereby facilitating ESCC development both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, the chemical drug ONC201 was shown to effectively impede ESCC progression induced by the hyperactive IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis in tumor cells. Collectively, our findings verified that the IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis plays a critical role in enhancing ESCC progression by increasing the malignancy of ESCC cells and fostering an immune-deficient tumor microenvironment. Targeting the IRF2BPL-IGFBP2 axis may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for ESCC.</description>

KRM1 is its only known receptor, but its precise role remains unclear. This study investigates CVA6's entry mechanism and antibody neutralization. Cryo-EM shows CVA6 clinical strain HeB primarily exists as mature virions. KRM1 binding within the canyon triggers conversion to uncoating intermediate, defining KRM1 as an uncoating receptor for CVA6. However, KRM1 knockout reduces CVA6 infectivity without affecting attachment. Conversely, disrupting heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) impairs both viral attachment and infectivity, and CVA6 virions bind heparin directly. These results support a two-receptor entry model for CVA6: HSPG mediates viral attachment, while KRM1 induces uncoating. Additionally, we develop two CVA6-specific protective antibodies (1F4 and 3H7), targeting a new antigenic site near the three-fold axis of the viral capsid. These antibodies sterically block KRM1 binding and function post-attachment, consistent with KRM1's role. The findings elucidate CVA6 entry and offer a basis for antibody interventions.</description>

In honeybees (Apis mellifera), a critical defensive behavior is the sting extension reflex. However, it remains unclear how the gut microbiota affects aversive learning and memory of this behavior. Here we demonstrate that the normal gut microbiota contributes to aversive learning and memory of the sting extension reflex in honeybees. Metabolomics analysis reveals that the gut microbiota affects tyrosine metabolism of the gut and hemolymph. Oral reintroduction of Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis restores aversive learning and memory of microbiota-free honeybees, with an increase in their brain dopamine levels by supplying exogenous tyrosine. Conversely, applying fluphenazine, which decreases brain dopamine levels, weakens aversive learning and memory of honeybees in normal hives. These findings provide insights into the role of gut bacteria in regulating aversive learning and memory in honeybees, highlighting beneficial effects of the gut microbiota on the cognitive behaviors of social insects.</description>

METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included 20,486 patients between 2014 and 2023 in Shanxi China. Detection rates for cervical, vaginal, and vulvar lesions were retrospectively analyzed across strata by HPV status, cytological diagnosis, and clinical manifestations (vaginal bleeding/discharge). Multinomial logistic regression was applied to calculate odds ratios for high-grade lesions and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). RESULTS: High-risk HPV (hr-HPV) infection was detected in 16,636 of 20,486 women (81.2%), and 9,137 (44.6%) had ASC-US+ cytology. Following cervical lesion detection on histopathology among hr-HPV-positive women (CIN2/3: 19.9%; SCC: 5.3%; AIS/ADC: 0.4%), additional lesions were identified at other anatomical sites: vaginal lesions (VaIN2/3: 3.6%; SCC: 1.1%; AIS/ADC: 0.04%) and vulvar lesions (VIN2/3: 0.4%; SCC: 0.1%) were further identified. Overall, 21.6% of hr-HPV-positive women exhibited high-grade lesions (CIN/VaIN/VIN2/3), with 5.6% demonstrating multi-focal SCC and 0.4% showing AIS/ADC. Stratified analysis revealed that patients even with negative HPV or cytology result still had relative high detection rate of high-grade lesions. Among these HPV-negative women, those reporting vaginal bleeding/discharge carried an elevated risk, with 3.2% having high-grade lesions and 10.5% having SCC. The integrative examination combining hr-HPV, cytology, and vaginal bleeding/discharge identified 3,753 high-grade lesions and 1,154 cancers. CONCLUSION: Integrating the assessment of hr-HPV testing, cytology, and clinical symptoms (e.g., vaginal bleeding or discharge) could help finding more cases of multisite lesions (cervical, vaginal, vulvar). This is especially important for some high-risk women, including those who visit the colposcopy clinics, and more attention should be paid to the multisite examination.</description>

However, no previous studies have examined injury patterns within the population of professional and student singers only. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of clinical presentations for laryngologic care among professional and student singers according to age, sex, and diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective case review collected primary diagnosis, age, sex, and self-reported professional or student status for singers who presented with voice complaints from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2024. Iatrogenic injuries, malignancy, and neurodegenerative disease processes were excluded. RESULTS: Records of 1139 singers were included (n = 1139, 416 male, 723 female, median age 30, age range 17-79). Presentations were predominantly professional female singers (63% F, 85% professional) between ages 20 and 35. Peaks in presentations were seen at ages 22, 26, and 30, in support of prior literature and clinical observations. A peak in both sexes was also seen at age 52, potentially coinciding with menopause and effects of senescence. There were strongly significant associations between age group and diagnosis and sex and diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), especially bilateral midfold masses and female sex (p &lt; 0.001) across all age groups (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data inform counseling for professional singers and support screening exams at early career milestones to reduce healthcare burden and costs over the lifetime for this high-risk population.</description>

Standard-dose rifampin has limited central nervous system penetration. Whether high-dose rifampin could improve survival outcomes is unknown. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving adults with tuberculous meningitis in Indonesia, South Africa, and Uganda. We assigned persons with and those without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection to receive standard daily isoniazid, rifampin (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide plus either additional rifampin (for a cumulative dose of 35 mg per kilogram; high-dose group) or matched placebo (standard-dose group) for 8 weeks; participants in both groups received standard therapy for the remainder of the 9-to-12-month treatment course. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. RESULTS: A total of 499 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population (249 randomly assigned to the high-dose group and 250 to the standard-dose group), of whom 304 (60.9%) were persons living with HIV and 428 (85.8%) had definite or probable tuberculous meningitis. During 6 months of follow-up, 109 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 44.6%) in the high-dose group and 100 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 40.7%) in the standard-dose group died (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.54; P = 0.25). Among the participants who died within 6 months, the median time to death was 13 days (interquartile range, 4 to 39) in the high-dose group and 24 days (interquartile range, 6 to 56) in the standard-dose group. Drug-induced liver injury occurred in 8.0% of the participants in the high-dose group and in 4.4% of those in the standard-dose group, but no deaths from drug-induced liver injury occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with tuberculous meningitis, no evidence of beneficial effect from high-dose rifampin was observed, and the potential for a harmful effect cannot be ruled out.

It has been suggested that approximately half are human papillomavirus (HPV) associated, but large-scale studies on HPV prevalence and time trends are limited. We aimed to examine the high-risk HPV (hrHPV) prevalence in a large single-country study of penile squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) during a 26-year period. From the nationwide Danish Pathology Register, we identified all penile SCCs diagnosed during the period 1995-2020 at hospitals covering most regions in Denmark. Histologic slides were evaluated by expert pathologists, and archived tumor tissue was tested for the presence of HPV DNA using the INNO-LiPA assay. We assessed the overall and type-specific HPV prevalence according to calendar period, age, and histology, and estimated the annual percentage change (EAPC) of hrHPV positivity over the entire study period. We included 1040 penile SCCs. The overall HPV prevalence was 54.5% and the hrHPV prevalence was 50.4%. We observed no change in the prevalence of hrHPV over time (EAPC = -0.03% [95% confidence interval: -0.91; 0.85]). HPV16 was the most prevalent genotype (41.1%), and 50.0% of the penile SCCs had an HPV type that would be covered by the nine-valent HPV vaccine (HPV6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58). Penile SCCs with HPV-associated histological features had the highest hrHPV prevalence, particularly tumors exhibiting basaloid features (81.8%-87.7%). In this large population-based study, covering most regions in Denmark, we found no substantial change in hrHPV prevalence during 1995-2020. Our findings suggest that prophylactic vaccination with the nine-valent HPV vaccine could prevent a considerable part of penile SCCs in Denmark.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ibrahim A, Mahmoud D, Mavandadipur H, Walladbegi J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-14670-3'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-14670-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41408611/'&gt;41408611&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of oral mucositis (OM) is essential for effective management and plays a critical role in ensuring reliable outcomes in clinical trials evaluating OM-prevention and treatment strategies. Currently, no evidence-based guidelines specify which clinical profession should be primarily responsible for OM assessments in patients undergoing high-dose chemotherapy. In most Scandinavian countries, nurses perform daily OM assessments, while dentists specialized in orofacial medicine (considered the gold standard) conduct supplementary evaluations several times per week. However, the concordance between nurses' assessments and those conducted by dentists specialized in orofacial medicine remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the interrater reliability in of OM assessments between these two professions. METHODS: This study utilized data from a randomized, blinded, multicenter, parallel-group, phase 3 trial conducted at five university hospitals in Sweden and Norway. A total of 127 patients aged 18 years or older, diagnosed with multiple myeloma or lymphoma, and scheduled to receive high-dose conditioning chemotherapy in preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, were included. The primary objective was to evaluate the interrater reliability of OM assessments across all severity grades using the World Health Organization (WHO) oral toxicity scale (grades 0-4). The secondary objective was to evaluate the interrater reliability of OM assessments across all severity grades at each individual study site. RESULTS: Overall interrater reliability between nurses and dentists specialized in orofacial was found to be fair for OM of any grade (κ = 0.211, p &lt; 0.001). However, agreement levels at individual study sites ranged from no agreement to fair agreement. CONCLUSION: The interrater reliability in the assessment of oral mucositis between dentists specialized in orofacial medicine and nurses ranged from no-, to fair agreement. This highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve nurses' assessment skills or to integrate a specialized dentist as a permanent member of the multidisciplinary team in oncology and hematology settings. Trial registration This study is based on data from a previously registered clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov; Identifier: NCT03203733, Registered on November 20, 2020).</description>

China has one of the largest populations of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and provides a national free ART program with limited regimens, which currently does not include LAARV. The acceptability of LAARV among PLHIV in China remains unknown. METHODS: Between 1 June 2022 and 30 November 2022, we conducted an online survey among PLHIV in China to assess their acceptance and preference for LAARV. Acceptance was measured on a five-point scale and dichotomized into "more likely to use" (including "definitely" and "probably") and "less likely to use" (including "uncertainly", "would not" and "definitely would not"). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with acceptance. RESULTS: Among the 2570 PLHIV who responded to the questionnaire, 67% expressed interest in LAARV. Participants currently using a single-tablet regimen (STR) showed the highest interest in LAARV (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-2.10). A subjective assessment of suboptimal ART adherence was also associated with greater interest (AOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.13-4.49). Preferences for LAARV modalities, in descending order, were intramuscular injection (every 1-2 months), subdermal implants (every 6-12 months), and intravenous infusion (every 1-2 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals a high acceptance of LAARV among PLHIV in China and identifies key potential user groups, thereby addressing a critical evidence gap regarding LAARV implementation in the country. A cost-competitive long-acting intramuscular injection ART is the most preferred LAARV option in China.</description>

METHODS: We propose the Sample-Positive (SP) technique, which utilizes adjacent tissue morphology in WSIs to effectively sample positive examples. By integrating pathological prior information that reflects spatial adjacency of similar tissues with self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks like SimCLR, MoCo-v3, and SinCLR, we developed an SSL method for WSI. We validated this approach on a dataset of 65 lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cases, covering four histological categories: necrosis, tumor, stroma, and epithelium. Performance was benchmarked against supervised models and original SSL frameworks using fine-tuning and linear evaluation, with metrics including accuracy (Acc), AUC, and F1 score. RESULTS: Our proposed SP technique outperformed baseline SSL methods in fine-tuning and linear evaluation tasks on the LSCC dataset. SPSimCLR and SPMoCo-v3 achieved the highest F1 scores, with SPSimCLR (0.9132) showing a 0.7% improvement over SimCLR (0.9067) and SPMoCo-v3 (0.9133) a 0.5% improvement over MoCo-v3 (0.9088) in fine-tuning, and SinCLR (0.9074) performs comparably to the original SSL methods. In linear evaluation, SPSimCLR (0.9082) improved F1 scores by 1.0% over SimCLR (0.8978), and SPMoCo-v3 (0.9060) improved by 1.2% over MoCo-v3 (0.8942), and SinCLR(0.9021) is surpass the original SSL methods. Ablation studies revealed that overlapping sampling slightly outperformed non-overlapping sampling, and that models trained on patches with single tissue types performed better than those trained on patches containing multiple tissue types. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, combining the SP technique with contrastive learning shows significant improvements in distinguishing histological categories in LSCC, making it effective for WSIs of non-diffuse cancers.</description>

This study aimed to examine the associations between dietary intake, oral hygiene practices, anthropometric measurements, and dental caries in children. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Bursa, Türkiye, between 1 October 2023 and 20 February 2024 with 210 children aged 5-12 years. Data was collected through a structured questionnaire on sociodemographic factors, oral hygiene, and a food frequency questionnaire related to dental health. Body weight and height were measured, and dental examinations were performed by a trained dentist using DMFT/dmft indices. RESULTS: Mean DMFT and dmft scores were 0.9 ± 1.3 and 3.9 ± 2.8, respectively. Children who brushed their teeth had significantly lower caries scores (p &lt; 0.001); brushing twice daily was associated with lower dmft scores (p &lt; 0.001). Caries scores did not differ significantly by body mass index (p &gt; 0.05). Higher DMFT scores were associated with citrus fruits (β = 0.322, p &lt; 0.001), white bread (β = 0.423, p &lt; 0.001), and fruit juice (β = 0.050, p &lt; 0.05) consumption. Higher dmft scores were linked to chocolate (β = 0.286), biscuits, cookies, and cakes (β = 0.448), chips (β = 0.179), and carbonated soft drinks (β = 0.789) (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the importance of promoting healthy eating and proper oral hygiene to prevent childhood dental caries and suggest that early oral health status may have broader implications for long-term systemic health, warranting further longitudinal investigation.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Single-center, tertiary academic facial nerve clinic. METHODS: Adults with inflammatory, schwannoma, parotid neoplasm, or congenital facial paralysis completed FACE-Q modules, the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire-Short Form (TEIQue-SF), and a social support rating. Facial paralysis severity was graded with Sunnybrook scores. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's post hoc testing along with multivariable linear regression assessed associations between etiology and outcomes, adjusting for severity, duration, prior surgical procedures, emotional intelligence, and social support. RESULTS: Etiology independently shaped patient experience in multiple domains. Compared with inflammatory paralysis, parotid neoplasm was associated with worse lip appearance (β = -12.07, SE = 5.05, P = .036), speech function (β = -16.16, SE = 6.40, P = .010), and speech-related distress (β = -5.51, SE = 2.11, P = .009). Congenital paralysis was linked to lower appearance distress (β = 12.81, SE = 5.30, P = .017) and higher social functioning (β = 17.48, SE = 7.13, P = .028). Schwannoma resection had improved facial appearance (β = 7.96, SE = 3.03, P = .020) and psychological function (β = 6.83, SE = 2.89, P = .037). Across etiologies, higher baseline emotional intelligence improved appearance, psychosocial, and functional perceptions, while stronger social support mitigated speech-related distress and outcomes. CONCLUSION: Patient-reported outcomes and lived experience in facial paralysis differ meaningfully by etiology. Beyond clinical severity, a patient's emotional intelligence, social context, and underlying cause of paralysis shape personal perceptions of appearance, function, and well-being. These findings highlight the importance of etiology-specific counseling, rehabilitation, and psychosocial support to optimize recovery and quality of life.</description>

METHODS: In this multicenter, phase III randomized trial, patients with inoperable, locally advanced stage II-IV ESCC were randomized to receive either CRTCT or RT alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), restricted mean survival time (RMST), and patterns of failure. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 75 months, patients in the CRTCT group had longer OS than those in the RT group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.95; P = 0.02), with better 5-year OS rates (34.1 % vs. 23.6 %,P = 0.02), PFS (31.1 % vs. 20.9 %,P = 0.02), and RMST (33.0 vs. 27.0 months,P = 0.02). CRTCT's effect on OS stabilized over 5 years. Locoregional failure was lower in the CRTCT group (HR, 0.64; 95 % CI, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.02), with similar distant and mixed failure risks. CONCLUSIONS: SIB-RT combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy significantly improved long-term survival and therefore might be considered a standard of care for elderly patients with inoperable ESCC.

METHODS: As described in our previous report, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey targeting 782 institutions, asking about the presence of RRP patients during the survey period in 2018 and 2019. A detailed questionnaire was subsequently sent to the 196 institutions that reported having at least one patient, inquiring about age, sex, history of recent surgery, Derkay's score, surgical procedures, and postoperative recurrence. The present study analyzed data from patients who had been diagnosed prior to the beginning of the survey period. RESULTS: Data on 318 previously diagnosed patients were collected from 90 institutions. At their first follow-up visit during the survey period, 85 patients (26.7%) had a Derkay's anatomical score of 0. The true vocal folds were the most commonly affected laryngeal subsites. Of the 318 patients, 165 underwent surgery after the first follow-up visit, and recurrence occurred in 106 after this surgery. The 6- and 12-month additional surgery-free rates were 58.9% and 31.8%. These rates were significantly higher in patients who had undergone one or no surgery within a year prior to the first follow-up visit during the survey period than in those who had undergone two or more surgeries (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The present study revealed real-world data suggesting that the number of recent surgeries and Derkay's anatomical score may be associated with the clinical course of previously diagnosed RRP.</description>

Socioeconomic conditions may influence oral frailty risk. This study examined the socioeconomic inequalities in oral frailty and its components among older adults in Japan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used 2022 questionnaire data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study of adults aged ≥ 65 years. Dependent variables included oral frailty and its five components. Oral frailty was defined as having ≥ 2 of the following: fewer teeth, dry mouth, and difficulty in chewing, swallowing, or speaking. Independent variables were socioeconomic factors, comprising educational attainment, income, wealth, and pension type. Age and sex were adjusted as confounders. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were estimated after applying multiple imputation to address missing data. RESULTS: A total of 21,924 older adults were included. The prevalence of oral frailty was 33.6%. Significant inequalities were identified across all socioeconomic factors. Wealth showed the greatest inequality, with an adjusted SII of 0.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.20) and RII of 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial socioeconomic inequalities in oral frailty were observed, with wealth being the most influential factor.</description>

LUSC develops through multistep progression from low-grade lesions to high-grade lesions, including carcinoma in situ (CIS), of which about half progress to invasive cancer while the other half regress. Although frequent mutations and copy number alterations have been documented in LUSC and observed in precursor lesions, their prognostic significance in precancers remains largely unexplored. In this study, we leveraged gene expression data from LUSC tumors in The Cancer Genome Atlas to derive transcriptional signatures corresponding to 34 key driver genomic aberrations, including mutations, amplifications, and deletions. These tumor-derived signatures were applied to precancerous datasets to assess their ability to characterize developmental stages and predict progression risk. We found many of these signatures increased progressively across lesion stages, reflecting roles in early tumorigenesis. In particular, several signatures accurately predicted which CIS lesions would progress to invasive cancer. Furthermore, these signature scores were more strongly associated with prognosis in LUSC than the presence of genomic aberrations alone. We also examined relationships between driver-associated signatures and the tumor immune microenvironment. Signature scores were significantly correlated with immune features such as immune cell infiltration and immune checkpoint gene expression, including CD274 (PD-L1). These associations varied across stages, indicating dynamic immune interactions during cancer evolution. Together, our findings demonstrate that tumor-derived driver gene expression signatures provide valuable insight into the biology and progression risk of precancerous lesions, offering potential utility for early detection and intervention in LUSC.</description>

This study aimed to assess the thematic focus and clinical representation of otorhinolaryngology-themed ASMR videos using a novel expert-based scoring system and to examine their relationship with viewer engagement. METHODS: Fifty-six YouTube ASMR videos were analyzed and categorized by subspecialty, procedures, and engagement metrics. A clinical representation score (CRS) was developed to assess the degree of clinical representation, and inter-rater reliability for the total score was evaluated using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Viewer interaction was measured using video view rate (VVR) and daily engagement rate (DER). Pearson correlation and ANOVA were used (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Otologic content predominated (96.4%), with otoscopy (89.3%) and earwax removal (53.6%) most common. Rhinologic (33.9%) and head and neck (41.1%) content were underrepresented. Endoscopic or surgical procedures appeared only once each (1.8%). No video addressed facial plastic surgery. Most videos showed moderate (58.7%) or low (28.3%) clinical representation; only one (2.2%) achieved high CRS. A significant inverse correlation was found between CRS and both VVR (r = -0.38, p &lt; 0.01) and DER (r = -0.56, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: This first cross-sectional content analysis of otorhinolaryngology-themed ASMR videos reveals a dominance of otologic content with limited clinical accuracy or scope. The inverse association between CRS and viewer engagement suggests that the most popular videos may offer the least clinical realism. Although not educational in intent, their widespread reach raises important concerns about shaping public expectations of otolaryngologic care. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of subjects undergoing otolaryngologic surgery was performed using the 2016 to 2021 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP). The incidence of CDI and potential risk factors were assessed. RESULTS: One-hundred eighty-five surgical encounters experienced postoperative CDI out of 149 960, with a CDI incidence of 0.12% (8.8 cases per 10,000 patient-days). The greatest number of postoperative CDI was observed in head and neck reconstructive surgeries. On bivariate analysis, risk factors significantly and practically associated with the occurrence of CDI after otolaryngologic surgery were older age and longer operating times. Multiple logistic regression revealed that the CDI rate did not differ among otolaryngology subspecialties but was influenced by age, functional status, and operating times after controlling for relevant confounders. CONCLUSIONS: CDI after otolaryngologic surgery is a serious, costly complication with an incidence comparable to the national CDI rate. Knowledge of the preoperative risk factors associated with CDI may aid in the prevention of such infection after otolaryngologic procedures, thus decreasing patient morbidity and healthcare cost.</description>

Data from 432 patients (training set) and 109 (test set) across two medical institutions were analyzed. Tumor regions were automatically outlined using the Swin-unet network, and habitat clustering within these regions was performed using the k-means method. Radiomics and deep learning features (ResNet-101) were extracted from both global tumor regions and habitat subregions. Laboratory data were integrated, followed by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) feature reduction and machine learning modeling to predict Ki67 expression status. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy (Acc), area under the curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), calibration curves, confusion matrices, and decision curves. The DeLong test was used to compare the diagnostic performance of the composite model with individual models. The results showed that the combined model (Habitat + Global + Laboratory + Deep Learning) achieved the best predictive performance, with Acc, AUC, Sen, Spe, PPV, and NPV of 0.798, 0.838, 0.780, 0.809, 0.711, and 0.859, respectively, in the test set. Calibration curves and confusion matrices confirmed the model's robustness, while decision curves demonstrated its clinical utility. The DeLong test confirmed the composite model's significantly superior AUC compared to several individual models, though not all combined models showed significant differences. However, despite not showing significant advantages in comparisons with some combined models, the composite model, leveraging its unique strength of comprehensively integrating multi-dimensional features, has demonstrated stronger adaptability and stability in real-world clinical application scenarios, providing more reliable support for accurate prediction. In conclusion, preoperative ultrasound image heterogeneity, through the integration of habitat subregion, global tumor, laboratory, and deep learning features, provides valuable insights for predicting Ki67 expression status in breast cancer, enhancing routine preoperative ultrasonography and offering a potential non-invasive method for preoperative Ki67 prediction.</description>

METHODS: This study benchmarked five object detectors including two You Only Look Once models (YOLOv5, YOLOv), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Real-time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) on WLI dataset using harmonized training (from scratch, 150 epochs, identical hyperparameters) and two label configurations: a 4-label as major categories (SCC, Dysplasia, Bleeding, Inflammation) and an 11-label artifact. Evaluation used macro precision/recall/F1 at IoU 0.50 on a fixed 310-image test set. RESULTS: Incorporating artifact classes improved overall macro metrics, with YOLOv5/YOLOv8 providing the strongest performance in the 11-label scenarios, however, class-wise findings revealed persistent recall limitations for early disease. In the 11-label analysis, Dysplasia detection remained low (YOLOv5: 88/201, 43.8%; YOLOv8: 82/201, 40.8%), and SCC was only moderate (YOLOv5: 25/44, 56.8%; YOLOv8: 24/44, 54.5%). Confusion analyses showed that errors were dominated by non-detections ("background") rather than misclassification with benign or artifact labels, while approximately one in five lesion predictions was a spurious unmatched false positive, implicating both sensitivity and specificity constraints. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that labeling artifacts reduces non-lesion confusion but does not, by itself, recover subtle early lesions. Limitations include single-center, WLI-only data and training from scratch, future work should prioritize endoscopy-specific pretraining, explicit artifact suppression or joint segmentation, and external validation.</description>

We demonstrated before that CD26 inhibition decreases lung tumor growth in experimental models. Here, we analyzed the prognostic significance of CD26 expression and its correlation with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in a large series of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC samples from operated patients were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the expression of CD26 and EMT markers. CD26 was scored semi-quantitatively employing tissue microarrays. Lung cancer cell lines [H460, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)] were tested for EMT markers, and a colony formation assay was used to test the effect of treatment with the CD26 inhibitor vildagliptin. RESULTS: Tumor samples from 904 patients with NSCLC were analyzed. CD26 IHC expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma (p &lt; 0.0001). Patients with adenocarcinoma and CD26 expression had a better overall survival than patients without CD26 expression. The lack of CD26 expression was shown to be an independent risk factor for worse survival. CD26-expressing adenocarcinomas showed a higher expression of Vimentin and Elastin (p = 0.0027 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively), while E-cadherin expression was lower in this group of patients (p = 0.0021). In vitro, treatment with vildagliptin reduced the expression of Vimentin and the capacity for colony formation in H460 and LLC cell lines. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The correlation of CD26 expression in lung adenocarcinomas and better patient survival, the antiproliferative effect on tumor cells by CD26 inhibition, and an altered EMT status give rise to the hypothesis that CD26 inhibitors impact the biology and clinical course of lung adenocarcinomas.</description>

Management of ESCC depends on the resectability of the disease, certain patient characteristics, fitness for surgery, and the anatomic complexity of the disease location. Treatment options include either Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCR) followed by surgery or definitive Chemoradiation (DCR). While randomized trials have provided insights into both strategies, no large-scale retrospective real-world studies have been conducted to compare these approaches in diverse, unselected populations. This study assesses real-world outcomes of NCR versus DCR using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NCDB, focusing on patients with ESCC from 2004 to 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) (1:1) was utilized. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: N = 386 patients with esophageal cancer, with a median age of 64 years (IQR, 57.0-70.0), were identified. Patients were evenly distributed between the DCR and NCR groups, with a total of N = 193 participants. We further selected patients with ESCC, a total of N = 311 patients. NCR demonstrated a significantly extended overall survival (OS) compared to those who received DCR, with a median of 33.15 months vs. 20.5 months (P-value: 0.0069), respectively. Patients receiving DCR had significantly worse OS compared to patients receiving NCR with HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.81, p=0.0206. Patients with tumors in the thoracic esophagus (C15.3) showed significant survival benefit from surgery (p=0.0070), whereas no benefit was seen for cervical tumors (C15.0), likely due to anatomical complexity and limited sample size. CONCLUSION: NCR followed by surgery, when feasible, offers survival benefits for patients with ESCC, especially for locally advanced tumors in the thoracic esophagus.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu X, Wang H, Zhao Q, Wang R, Cao H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.10.002'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.10.002&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Oct-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41407647/'&gt;41407647&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effectiveness of virtual reality interventions in alleviating intraoperative pain and anxiety among adult patients undergoing oral surgical procedures. STUDY DESIGN: From the database's creation until Feb 2, 2025, a thorough search was carried out across 13 electronic databases. Anxiety and pain throughout the procedure were important outcomes. The combined impacts were assessed using a random-effects model, with subgroup analyses looking into possible contributing variables. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 method. RESULTS: A total of 9 articles were eventually included in the study selection. Results of the meta-analysis reveal a statistically significant effect of virtual reality in reducing intraoperative anxiety in adults undergoing oral surgery (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI: (-0.48, -0.03), P &lt; .05). Statistically significant effect in reducing intraoperative pain in adult oral surgery (SMD= -0.67, 95% CI: (-1.08, -0.26), P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms the value of virtual reality in terms of oral surgery by distracting adult patients from intraoperative anxiety and pain. However, more high-quality, multicenter, and large-sample randomized controlled trials are needed to further assess its clinical value in the future.</description>

TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs convened an expert panel of 6 members along with an expert consultant group of 18 members to develop evidence-based guidance on dental imaging. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant systematic reviews and organizational guidelines addressing 9 clinical questions. The recommendations presented were developed by means of a non-Delphi process (ie, reaching consensus through a structured process). RESULTS: Due to limitations in the available evidence, consensus recommendations rather than formal guidelines were developed. A thorough evaluation of the patient history and clinical findings should precede radiographic examinations. Previously obtained images should be reviewed, and all imaging modalities, especially cone-beam computed tomography, should be used judiciously to minimize cumulative radiation exposure to the patient. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should base imaging decisions on the patient's medical and dental histories, clinical examination findings, disease risk assessment, and the presence of specific clinical conditions. When used appropriately, radiographic imaging contributes to dental treatment decisions and results in optimal patient care.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: TriNetX Analytics Network, a federated database of de-identified health records from multiple healthcare institutions. METHODS: Infants who underwent primary CLR before 1 year of age were identified using ICD-10 and CPT codes. Patients were categorized into early cleft lip repair (ECLR, &lt;3 months) and traditional cleft lip repair (TLR, 3-12 months) groups. Propensity score matching was performed. Rates of HTS and revision surgery were compared between groups using chi-squared tests and regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 6786 patients, 4321 underwent ECLR and 2465 underwent TLR. HTS was significantly less common in the ECLR group (3.2%) than in the TLR group (5.2%, P = .002). Increasing age at repair was positively correlated with HTS incidence (r2 = 0.58, P = .048). However, revision surgery was more frequent following ECLR (6.6%) compared to TLR (2.6%, P &lt; .001) with age inversely correlated to revision rate (r2 = 0.52, P = .104). These differences persisted after propensity score matching for demographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Earlier CLR (&lt;3 months) is associated with a lower rate of hypertrophic scarring but a higher rate of revision surgery. These findings underscore a trade-off in timing decisions and may guide shared decision-making for surgical planning in patients with cleft lip.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wei K, Buzi A, Phung C, Yu Y, Rizzi MD, Binenbaum G&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70091'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70091&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41582702/'&gt;41582702&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of systemic steroids for children with orbital complications of sinusitis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital, January 2017 to June 2023. METHODS: Hospitalized children were classified by whether they received systemic corticosteroids, in addition to systemic antibiotics, prior to any surgery. Primary outcomes were length of admission, need for orbital/sinus surgery, readmission, vision loss, and fungal infection. Multivariable regression controlled for potential confounders, including severity of disease on initial imaging study. RESULTS: Of 222 children with orbital cellulitis (mean age 8.6 years), 26 (12%) received steroids: 17 (65%) intravenous methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, 9 (35%) oral steroids; 16 (62%) 1 day and 10 (38%) 2 to 4 days of steroids. Children receiving steroids more often had proptosis (58% vs 37%, P = .045) and orbital abscess on CT (81% vs 69%, P = .004). Steroid use was associated with decreased orbital or sinus surgery (19% vs 37%; OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9; P = .03). There were no differences in length of stay (P = .2), readmission (P = .4), or vision loss (no cases) between the study groups or fungal or secondary infection (no cases). CONCLUSION: Systemic steroid use in children with orbital cellulitis was not associated with adverse outcomes, such as vision loss or readmission, and may offer potential benefits, including avoidance of surgery in some cases. A majority received only 1 day of steroids in our study; further research might evaluate the effects of longer courses and the subjective experience of children who have periocular swelling and pain.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jaleel Z, Aboueisha M, Adcock K, Leong S, Martinez V, Kinney G, Perkel DJ, Bhatt NK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70106'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70106&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41582699/'&gt;41582699&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Aging is a risk factor for diminished laryngeal sensation, dysphagia, and aspiration events; however, the mechanisms underlying age-related swallow dysfunction are not well understood. Some of these changes are thought to be mediated through superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of aging on SLN motor and sensory function in a rat model. STUDY DESIGN: Animal study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center. METHODS: Evoked response studies were performed by SLN stimulation. Outcome measures included compound motor (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) measurements recorded from the cricothyroid muscle and the internal branch of the SLN, respectively. Swallow force measurements were recorded by stimulating the SLN and quantifying the hyoid elevation force. Additionally, force and frequency of electrically and tactile-stimulated swallow reflex were analyzed. These measures were collected in adult Sprague-Dawley rats aged 4, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: Compared to non-aged rats, advanced age was associated with significantly longer SNAP latency and total duration with a mean difference (95% CI) of 1.23 milliseconds (1.06-1.40) and 2.24 milliseconds (1.89-2.59), respectively. CMAP latency and total duration were also increased by 0.27 milliseconds (0.23-0.31) and 1.5 milliseconds (1.14-1.87), respectively. Advanced age was associated with decreased electrical and tactile-stimulated swallow frequency with a mean difference of 3.3 swallows/10 seconds (95% CI 1.1-5.5) and 2.1 swallows/10 seconds (95% CI 0.71-3.5), respectively. CONCLUSION: Advanced age was associated with longer SNAP and CMAP duration and decreased swallow frequency. The results suggest delayed nerve conduction as a potential mechanism for age-related swallow dysfunction in our rat model. Our work has implications in humans with the hopes for developing targeted therapies for age-related swallow dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sheeja A, Menon JR, Issac ME, Aravindakshan R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/00034894251407783'&gt;10.1177/00034894251407783&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581007/'&gt;41581007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) causes denervation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles in varying degrees and results in different types of glottal configurations. While the primary goal of surgery is to improve vocal function, outcomes are strongly influenced by how effectively the underlying laryngeal physiology and alignment are restored. Denervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle causes the arytenoid to fall anteriorly and medially. Static procedures such as medialization thyroplasty does not address this. This study evaluates the impact of non-selective laryngeal reinnervation (LR) on arytenoid position and vocal function. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 41 patients with UVFP who underwent Non selective reinnervation between 2021 and 2024 at a tertiary care hospital. Arytenoid prolapse was graded using a 3-point scale from laryngoscopy videos pre- and 6 months post-operatively. Voice outcomes were assessed using Maximum Phonation Duration (MPD) and Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10). RESULTS: Improvement in arytenoid position was defined as an upgrade by at least one grade in the prolapse grading system.70.7% of the patients showed improvement in arytenoid position 6 months post non selective reinnervation surgery. Significant postoperative improvements were observed in both MPD and VHI-10 scores (P &lt; 0.01), correlating with arytenoid stabilization and improved phonatory function. CONCLUSION: Non-selective reinnervation not only improves vocal quality but also restores arytenoid position, addressing a key component of glottic insufficiency in UVFP. These findings support reinnervation as a physiologic, durable solution with functional and anatomic advantages over static medialization.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; De Nys L&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of geriatric oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102854'&gt;10.1016/j.jgo.2026.102854&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581430/'&gt;41581430&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Older adults with cancer face disproportionately high rates of severe treatment-related toxicities, yet current prediction tools rarely incorporate biomarkers that capture physiological resilience. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-central to stress adaptation, immune regulation, and tissue repair-undergoes pronounced age-related alterations, including elevated basal cortisol, reduced dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate form DHEAS, and an increased cortisol:DHEA(S) ratio. These changes may impair immune function, delay recovery, and exacerbate vulnerability to treatment toxicity. This narrative review synthesizes mechanistic and clinical evidence linking HPA-axis dysregulation to treatment tolerance in geriatric oncology. Common patterns include blunted diurnal cortisol slopes, elevated evening cortisol, and low DHEA(S), which are associated with fatigue, functional decline, and reduced survival across cancer types. However, their predictive value for acute treatment toxicities remains underexplored due to methodological heterogeneity, lack of age-specific reference ranges, and absence from existing geriatric toxicity models. This review proposes a translational roadmap that prioritizes (1) standardization of salivary cortisol/DHEA(S) protocols; (2) prospective, age-stratified validation studies using standardized toxicity endpoints; (3) interventional testing of behavioral or pharmacological strategies to modulate HPA function; and (4) integration into oncology workflows and electronic decision-support tools. Incorporating endocrine biomarkers into risk prediction could refine treatment stratification, enable targeted supportive care, and ultimately improve outcomes for older patients with cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Podobnik G, Ibragimov B, Peterlin P, Strojan P, Vrtovec T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111387'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111387&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581701/'&gt;41581701&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To extend the previously reported geometric analysis of HaN-Seg: The Head and Neck Organ-at-Risk CT and MR Segmentation Challenge by integrating a dosimetric evaluation, thereby offering a comprehensive assessment of challenge results with practical insights into their clinical applicability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participating teams of the HaN-Seg challenge were tasked to auto-segment 30 organs-at-risk (OARs) in the head and neck region using paired contrast-enhanced computed tomography and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. The teams were ranked according to their geometric performance, measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Here, we extend this evaluation with a forward dosimetric analysis, also known as dosimetric impact approximation, including the verification of OAR dosimetric restriction compliance, assessment of OAR priority ratings, evaluation of segmentation performance relative to tumor proximity, and correlation analysis between geometric and dosimetric metrics. RESULTS: All six teams from the previous geometric analysis were assessed for dosimetric performance on the original 14 test cases. Dosimetric analysis revealed minor performance differences among teams, with the best- and worst-performing teams achieving dosimetric compliance in 70.7% and 67.7% of OAR auto-segmentations, respectively. Most teams successfully met priority 1 dosimetric restrictions including the spinal cord, brainstem, optic chiasm, and optic nerves in 11 out of 14 test cases. The lowest compliance rates were observed for the oral cavity and submandibular glands. Correlation analysis revealed no clear relationship between geometric and dosimetric metrics. CONCLUSION: The high dosimetric compliance highlights the practical utility of deep learning OAR auto-segmentation methods. Lower compliance for the oral cavity and submandibular glands most probably stems from their proximity to tumors and the corresponding steep dose gradients, where certain dosimetric constraints are inherently challenging to meet in clinical practice, or from the limitations of the forward dosimetric analysis. These findings underpin the critical need for both geometric and dosimetric evaluations of OAR auto-segmentation tools to ensure robust validation. Such a comprehensive assessment will be essential as commercial deep learning tools become increasingly integrated into the radiotherapy planning workflow.</description>

While osteocutaneous MFTTs are the preferred option, some patients require soft tissue-only MFTTs due to medical or anatomic limitations. Data comparing hardware exposure risk between these approaches are limited. This study compares the rate and timing of hardware exposure between osteocutaneous and soft tissue MFTTs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing MFTT for mandibular defects at a tertiary care center (11/2011-6/2023). Patients with non-mandibular defects or under age 18 were excluded. The primary exposure was flap type (osteocutaneous vs. soft tissue). The primary outcome was time to hardware exposure; the secondary outcome was exposure rate at defined follow-up intervals. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-eight patients met inclusion criteria. At 1 year, hardware exposure occurred in 5.2% of osteocutaneous and 8.7% of soft tissue MFTT patients. At 3 years, exposure increased to 14.2% and 17.4%, respectively. After adjustment, there was no significant difference in time to hardware exposure between flap types at 1 year [HR 1.69 (95% CI 0.34-8.37), p = 0.520] or 3 years [HR 1.69 (95% CI 0.59-4.43), p = 0.346]. Adjuvant radiation and/or chemoradiation was associated with increased hazard of hardware exposure at 1 year [HR 7.72 (95% CI 0.97-61.4), p = 0.053] and at 3 years [HR 3.68 (95% CI 1.38-9.78), p = 0.009]. CONCLUSIONS: Flap type was not associated with differences in hardware exposure timing, but adjuvant therapy significantly increased exposure risk. Exposure rates rose by ~10% from 1 to 3 years postoperatively.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The 161 chronic laryngitis patients, 55 with vocal cord polyps, and 44 normal controls were studied at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, from June 2024 to January 2025. Voice quality, aerodynamic parameters, and thyrohyoid space were assessed using VHI-10, GRBAS scale, voice analysis, aerodynamic profiling, palpation scoring, and ultrasound. Data analysis was conducted using Python. RESULTS: Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in VHI-10 scores, G, R, B, S, Jitter, and Shimmer are observed between male and female vocal cord polyp groups. Aerodynamic analysis indicates distinct variations in mean airflow rate across both genders (p &lt; 0.05), while maximum phonation time and subglottic pressure differ significantly in females alone (p &lt; 0.05). Palpation scores for the thyrohyoid space and F0 do not show substantial differences (p &gt; 0.05) between groups. Conversely, real-time ultrasound evaluations of the thyrohyoid space, including pre-phonation/phonation minimum distances (left/right), rates of unilateral (left/right) narrowing, and maximum narrowing rate, exhibit notable differences (p &lt; 0.05) across three groups. CONCLUSION: Real-time ultrasound measurement of the thyroid-hyoid gap is simple, feasible, and provides a more quantitative assessment of VHM than subjective palpation or vocal aerodynamic measures. It therefore represents a useful clinical tool for evaluating voice function.</description>

Planarians possess a unique configuration of organs embedded in a vast pool of pluripotent stem cells. How stem cells integrate positional information with discrete fates remains unknown. Here, we use the planarian pharynx to define the cell fates that depend on the pioneer transcription factor FoxA. We find that Roundabout receptor RoboA suppresses aberrant pharynx cell fates by altering foxA expression, independent of the canonical ligand Slit. An RNAi screen for extracellular proteins identifies Anosmin1a as a potential partner of RoboA. Perturbing global patterning demonstrates that roboA/anosmin1a functions locally in the brain. By contrast, altering pharynx fate with foxA knockdown induces head-specific neurons in the pharynx, indicating a latent plasticity of stem cells. Our data links critical extracellular cues with cell fate decisions of highly plastic stem cells, ensuring the fidelity of organ regeneration.</description>

Although pilocarpine, an exogenous muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist, can stimulate salivation experimentally, the endogenous control of saliva secretion by acetylcholine remains poorly understood. Here, we identify and characterise two pharmacologically distinct mAChRs (type A and B) in the genome of the medically important tick Ixodes ricinus. Molecular dynamics simulations and targeted mutagenesis reveal that type B mAChRs exhibit an atypical muscarinic profile, suggesting unconventional receptor signalling. Combining immunolabelling, in vivo pharmacology, and proteomics, we show that specific central neurons interact with distinct salivary gland regions via mAChR type-specific axons, coordinating fluid and protein secretion through separate acini and likely acting upstream of a neuropeptide-dependent cascade. This previously unrecognised mechanism of neural control offers new insights into how ticks modulate their saliva advancing our understanding of vector-host interactions, with potential implications for disrupting pathogen transmission.</description>

In Japan, a novel extraction method has been developed and patented that enable the simultaneous production of proteoglycan and undenatured collagen from salmon nasal cartilage. This study evaluated the subchronic oral toxicity of this extract mixture (SCP Complex-LS, containing 40% proteoglycan and 40% undenatured collagen) in a 90-day repeated toxicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats, following by a 14-day recovery period. Rats (20/group; 10 males and 10 females) were administered SCP Complex-LS once daily by oral gavage at doses of 0 (vehicle), 10.3, 20.6, or 41.2 mg/kg body weight/day, with additional recovery groups (10/groups; 5 males and 5 females) receiving vehicle or the high dose. Clinical endpoints included mortality, clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, estrous cyclicity, ophthalmoscopy, clinical pathology, organ weights, gross pathology, and histopathology. No deaths or test item-related clinical signs were observed. Sporadic changes in hematological, biochemical, urinary, or organ weight parameters occurred in some dose groups but were small in magnitude, showed no consistent dose-response relationship, and were not corroborated by histopathological alterations. Histopathology revealed only minimal findings, such as mild inflammation or congestion in the liver, kidneys, and lungs, occurring at low incidence and with similar frequency in both control and high-dose groups. Estrous cycles remained within normal limits, and recovery groups showed no evidence of delayed or irreversible toxicity. Based on these findings, the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for SCP Complex-LS was determined to be 41.2 mg/kg body weight/day in Sprague-Dawley rats under the conditions of this study, supporting its safety for use as a food ingredient within the expected range of human intake.</description>

After acute infection, FMDV persists in the upper respiratory tract of about 50% of infected cattle. The persistent infection is characterized by very localized viral replication in the absence of clinical signs, but the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In our study, we investigated tissue samples collected from 20 cattle which had been experimentally infected with FMDV O/FRA/1/2001. In 17 animals, the infection persisted for longer than 28 days. Epithelial tissue from the dorsal nasopharynx and the dorsal soft palate (DSP), the two main locations for persistent infection, was collected at necropsy. Five biological replicates from each animal and location were screened by FMDV specific RT-qPCR, and subsets of the samples were selected for transcriptome sequencing (n = 52) and protein mass spectrometry (n = 18). There was a good correlation between the expression patterns identified by the transcriptomic and proteomic analysis. Higher loads of viral genome were detected in DSP samples. Overexpression of cellular markers for follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) and downregulated genes of epithelial integrity and keratinization correlated with viral genome loads, confirming the microanatomic localization of persistent FMDV infection in follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) in lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx. An upregulation of genes which negatively influence T-cell responses indicates a T-cell exhaustion, most likely caused by prolonged immune stimulation. Moreover, decreased expression levels of RIG-I and TRAF6 probably resulted in inhibited detection of viral RNA by the innate immune system and ultimately an impeded type I interferon response. These observations are in line with the hypothesis that FMDV actively suppresses the local immunity in FAE to maintain a persistent infection in the bovine nasopharynx.</description>

Previous work has shown that expression of leucine-rich G protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), a Wnt pathway agonist, serves as a marker of adult stem/progenitor cells for taste buds located in posterior tongue (circumvallate and foliate), but not anterior tongue (fungiform), taste papillae. However, the specific location/niche of the Lgr5-expressing cells supporting renewal and their phenotypic properties have not been fully explored. To address this, the genesis and fate of Lgr5+ cells were examined in developing and adult mice using genetic reporter strains. Evidence from Lgr5-lacZ and Lgr5-GFP mice shows that, while Lgr5 is broadly expressed in the epithelium of nascent circumvallate papillae and their trenches during embryonic development, it becomes concentrated within the ducts of adjacent von Ebner's salivary glands during the first postnatal week, co-incident with the appearance of differentiated taste buds. In posterior tongue taste papillae of adult animals, sites of highest Lgr5-lacZ and Lgr5-GFP expression are found in excretory ducts, restricted to the outer (basal) layer of the bi-layered excretory zone. These Lgr5+ cells are immunoreactive for keratin 14, like cells in the basal layer of extragemmal taste epithelium, and are often seen to express Sox9, a marker of exocrine gland duct cells. Lineage tracing experiments with an Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2; mTmG reporter show that Lgr5+ ductal cells become labeled one day following Cre induction, prior to the appearance of descendent cells in taste buds. Overall, the data support a role for Lgr5+ ductal cells as stem cells and suggest that a cooperative interaction exists between posterior taste epithelium and its associated salivary glands in taste cell turnover.</description>

We report preclinical and phase 1c (NCT06808815) results for DC-806, a small molecule interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitor, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate psoriasis. Preclinical results demonstrated DC-806 targets IL-17AA and IL-17AF with secukinumab-like therapeutic efficacy. In the phase 1c trial, 32 patients consented to receive twice daily (BID) doses of placebo or DC-806 (200 mg or 800 mg) for 28 days. No serious adverse events (SAEs) or discontinuations due to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred. In an exploratory analysis, adjusted mean percentage reductions from baseline in psoriasis area and severity indices (PASI) at Day 29 were 43.7%, 15.1%, and 13.3% for 800 mg BID, 200 mg BID, and placebo arms, respectively (800 mg BID vs placebo, P value = 0.0008). DC-806 was found to be well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile and preliminary signals of clinical efficacy in mild-to-moderate psoriasis. EudraCT Identifier: 2021-002888-21.</description>

The retention of these posts depends on the bond strength to the dentin structure and may vary significantly along the root thirds. PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different luting materials and root thirds on the bonding strength of glass fiber posts to radicular dentin after hydrothermal aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy bovine incisors were divided into 7 groups (n = 10), according to the luting materials: Panavia V5 (PV5), Rebilda DC (RDC), LuxaCore Z (LCZ), Allcem Core (ACC), RelyX Ultimate (RXU), RelyX U200 (RXU200) or Fuji Plus (FP). After posts cementation, the roots were thermocycled (10,000 cycles; 5-55°C), sectioned into thirds, and tested for push-out bond strength (2.0 kN; 0.5 mm/min). Failure patterns were classified using a stereomicroscope, according to the material and root third. Data were statistically analyzed (α = 0.05). RESULTS: Bond strength significantly differed among root thirds for PV5, ACC, RXU, and RXU200 (p &lt; 0.05), while no significant differences were found for RDC, LCZ, and FP (p ≥ 0.05). PV5 and RXU exhibited the highest overall bond strength values. PV5 presented means of 14.97 ± 3.68 MPa (cervical), 11.08 ± 3.12 MPa (middle), and 10.47 ± 2.45 MPa (apical), while RXU showed 16.97 ± 4.22 MPa, 16.48 ± 3.61 MPa, and 6.51 ± 1.26 MPa, respectively. Overall, PV5 and RXU demonstrated superior and more consistent bond strength across root thirds, whereas the other cements displayed lower and more heterogeneous results. CONCLUSIONS: The luting material influenced the bond strength of glass fiber posts to intraradicular dentin. Dual-cure resin cements with self-etch adhesive systems that contain functional monomers, such as PV5 and RXU, achieved more predictable adhesion, particularly in deep and complex regions. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Analysis of bond strength and failure patterns supports clinical decision-making by identifying luting cements with superior retention, even in challenging regions, contributing to greater treatment longevity.</description>

Periplaneta americana extract (PAD), a raw material used in Kangfuxin Liquid and Yunnan Baiyao toothpaste, contains a variety of growth factors such as polypeptides and sticky sugar amino acids that promote tissue repair; this can encourage the growth of granulation tissue and reduce inflammation on wound surfaces. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we used a rat model of ROU induced by an antigen emulsifier to assess the ameliorative effects of PAD on rat ROUs and to explore its mechanism of action. METHODS: The effect of PAD in rats was evaluated by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, hematoxylin-eosin staining, immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), and Western Blot (WB). 16S rRNA sequencing and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) were used to detect the changes in intestinal flora and its metabolite short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in the feces of rats, respectively. RESULTS: PAD significantly reduced the infiltration of local inflammatory cells and significantly downregulated interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), while upregulating IL-2, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In addition, PAD altered the diversity and abundance of the gut microbiota and increased fecal short-chain fatty acid levels. Notably, PAD can improve the pathological injury of the colon, enhance the intestinal barrier of the colon, and reduce the apoptosis of colon cells. CONCLUSION: The oral administration of PAD may effectively treat ROUs via regulating metabolites and altering the composition of the intestinal microbiota, thereby improving the intestinal barrier function.</description>

G6PD-D is assessed using genotyping or an enzymatic assay, but because G6PD-D is X-linked, the enzymatic assay is necessary for determining status for women heterozygous for deficiency variants. We assessed: 1) ability of HbA1c to detect Abnl-GT by G6PD-D; 2) concordance of genotyping and enzymatic assay for G6PD-D in sub-Saharan Africans living in the US. 534 participants of the Africans in America study were included, with HbA1c ranging from 3.1-11.3%. Abnl-GT determined by HbA1c (≥5.7%) was compared to the diagnostic standard, the oral glucose tolerance test (fasting glucose≥100 mg/dL and/or 2h glucose≥140 mg/dL). G6PD-D status was determined by genotype (n = 263), enzymatic assay (n = 83), or both (n = 188). G6PD-D could not be determined for 13 women heterozygotes with only genotype data. In the remaining participants, HbA1c was 0.9% lower among those with G6PD-D (4.6 ± 0.5; range 3.1-5.6) compared to those with normal G6PD activity (5.5 ± 0.6; range 4.2-11.3; P &lt; 0.001). Glucose concentrations did not differ between groups. HbA1c sensitivity and specificity for Abnl-GT were 0% (0/17) and 100% (37/37) among those with G6PD-D, and 50% (98/195) and 80% (217/272) among those with normal activity. After excluding women heterozygotes, concordance for G6PD-D detection by genotype and the enzymatic assay was 100%. G6PD-D was associated with ~0.9% lower HbA1c in this study, leading to a failure of HbA1c to identify Abnl-GT in these participants. Such a dramatic difference in a screening tool could have consequences in practice, including late diagnosis, undertreatment, and increased complications among those with G6PD-D. Additionally, the results for the enzymatic assay were perfectly concordant with the genotype results for G6PD-D. However, as genotype alone cannot predict G6PD-D in heterozygous women, the enzymatic assay was more informative.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gupta AK, Ablona A, Consolacion TB, Bartlett S, Beck S, Burchell AN, Darvishian M, Alvarez MJ, Yu A, Wong S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers &amp; prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-0890'&gt;10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-25-0890&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41575736/'&gt;41575736&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Anal squamous cell carcinoma, caused by human papillomavirus disproportionately affects people living with HIV (PLWH), particularly gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). New guidelines recommend screening and treatment of pre-cancerous lesions. We aimed to estimate anal cancer incidence by HIV status, sex, and GBM status in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: Using administrative health databases, we assessed anal cancer stratified by HIV-status, sex, and sexual orientation from 1990 to 2019. A phenotypic algorithm was used to classify GBM status. We evaluated the comparative incidence of anal cancer using Fine and Gray's competing risks sub-distribution hazards model. Hazard ratios were estimated and adjusted for age, healthcare utilization, urbanicity, and Charlson co-morbidity index. RESULTS: Among 571 anal cancer diagnoses assessed, the incidence was highest among GBM with HIV (78.09 per 100,000 person-years [PY]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.24-99.58) followed by heterosexual males with HIV (44.49 per 100,000 PY; 95% CI = 29.56-66.95), and females with HIV (12.05 per 100,000 PY; 95% CI = 4.52-32.11). GBM with HIV experience a 76-fold increased anal cancer risk compared with heterosexual men without HIV (aHR 76.08; 95% CI 55.14-104.97). CONCLUSIONS: There is an unmet need in anal cancer prevention among PLWH. Screening strategies that are sensitive, specific, acceptable, and cost-effective are necessary. IMPACT: This study provides the first population-based estimates of anal cancer incidence by HIV and GBM status in British Columbia, highlighting disparities and rising trends. These findings support prioritizing targeted screening programs and improving access to care.</description>

We studied the incidence of lymphoma, multiple myeloma and leukaemia in relation to the raion-average age-specific cumulative absorbed red bone marrow (RBM) dose among the residents of Gomel and Mogilev oblasts in Belarus, which were highly contaminated. The follow-up period was 40 years (1978-2018). HM cases and population size data were received from the Belarusian national cancer registry and the state department of statistics. Our ecological study included 7328 lymphoma, 9476 leukaemia and 2003 multiple myeloma incident cases and 90.8 million person-years in people who were born before the accident and have attained age &lt;80 years old. The mean (median) RBM dose accumulated by December 31, 2018 was 14.2 (6.4) mGy. We found no evidence of increased risks of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma or total leukaemia associated with two-year lagged raion-average cumulative RBM dose after adjustment for sex, attained age, urban/rural status and calendar period effects. There was a suggestion of an elevated relative risk of myeloid leukaemia per 100 mGy after exclusion of Gomel and Mogilev cities. Little evidence was found on interaction between selected factors, except sex, and RBM dose for each study outcome. Studies with individually reconstructed cumulative absorbed RBM doses are warranted to provide more insight on dose-effect relationships between HM risk, specifically leukaemia, and protracted environmental exposure at a low dose range.</description>

Typical cases involve the parotid gland and are caused by Staphylococcus aureus infection. Contributing factors include prematurity, dehydration, prolonged hospitalisation, and immature immunity. Sequential bilateral gland involvement through haematogenous spread is rare, and presents significant management challenges in prematurity. PRESENTATION: We report the case of a preterm infant, born at 30 weeks gestation, who spontaneously developed acute left-sided parotid swelling at 3 weeks old in NICU. Inflammatory markers were significantly elevated and blood cultures grew Staphylococcus epidermidis. Initial treatment was with broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, and after no significant improvement, confirmatory ultrasound, and subsequent bedside percutaneous drainage was performed by ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeons. Subsequently, they developed a second abscess in the contralateral submandibular gland, needing further bedside aspiration. Pus cultures isolated Staphylococcus aureus, and they improved with culture-driven antibiotics. DISCUSSION: We highlight the importance of combining early antimicrobial therapy with minimally invasive procedural intervention in managing NSS, as well as the rarity of multiple, sequential gland involvement. Early drainage limits progression when empirical treatment fails and helps guide antimicrobial choice. It minimises the need for more invasive surgical intervention, which is complex in preterm infants. CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion, early minimally invasive drainage and prompt initiation of targeted antibiotics, are key to optimal outcomes in NSS, particularly in preterm infants at higher risk of severe disease.</description>

Our objective is to compare the workup and management of variant (i.e., normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism (NCPHPT) and normohormonal hyperparathyroidism (NHPHPT)) to classic hyperparathyroidism (CPHPT), taking into account localization studies, surgical considerations, utility of intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH), and surveillance to identify gaps in knowledge that limit management outcomes of variant PHPT presentations. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted from June 11, 2024, to March 17, 2025, using MeSH terms and free-text queries focused on imaging, surgery, and outcomes in PHPT and reported using PRISMA ScR guidelines. REVIEW METHODS: Peer-reviewed studies addressing surgical management of PHPT in adults, published in English, were included. Two reviewers independently screened all titles, abstracts, and full texts using previously developed inclusion criteria recorded in a shared spreadsheet. Twenty-seven studies were included. Data were synthesized into a flow diagram to identify areas in need of further guidance. RESULTS: Imaging accuracy was highest with 4DCT and PET scans in both classic and variant PHPT, particularly in the setting of multiglandular disease. Not obtaining ≥ 50% IOPTH drop and/or levels below 40 pg/mL are risk factors for persistence or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: PHPT has varied presentations that demand nuanced approaches. Our review highlights knowledge gaps that, if addressed, will improve the care of patients with variant PHPT. Further prospective validation of this algorithmic summary is warranted to improve long-term impact and patient outcomes.</description>

Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified risk genes such as PDE8B, critical gaps remain in the annotation of causal variants in non-coding regions, characterization of tissue-specific regulatory networks, and understanding of ethnic heterogeneity. This study aimed to systematically identify genes associated with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and unravel their underlying molecular mechanisms through multi-omics integration. METHODS: We included data from the ThyroidOmics Consortium, comprising 1,840 hyperthyroidism cases (49,983 controls) and 3,340 hypothyroidism cases (49,983 controls). Core candidate genes were prioritized using a combination of SMR-HEIDI analysis, cross-tissue transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS), mBAT-combo rare variant analysis, and polygenic priority score (PoPS). GTEx colocalization (coloc) analysis was used to validate tissue-specific colocalization between these candidate genes and disease signals. Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS), KEGG pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were performed to explore gene functions, with potential targeted drugs predicted using the Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB). RESULTS: Cross-validation by four methods identified FAM227B, PDE8B, and PDE10A as key genes for hyperthyroidism, and PDE8B as the critical gene for hypothyroidism. GTEx coloc analysis (with PP4 &gt; 0.8 as the threshold) confirmed significant colocalization: FAM227B with hyperthyroidism signals in the adrenal gland, lung, and minor salivary gland; PDE8B with both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism signals in thyroid tissue; and PDE10A with hyperthyroidism signals in thyroid tissue. As a core member of the phosphodiesterase family, PDE8B exhibited bidirectional regulatory characteristics in thyroid hormone synthesis via the cAMP signaling pathway and nucleotide metabolism network: its inhibition promoted hormone synthesis in hypothyroidism, while its interaction with PDE10A suppressed overactive cAMP signaling in hyperthyroidism. PheWAS linked FAM227B to cardiovascular diseases and PDE10A to neurological pathways. KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted the "morphine addiction" pathway (p = 6.12 × 10 ⁻ ⁵), suggesting potential neuroendocrine crosstalk. Notably, potential drugs targeting FAM227B, PDE8B, and PDE10A were identified. CONCLUSION: Through multi-omics integration, this study identifies PDE8B as a central gene associated with thyroid dysfunction, characterized by tissue-specific colocalization, and elucidates its critical roles in signaling pathways, comorbidity associations, and drug targeting. These findings provide insights into the bidirectional regulatory mechanisms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism and a theoretical basis for developing phosphodiesterase family-based precision therapies. It should be noted that all samples in this study are of European ancestry, and the generalizability of the results in other ethnic groups remains to be verified.</description>

However, the monovalent-inactivated vaccine is ineffective against HFMD with other etiologies. To date, little is known about the epidemiological patterns and the replacement of the predominant pathogens that induce HFMD after the universal vaccination campaign. METHODS: Using HFMD surveillance and VP1 sequencing data in pre- and post-vaccination periods, time series analysis, and Wavelet approaches, we identified pathogen replacement, changes in the viral spectrum and epidemiological patterns of HFMD. RESULTS: A prolonged but lower peak of HFMD occurred in the spring, and a late, higher peak presented during fall in the post-vaccination period. The typical half-year transmission cycle disappeared, the one-year cycle did not change, and the CVA16 and CVA6 serotypes have the potential to replace EV-A71 as the predominant strains. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic pattern of HFMD has shifted after the vaccination campaign. While the EV-A71 vaccine reduced transmission in the spring season, it had little impact on reducing cases in fall. Meanwhile, potential new predominant strains have emerged. Public health system should incorporate enhanced surveillance by including whole genome sequencing to ensure close monitoring of serotype replacement and to assess the need for multivalent vaccines across Southern China.</description>

In this study, we propose a multimodal strategy that combines Raman spectroscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to investigate the molecular and morphological features of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Raman spectroscopy was used to analyze biochemical signatures across different tissue regions tumor, necrotic, stromal, and glandular within the 813-1668 cm-1 range, identifying distinct molecular profiles between malignant and healthy areas. Specific vibrational peaks associated with DNA, proteins, and lipids were examined to track molecular changes related to tumor progression. AFM enabled nanoscale mapping of surface morphology, revealing structural irregularities associated with malignancy, while SEM provided detailed imaging of cellular and extracellular architecture, enhancing the visualization of cancer-induced morphological alterations. Although Raman spectroscopy has been studied for decades in cancer research, it has not yet replaced Pap smears and biopsies in clinical practice due to challenges in standardization, reproducibility, and clinical validation. This pilot study aims to serve as a stepping stone toward that goal, providing proof-of-concept data that may support the gradual translation of Raman spectroscopy into clinically relevant diagnostic workflows and underscores the potential of the technique, supported by complementary high-resolution imaging techniques, in the characterization of cervical cancer tissues. The integration of Raman, AFM, and SEM was used here as a pilot approach on paraffin-embedded samples, with AFM and SEM providing supportive morphological information while the long-term aim is to transfer Raman spectroscopy to fresh, untreated tissues, where its non-destructive and label-free nature could enable minimally invasive diagnostic applications.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To determine if nalbuphine extended release (ER), a κ opioid receptor agonist and μ-opioid receptor antagonist, decreases cough compared with placebo in patients with IPF-associated cough. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b trial conducted at 52 sites in 10 countries, patients with IPF, chronic cough for at least 8 weeks, and a Cough Severity Numerical Rating Scale (0, no cough; 10, worst possible cough) score of 4 or higher were enrolled from February 2024 to February 2025, with last follow-up in April 2025. Statistical analyses were conducted from May to August 2025. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive nalbuphine ER at doses of 27 mg, 54 mg, or 108 mg or placebo twice daily for 6 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the relative change from baseline in 24-hour cough frequency (coughs/h), measured with a digital cough monitor, for nalbuphine ER compared with placebo at week 6. The key secondary outcome was the relative change from baseline in the patient-reported cough frequency (Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in IPF cough subscale; scores range from 0-4, lower scores indicate lesser cough frequency) at week 6. RESULTS: Of the 223 patients screened, 165 were randomized (42, 43, 40, and 40 to receive nalbuphine ER 27 mg, 54 mg, and 108 mg, and placebo, respectively) and 160 were included in the primary analysis (median age, 71 [range, 51-85] years; 28.5% female). The baseline mean (SD) cough count was 28.3 (27.4) coughs/h. In the nalbuphine ER 27 mg, 54 mg, and 108 mg twice-daily groups, the mean relative decrease in the cough count and the absolute decrease in coughs/h were 47.9% (from 24.6 to 11.9; P = .008), 53.4% (from 28.0 to 14.9; P &lt; .001), and 60.2% (from 31.5 to 11.9; P &lt; .001), respectively, compared with placebo (16.9%; from 29.4 to 28.1 coughs/h). For the key secondary outcome of patient-reported cough frequency at week 6, the relative and absolute changes were -31.4% (from 2.3 to 1.5; P = .14), -40.6% (from 2.6 to 1.4; P = .004), and -40.2% (from 2.4 to 1.4; P &lt; .005) in the 27-mg, 54-mg, and 108-mg groups, respectively, compared with -21.9% (from 2.6 to 1.9) with placebo. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For patients with IPF-associated chronic cough, all 3 doses of nalbuphine ER reduced objective cough frequency and the 2 higher doses improved patient-reported cough frequency at 6 weeks.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Nowak E, Viëtor CL, Feelders RA, Hofland J, Castro MA, Ojeda CM, Pascual-Corrales E, Salama B, Bancos I, Sandooja R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The lancet. Diabetes &amp; endocrinology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00302-X'&gt;10.1016/S2213-8587(25)00302-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579871/'&gt;41579871&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Treatment for patients with bilateral adrenal tumours and cortisol excess is not standardised and poses a therapeutic dilemma. Untreated cortisol excess is associated with cardiometabolic morbidity and mortality, but bilateral adrenalectomy causes adrenal insufficiency and possibly life-threatening adrenal crises. Data on cardiovascular outcomes by treatment modality are scarce. In this study we aimed to evaluate mid-term and long-term clinical and biochemical outcomes in patients with bilateral adrenal tumours and cortisol excess by treatment strategy and diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective, international cohort study (in 30 centres across 10 countries in Europe plus Singapore and the USA) included patients with bilateral adrenal tumours of 10 mm or larger, post-dexamethasone serum cortisol concentration of 50 nmol/L or higher, and at least 36 months of follow-up, with data collection beween Feb 2, 2024, and Jan 31, 2025. Patients were excluded if they had adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH)-dependent cortisol excess, ACTH-dependent nodular adrenal hyperplasia, partial glucocorticoid resistance syndrome, a diagnosis inconsistent with benign adrenocortical lesions, or received systemic oral or intravenous glucocorticoids other than replacement therapy following adrenalectomy. Primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and clinical and biochemical remission rates. Secondary endpoints were the incidence of cardiovascular events, prevalence of vascular and metabolic comorbidities, and incidence of adrenal crises. FINDINGS: Of 629 patients who were diagnosed between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 31, 2022, 105 (17%) had Cushing's syndrome and 524 (83%) had mild autonomous cortisol secretion (MACS), median age was 62 years (IQR 54·0-68·0), and 426 (68%) were female. 85 (81%) of 105 patients with Cushing's syndrome underwent surgery, and 384 (73%) of 524 patients with MACS received non-specific symptomatic treatment (ie, never underwent adrenalectomy or received steroidogenesis inhibitors). Over a median follow-up of 6·8 years, biochemical remission was achieved in 46 (45%) of 102 patients with Cushing's syndrome and in 67 (13%) of 517 patients with MACS. In both groups, 7% of patients died (Cushing's syndrome: seven of 105; MACS: 38 of 524) and 12% (13 of 105) of patients with Cushing's syndrome and 16% (82 of 524) of those with MACS had at least one cardiovascular event, without substantial differences across treatments. Smoking emerged as key modifiable mortality and cardiovascular risk factor in all patients, and in patients with MACS who only received non-specific symptomatic therapy, post-dexamethasone cortisol was also associated with increased mortality. Bilateral adrenalectomy led to full biochemical remission, few non-fatal adrenal crises, and improved arterial hypertension. Unilateral adrenalectomy and steroidogenesis inhibitors yielded heterogeneous biochemical outcomes and no substantial comorbidity improvement. Non-specific symptomatic treatment in MACS was associated with worsening of all investigated comorbidities. INTERPRETATION: Although mortality and cardiovascular event rates were similar across treatments, surgery led to better biochemical control and more favourable comorbidity outcomes. FUNDING: None.</description>

Given their location and/or rapid progression, surgical resection is frequently not feasible, even in those with localized diseases. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy has proven largely ineffective against angiosarcoma. In this prospective, phase II study, we evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of paclitaxel plus avelumab as first-line therapy for unresectable angiosarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic angiosarcomas, who did not receive systemic treatment. Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) was intravenously infused on days 1, 8, and 15 of every 28-days cycle; avelumab (10 mg/kg) was intravenously infused every 2 weeks. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and safety profiles. RESULTS: The final analysis included 32 patients (21 male and 11 female). The median age was 63.5 years (range 27-82 years). The ORR was 50.0% (n = 16), including one complete response. Median OS and PFS were 14.5 [95% confidence interval (CI) 9.4-24.6 months] and 6.0 (95% CI 5.4-9.5 months), respectively. Among patients who received at least one treatment dose (n = 33), adverse events (AEs) of any grade were reported in 90.9% (n = 30), and severe AEs in 12.1% (n = 4), including one death. The most common hematologic and non-hematologic AEs were neutropenia (n = 13, 39.4%) and pain (n = 12, 36.4%). Immune-related pneumonitis was reported in two patients. CONCLUSION: Avelumab plus weekly paclitaxel demonstrated preliminary evidence of efficacy and tolerability in inoperable angiosarcoma. Given the rarity of angiosarcoma, further multicenter, collaborative, and translational studies are warranted.</description>

Capivasertib is a selective AKT inhibitor recommended with fulvestrant for patients with PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN-altered ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. Here, we report data from Parts I and J of SERENA-1 (NCT03616587), evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy for the combination of camizestrant and capivasertib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SERENA-1 is a phase I, open-label, multi-part trial of camizestrant alone and in combination with other anticancer agents in women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. In parts I and J, participants received oral camizestrant 75 mg (once daily) in combination with oral capivasertib 400 mg (4 days on, 3 days off). RESULTS: Participants (n = 29) had a median of two previous lines of therapy in the advanced setting; 55.2% had received fulvestrant and 89.7% had received a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor. Camizestrant in combination with capivasertib had a well-tolerated safety profile, with diarrhea (75.9%) and nausea (44.8%) being the most common adverse events. Median tmax was achieved ∼4 hours and ∼2 hours post dose for camizestrant and capivasertib, respectively. Clinical benefit at 24 weeks was seen in 51.7% of participants, and median progression-free survival was 8.3 months. CONCLUSION: In these pretreated participants, camizestrant 75 mg in combination with capivasertib 400 mg was well tolerated, with a side effect profile consistent with each drug as monotherapy, and showed encouraging evidence of clinical efficacy.</description>

DATA SOURCES: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published literature pertaining to patients diagnosed with isolated laryngeal sarcoidosis (LS). Demographics, symptomatology, diagnostic evaluation, management, and outcome details were recorded for patients diagnosed with isolated LS. RESULTS: 21 articles with 39 patients (11 male, 28 female, mean age: 33) were included (mean follow-up: 33 months). The most common presentations were dyspnea (74%), dysphonia (67%), and dysphagia (49%). The supraglottic region was most involved (n = 37, 95%). Systemic steroids were the most used initial treatment, leading to symptom resolution in 27% of patients treated as such. 64% of all patients underwent further treatment for refractory symptoms, most commonly surgical excision with intralesional steroid injection. All patients (n = 8) who underwent initial treatment with systemic steroids followed by surgical excision with intralesional steroid injection experienced complete symptom resolution. Emergent tracheostomy was required in 8 (21%) patients during treatment and maintenance therapy was required in 11 (28%) patients. Long-term outcomes (follow-up mean: 33 months; range: 2-192 months) showed 71% complete improvement, 19% partial symptom improvement, and 10% no improvement. CONCLUSION: Isolated LS most commonly affects middle-aged women. Patients primed with a course of systemic steroids before undergoing surgical excision with intralesional steroid injection demonstrated the best outcomes. We recommend long-term follow-up of these patients for surveillance of symptoms and extra-laryngeal sarcoidosis manifestations.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: U.S. Network in TriNetX. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX global EHR database, identifying patients diagnosed with Bell's palsy (ICD-10 code G51.0) from 2004 to 2024. Data collected included corticosteroid administration within 72 hours of diagnosis, antiviral use (valacyclovir or acyclovir), and the performance of imaging (computed tomography [CT]/magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the head or face) or Borrelia burgdorferi serologic testing. Outcomes were compared in cohorts before and after 2013, the year the AAO-HNS guidelines were published. RESULTS: Steroid administration within 72 hours of diagnosis increased significantly after guideline publication, from 4798 (20.4%) patients before 2013 to 78,096 (33.8%) patients after 2013 (P &lt; .001). However, the use of non-recommended practices also increased. Imaging use rose from 32.9% to 41.0% (P &lt; .001), and serologic testing for Borrelia increased from 1% to 5% (P &lt; .001). Antiviral use, considered optional by the guidelines, increased from 11.8% to 23.5% (P &lt; .001) over the same 72-hour time period. CONCLUSION: Following the publication of the AAO guidelines, early steroid use for Bell's palsy improved significantly. However, the concurrent rise in imaging and laboratory testing-practices explicitly discouraged by the guidelines-highlights ongoing gaps in adherence and suggests areas for further provider education and quality improvement.</description>

Chronic rhinosinusitis is a heterogeneous condition, characterized by various phenotypes that often coexist with comorbidities. While the standard treatment is commonly applied to chronic rhinosinusitis, a significant number of patients do not respond adequately to medical management and experience frequent relapses of nasal polyps. Current biologic therapies primarily target type 2 chronic rhinosinusitis; however, no specific treatments are available for non-type 2 or mixed forms. Tezepelumab, an anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody for severe asthma, emerges as a promising treatment for TSLP-driven diseases. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study involving 26 patients with severe asthma who also presented sinonasal symptoms. Clinical assessments included nasal endoscopy, nasal congestion scores, SNOT-22, visual analog scale, nasal airflow measurement, olfactory evaluation, and eosinophil count. All 26 patients completed at least 3 months of follow-up. RESULTS: We observed significant improvements in nasal endoscopy scores, nasal congestion scores, SNOT-22, visual analog scale, and olfactory function. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the potential of Tezepelumab as a versatile therapeutic option for both severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis, including phenotypes previously excluded from biologic treatments. However, larger, more homogeneous studies are needed to confirm these findings. We believe that our real-world data may have important implications for the management of chronic rhinosinusitis, regardless of the underlying inflammatory phenotype.</description>

METHODS: Adult patients referred to a university-affiliated dysphagia clinic underwent standardized FEES using water, cow's milk, and soy milk during single and consecutive swallows. Evaluations were performed jointly by a laryngologist and a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Outcome measures included the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) and the Yale Pharyngeal Residue Severity Rating Scale. Inter-rater reliability was assessed through blinded reassessment of 25% of examinations by an additional laryngologist and two SLPs. RESULTS: Most swallows across all liquids were classified as safe. Unsafe PAS scores occurred numerically more frequently with cow's milk (18.2-25.6%), than with water (6.9-11.6%) or soy milk (9.4-11.6%). For single swallows, a nominal overall difference across liquids was observed (Cochran's Q = 6.00, p = 0.050), and for consecutive swallows an overall difference was also detected (Cochran's Q = 8.00, p = 0.018). Pairwise comparisons were not statistically significant after correction for multiple testing. No statistically significant differences were identified between liquids for vallecular or pyriform sinus residue. Agreement in PAS scores across liquids ranged from low to moderate (κ = 0.291-0.609), and agreement for residue scores ranged from moderate to almost perfect (κ = 0.528-0.824). Inter-rater reliability was excellent (ICC = 0.93, 95% CI [0.90-0.95], p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory within-subject study, no statistically significant differences were observed in FEES penetration, aspiration, or pharyngeal residue scores when using water, cow's milk, or soy milk. These findings provide preliminary descriptive data regarding the behavior of a commonly consumed plant-based liquid during FEES and may inform future research on liquid properties in swallowing assessment.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective observational study analyzed the histopathological findings of postoperative specimens from patients with pHPT (single gland disease). The indication for surgery was based on increased plasma intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations and the presence of symptoms typical of pHPT. To quantify approximate oxyphil cell content (OCC), we determined the percentage of oxyphil cells observed in each specimen. To quantify the approximate lesion volume, we determined the diameters of the fresh specimen (length, width, and height). Multiplying the lesion volume by the approximated relative OCC yielded an estimate of absolute OCC. Approximated absolute and relative OCC were then compared with preoperative plasma iPTH and calcium concentrations. Associations between these parameters were calculated using logistic or linear regression analysis. RESULTS: We studied 76 patients with pHPT. Increasing approximate relative OCC predicted slightly lower calcium concentration (indirect non-linear association, adjusted estimate 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19-1.40, p = 0.044). However, only in large lesions (&gt; 1.5 cm3) was high approximate OCC (&gt; 10%) associated with lower iPTH levels (adjusted odds ratio for "volume by content" interaction 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.52, p = 0.018). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with approximated absolute OCC as the variable of interest. CONCLUSION: In patients with pHPT, a higher approximate OCC was associated with slightly lower calcium concentrations, possibly mediated by a counter regulatory effect on iPTH production, especially in large lesions.</description>

Here, we converted bictegravir (BIC), a potent daily oral antiretroviral drug, into monomeric and homodimeric ester prodrugs. The homodimeric prodrug nanosuspension, NMXBIC, shows sustained plasma BIC levels &gt; 16 times the protein-adjusted 95% inhibitory concentration (PA-IC95) for six months after a single injection in Sprague Dawley rats. The results paralleled a short PK tail with the potential for late dose forgiveness. The monomeric prodrug nanosuspension, NM2BIC, shows lower year-long plasma BIC concentrations above PA-IC95 after a single injection. After repeated injections, NMXBIC and NM2BIC are well tolerated in New Zealand White rabbits. NMXBIC's physicochemical properties and high BIC loading/unit mass of the prodrug contribute to its unique ULA PK profile. These results support its development as a ULA formulation for HIV-1 treatment and prevention.</description>

However, numerous patients develop resistance to NACT and thus fail to benefit from it. Therefore, identifying reliable biomarkers to predict patient responsiveness to NACT remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate that elevated expression of INCENP and CDCA8 contributes to poor NACT responsiveness across multiple cancers. Mechanistically, the 5'UTR (GGACT at position 113) of INCENP and the 3'UTR (GGACT at position 1041) of CDCA8 undergo m⁶A methylation and are recognized by YTHDF3, which facilitates their translation through interaction with eIF3A, ultimately driving poor response to NACT. Moreover, inhibition of INCENP and CDCA8 enhances NACT sensitivity by promoting multipolar spindle formation. Collectively, our findings establish that INCENP and CDCA8 serve as crucial biomarkers for predicting NACT responsiveness and as potential therapeutic targets for combination therapy with NACT to improve patient survival.</description>

New approaches to texture analysis continue to be developed. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics studies for identifying histological subtypes of lung cancer remain scarce. This study aimed to improve the efficiency of the computer-aided non-invasive diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by supplementing the statistical approaches to MRI image texture analysis with entropy-based methods. The study included 31 patients with NSCLC, categorized into two histological groups containing 12 patients (75 images) with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 19 patients (79 images) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A total of 154 MRI images were annotated using 154 regions of interest (ROIs). ROIs were extracted, filtered using normalize and median filtrations, and analyzed using standard statistical approaches and novel entropy-based methods. Texture features were selected using Select From Model (SFM) protocol and the classified using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression (LR), separately. After 5-fold stratified cross-validation, the LR algorithm achieved the highest classification performance (0.75 accuracy and 0.78 presision) on the combined statistical and entropy-based texture features extracted from MRI images after median filtration. The proposed protocol presented higher efficiency than protocols that worked only on the statistical texture features on unfiltered or normalize filtered MRI images; therefore, it may be suggested for further research on the computer-aided diagnosis of NSCLC histological subtypes.</description>

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 74 incident end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who commenced thrice-weekly HD at Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, between 2012 and 2018. A total of 83 candidate variables, including demographics, traditional indicators (Kt/V, phosphorus, parathyroid hormone [PTH], albumin, hemoglobin, ultrafiltration volume), and dialysis machine parameters, were evaluated. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression identified predictors of 1.5-year outcomes. RESULTS: The mean (± SD) age of the study population was 62 ± 14 years, and 55.4% were male. Independent predictors included serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measured at month 3 and machine-derived bicarbonate conductivity (BC) at month 6. A model combining ALP (month 3), bicarbonate conductivity (month 6), and traditional indicators (month 6) showed strong discrimination (AUC = 0.82). Achieving targets in ≥5 of 8 indicators-including ALP and BC-was associated with significantly better outcomes (log-rank p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: Integrating ALP and machine-derived BC into a Cox model significantly improves risk stratification in incident HD patients and facilitates the implementation of automated quality control.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To determine the 10-year appendicitis recurrence and appendectomy rate in patients with uncomplicated appendicitis treated with antibiotics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Ten-year observational follow-up of patients in the Appendicitis Acuta (APPAC) multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing appendectomy with antibiotics at 6 Finnish hospitals from November 2009 to June 2012, where 530 patients (aged 18-60 years) with uncomplicated acute appendicitis diagnosed by computed tomography were randomly assigned to appendectomy (n = 273) or antibiotics (n = 257). Last follow-up was April 29, 2024. This current analysis focused on assessing the 10-year appendicitis recurrence rate among patients assigned to antibiotics. INTERVENTIONS: Open appendectomy vs antibiotics with intravenous ertapenem sodium (1 g/d) for 3 days followed by 7 days of oral levofloxacin (500 mg once daily) and metronidazole (500 mg 3 times/d). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prespecified 10-year secondary end points included late (after 1 year) appendectomy and appendicitis recurrence rate after antibiotics and complications. Post hoc outcomes included the detection of possible appendiceal tumors among patients in the antibiotic group undergoing appendectomy or with an intact appendix using magnetic resonance imaging. Additional post hoc outcomes were quality of life and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: At 10-year follow-up, 253/257 patients (98.4%) randomized to receive antibiotics (median age, 33 years; 102 [40.3%] female) were assessed for appendicitis recurrence, with a true appendicitis recurrence rate (appendicitis at histopathology) of 37.8% (95% CI, 31.6%-44.1% [87/230]) and a cumulative appendectomy rate of 44.3% (95% CI, 38.2%-50.4% [112/253]). Overall, the 10-year cumulative complication rate in the group randomized to appendectomy was 27.4% (95% CI, 21.6%-33.3% [62/226]) and 8.5% (95% CI, 4.8%-12.1% [19/224]) in the group randomized to receive antibiotics (P &lt; .001). There was no observed significant difference in quality of life between antibiotics and appendectomy (387/530; median health index value, 1.0 [95% CI, 1.0-1.0] for both groups; P = .18). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients initially treated with antibiotics for uncomplicated acute appendicitis, the rate of recurrence and appendectomy at 10-year follow-up supports the use of antibiotics as an option for uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adult patients.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 46 adult COME patients from the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University who had failed a standardized 3-month non-surgical interventions and underwent one of three interventions: (1) TTI alone, (2) BDET + TTI, or (3) BDET alone. Preoperative evaluations included otoscopy, pure-tone audiometry (PTA), tympanometry, nasopharyngeal endoscopy, eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire (ETDQ-7), and temporal bone CT scans. Postoperative evaluation incorporated PTA, tympanometry, and ETDQ-7 assessment. Statistical analysis incorporated both within-group (pre-post) and between-group comparisons of therapeutic outcomes. RESULTS: All interventions demonstrated therapeutic safety with no postoperative complications. While all groups showed hearing improvement, the BDET group failed to achieve statistically significant improvement in air conduction (AC) thresholds. The BDET + TTI combination yielded superior outcomes to TTI alone in AC thresholds, air-bone gap (ABG), and ETDQ-7 scores improvements. Tympanometric normalization was significant in both TTI-containing groups but not in the BDET-alone group. CONCLUSIONS: While BDET monotherapy shows limited efficacy in adult COME management, its combination with TTI produces superior therapeutic outcomes compared to either procedure alone. These results position BDET as a potentially valuable adjunct to conventional TTI rather than an independent treatment modality for this patient population.</description>

Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring uses EEG signals to quantify anesthetic depth. We conducted a prospective study to examine changes in VOTE scores and pharyngeal opening pressure (PhOP) during DISE with positive airway pressure (DISE-PAP), at light and deep sedation. METHODS: Anesthetic depth was monitored using BIS during DISE-PAP for 17 patients. We classified BIS ≥ 55 as light sedation and &lt; 55 as deep sedation. The DISE exam was performed and subsequently PAP applied to assess PhOP at both light and deep sedation. We defined PhOP as the minimum pressure wherein all areas of the airway were opened. A blinded evaluation of the procedure video was performed by either one of two sleep surgery fellows or an attending sleep surgeon to create a VOTE score for the DISE exam and PhOP. RESULTS: All n = 17 patients enrolled had OSA with a mean AHI of 30.5 and standard deviation 17.8. PhOP significantly correlated with BIS readings (rho = -0.45, p = 0.0328) but VOTE classification did not significantly correlate with BIS level (rho = 0.18, p = 0.189). The velum and epiglottis had opening pressures that correlated to BIS level (rho = -0.398; p = 0.044) and (rho = -0.426; p = 0.038), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthetic depth measured by BIS correlates with airway resistance as measured by PhOP. PAP appears to be a useful tool during DISE as it gives a highly titratable and immediate measurement of pharyngeal collapsibility.</description>

METHODS: Medical records and video recordings of patients with vocal fold polyps or cysts who underwent OBLS between November 2023 and September 2025 were reviewed. Demographic data included age, gender, history of smoking, history of reflux disease, type of vocal fold pathology, and type of office-based laryngeal procedure. Prevalence, morphology, and disease regression of CRLs were assessed by two otolaryngologists who independently reviewed the video recordings of patients included in this study. RESULTS: Twenty-six males and 19 females were included in the study. The mean age was 48.9 ± 14.9 years. The prevalence of CRLs was 60%. Most of these lesions were fibrous. Eighteen lesions were treated with ILSI, and 8 lesions were treated with the blue laser and steroid injection. Five patients were lost to follow-up. Analysis of 21 CRLs showed complete disease regression in 52.4% of cases, and partial disease regression in 47.6% of cases. There was no statistically significant difference in disease regression between the two treatment subgroups (p = 0.284). There was a statistically significant difference in total disease regression of the primary lesion between those who had partial vs. complete disease regression of their CRL (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: CRLs are common in patients with vocal fold polyps and cysts. All lesions regressed partially or completely following OBLS using the blue laser and/or steroid injection.</description>

Prior work proposed copy number alteration-corrected TMB (ccTMB) and an esophageal cancer genome-based immuno-oncology classification (EGIC) scheme as pre-specified biomarkers to predict treatment efficacy. Here, we present the final analysis of the JUPITER-06 study and further explore potential biomarkers associated with OS. PATIENTS AND METHOD: 514 patients with treatment-naïve advanced ESCC were randomized 1:1 to receive toripalimab or placebo in combination with paclitaxel plus cisplatin every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles, followed by toripalimab or placebo maintenance. The co-primary endpoints were OS and PFS assessed by blinded intendent central review. Whole-exome sequencing of 486 tumors enabled biomarker analyses. RESULT: As of February 23, 2023, toripalimab plus TP significantly improved OS versus placebo plus TP (17.7 months [95% CI, 14.6-20.8] vs. 12.9 months [95% CI, 11.6-14.1]; HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.58-0.88]; P = 0.002). The 3-year OS rates were 29.7% and 19.9% in the two groups, respectively. Neither PD-L1 expression nor tumor mutation burden (TMB) significantly correlated with OS benefit. In contrast, pre-specified biomarkers, ccTMB and EGIC scheme, robustly stratified patients with different long-term OS benefits from immunochemotherapy. Further exploratory analysis discovered that loss-of-function alterations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex were associated with improved OS, whereas gain-of-function alterations in cell cycle and WNT signaling pathways correlated with reduced survival benefits. Importantly, CDK4/6 and PORCN inhibitors were identified as potential partners to overcome resistance and enhance efficacy of immunochemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This final OS analysis of JUPITER-06 confirms the sustained survival benefit of toripalimab plus chemotherapy in advanced ESCC. ccTMB and EGIC enable consistently precise patient stratification, while pathway-specific vulnerabilities highlight actionable targets for exploratory combination strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Busang J, Zuma T, Chimbindi N, Ngoma N, Herbst C, Okesola N, Dreyer J, Smit T, Bird K, Mtolo L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-24889-1'&gt;10.1186/s12889-025-24889-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41559582/'&gt;41559582&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Barriers and challenges associated with daily oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) contribute to poor uptake, low retention, and adherence rates among youth. Offering a choice of PrEP modalities integrated with peer support and delivered through community-based sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services will overcome these challenges. We describe the design of a trial to evaluate this approach at a population level. METHODS: We are conducting a type 1a hybrid effectiveness, phase 3B, cluster randomised controlled trial (LAPIS) to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of offering PrEP modality choices through community-based SRH services amongst youth aged 15-30 years living in rural Kwa-Zulu Natal, South Africa. LAPIS is nested within Thetha nami ngithethe nawe (Let's Talk), an ongoing stepped-wedge trial with two periods investigating the effectiveness, implementation, and cost effectiveness of peer-led social mobilisation into decentralised integrated HIV and SRH services on the population prevalence of sexually transmissible HIV amongst youth. In the second period of Thetha nami, 40 trial clusters were randomised 1:1 to receive either a choice of PrEP modalities (oral PrEP, long-acting PrEP, i.e., two-monthly injectable cabotegravir (CAB LA) or dapivirine vaginal ring and HIV post-exposure prophylaxis [PEP] packs) or enhanced standard of care (ESoC) with oral PrEP only. All trial clusters are supported by peer navigators offering peer support and visited monthly by a mobile nurse-led clinic offering adolescent and youth-friendly HIV and SRH services. There are two primary outcomes: (1) effective uptake of PrEP or PEP, and (2) retention on PrEP, defined as attending at least one follow-up appointment after PrEP/PEP initiation, which are based on clinic data. Implementation outcomes are assessed using a mixed-methods and process evaluation following the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. DISCUSSION: LAPIS is a pragmatic trial to evaluate the addition of long-acting PrEP modalities to daily oral PrEP within community-based SRH services. By offering PrEP choices, LAPIS adopts a person-centred approach to improve adherence and retention among youth, including hidden key populations. Findings will provide insights into the real-world implementation of CAB-LA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier-NCT06250504. Registered: 01 February 2024.</description>

A planned sensitivity analysis was conducted to evaluate whether sleep-related item content influences associations with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analytical study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Fifty adults with CRSsNP completed the NOSE-E, SNOT-22, and CRS-PRO questionnaires. Sociodemographic and clinical variables, including age, sex, BMI, smoking status, allergic rhinitis, asthma, OSA, and prior nasal surgery, were recorded. Univariate and multivariable linear regressions were used to identify independent predictors for each PROM. A predefined sleep-free analysis excluded sleep- and fatigue-related items (NOSE-E item 4; SNOT-22 items 11-14; CRS-PRO items 9-10). RESULTS: Each PROM demonstrated a distinct predictor profile. In multivariable models, age and smoking independently predicted NOSE-E scores. Previous nasal surgery was the only independent predictor of SNOT-22 scores. Age and OSA were associated with CRS-PRO scores in the primary model; however, the OSA association disappeared in the sleep-free analysis, indicating that it was driven by sleep-related item content rather than sinonasal symptomatology. All models showed modest explanatory capacity (adjusted R² ≈ 0.10-0.19). CONCLUSION: Systemic and lifestyle factors exert instrument-specific influences on symptom reporting in CRSsNP. The apparent association between OSA and CRS-PRO is mediated by sleep-related items, underscoring the importance of considering domain structure when selecting and interpreting PROMs. PROM-based evaluations in CRSsNP should incorporate domain-aware interpretation and caution in patients with sleep comorbidities.</description>

We aimed to test whether facial emotion analysis can quantitatively evaluate patients' emotional responses before and after each rehabilitation session and whether these changes relate to conventional subjective/physiological stress markers and discharge physical outcomes. We conducted a single-center prospective observational study of 32 patients who underwent radical gastrectomy or esophagectomy between August 2024 and February 2025. Immediately before and after each rehabilitation session, 30 s iPad video interviews (median, six per patient) were recorded and analyzed using MAL Face Emotion software to obtain normalized scores (0%-100%) for Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry, and Surprised emotions. Subjective stress (0-100 mm visual analog scale) and salivary α-amylase activity were collected concurrently; discharge physical function was assessed using the 6 min walk distance and Five Times Sit-to-Stand tests. Pre- and post-session values were compared using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and associations were examined with age-adjusted regression and Spearman correlation. Thirty-one patients completed the study without adverse events. After rehabilitation, the Happy score increased (median +3.5%, p = 0.013) and stress decreased (-1.5 mm, p = 0.025), whereas salivary α-amylase and other emotions were unchanged. Changes in the Happy score (p = 0.21) and stress (p = 0.19) did not predict discharge physical function, whereas changes in the Sad score correlated moderately with changes in salivary α-amylase (ρ = 0.45). The findings of this single-center study provide preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility of facial emotion analysis as a non-invasive, quantitative tool for real-time psychological monitoring during postoperative rehabilitation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate its potential to support a more personalized delivery of cancer rehabilitation.</description>

While stress physiology has been extensively studied in clinical populations, few studies have systematically examined the association between academic stress and multiple salivary biomarkers in undergraduates, particularly with attention to sex differences. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between self-reported academic stress survey measured via the SISCO inventory and four salivary biomarkers of cellular inflammation: cortisol, interleukin-1β, C-reactive protein, and immunoglobulin A in 81 undergraduates (53 females, 28 males). Biomarker levels were quantified using ELISA, and data were analyzed via multivariate approaches (ANOVA, Pearson correlations, and linear regression modeling). Participants were categorized as low (37%), moderate (35%), and high (28%) stress levels based on SISCO scores. Although no statistically significant associations were found between SISCO scores and individual biomarkers, multivariate analysis revealed a predictive model (R² = 0.14) combining all four biomarkers, with stress level predictions within ±20% of observed values. Males in the high-stress score showed lower cortisol trends but higher proinflammatory markers compared to females, suggesting divergent physiological stress responses by sex. These findings provide preliminary evidence for sex-differential association in self-reported academic stress with biological markers of inflammation, highlighting the potential of biomarker panels rather than single markers to capture the complexity of academic stress. In addition, this study establishes a methodological framework for combining psychometric tools with multi-biomarker analyses in stress research, addressing a critical gap in the literature on academic stress physiology.</description>

METHODS: Forty-eight adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 12 sham-operated rats (control group) and 36 operated rats (18 rats in the group with total thyroidectomy and 18 rats in the group with subtotal thyroidectomy). Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3) serum concentrations were measured prior to surgery and on postoperative days 14, 28 and 90; blood calcium (Ca), blood phosphorus (P), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations were measured on postoperative day 10; and thyroglobulin (Tg) concentrations were measured on postoperative day 60. The postoperative behavioral status of the rats was comprehensively evaluated on the basis of behavioral indicators. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in preoperative TSH, FT4, or FT3 between the control and surgical groups (p &gt; 0.05). On postoperative day 10, there were no significant differences in Ca, P, or PTH levels among the groups (p &gt; 0.05). On postoperative days 14, 28 and 90, the TSH level was greater, whereas the FT4 and FT3 levels were lower in the surgical group (p &lt; 0.05). On the 60th postoperative day, the Tg was significantly lower in the surgical group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Surgical removal of the thyroid gland can be used to successfully establish a hypothyroid rat model that is stable and reliable and can provide a model basis for hypothyroidism-related research.</description>

A dataset of 277 PNS CT cases from Korea University Guro Hospital, supplemented by temporal and geographic external test sets, was utilized. A 3D U-Net model was employed to segment maxillary sinus regions. YOLO v5 identified calcifications, followed by classification into three patterns: normal sinus or chronic sinusitis without calcifications, dense peripheral dystrophic calcification, and central punctate fungal calcification. A separate convolutional neural network (CNN) refined the classification to ensure accurate categorization of calcification patterns. The 3D U-Net model achieved a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.9674, indicating accurate segmentation. YOLO v5 demonstrated precision of 79.50% and recall of 92.14% in detecting calcifications. The CNN classification model attained F1 scores of 94.73%, 90.60%, and 94.01%, and overall accuracies of 97.48%, 86.87%, and 94.01% for internal, temporal, and geographic test sets, respectively. This study demonstrated the capability of deep learning algorithms to accurately detect and classify fungal sinusitis-related calcifications on PNS CT scans. The developed framework achieved high accuracy in segmentation of sinus area and detection/classification of intrasinus calcifications. The framework also demonstrated its potential for broader application to radiographic imaging.</description>

Fluconazole (FLZ) is the standard treatment but concerns about emerging resistance and drug interaction highlight the need for alternative therapies. Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG), known for its antifungal and biofilm-disrupting properties, has been proposed as a potential alternative. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and microbiome impact of a vaginal CHG formulation compared to oral FLZ in the treatment of RVVC caused by Candida albicans. METHODS: An open label randomized non-inferiority trial was conducted to compare vaginal CHG and FLZ treatments. Primary outcome was negative cultures for C. albicans. Resistance profiles and changes in the vaginal microbiome composition were also assessed. RESULTS: The study was terminated early due to local irritation associated with CHG and the study design was transitioned into a pilot study. CHG treatment showed comparable efficacy to FLZ in clearing C. albicans infections and preventing recurrences, although the sample size was limited. All 11 participants in the FLZ group cleared the infection after one week treatment, compared to 9 out 11 in the CHG group. No harmful changes to the vaginal microbiome were observed in the CGH or FLZ group. FLZ promoted a shift toward Lactobacillus crispatus dominance, unlike CHG. Notably, 16% of C. albicans isolates exhibited reduced susceptibility or resistance to FLZ. CONCLUSION: Due to the limited number of participants, we cannot conclusively determine whether CHG is non-inferior to FLZ in terms of efficacy for clearing acute C. albicans infections or preventing recurrences. While the current CHG formulation caused local irritation and is not suitable for clinical use, its antifungal and biofilm-inhibiting properties remain promising. Further development of less irritative CHG formulations may offer a valuable alternative for RVVC treatment, particularly in the context of rising FLZ resistance.</description>

However, data from Southeast Asian countries, including Thailand, are limited. Songkhla, a province in southern Thailand, has a predominant occupation and religion across different geographic areas which may influencing the incidence. This study aimed to assess the trends in skin cancer incidence in Songkhla according to age, calendar period, birth cohort, and geographical areas. METHODS: The study included patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin between 1989 and 2020, as recorded in the Songkhla population-based cancer registry. Geographic areas were classified into four categories with remaining groups: urban VS rural, Muslim VS Buddhist, fishing and farming VS other occupations, and rubber plantation VS other occupations. Age-standardized incidence rates (per 100,000 population) were calculated, and trend analyses were performed using Joinpoint regression and age-period-cohort analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of skin cancer in men declined after 2001 with annual percentage change rates of -2.24%, while it remained stable among women. However, when stratified by geographic area, the incidence among women showed a decline after 2016 in some areas. Overall, incidence rates were higher in urban than in rural areas, lower in predominantly Muslim than Buddhist areas, and lower in rubber plantation areas compared with other occupational areas. Age was positively associated with skin cancer incidence. The cohort effect demonstrated a decreasing rate ratio (RR) among men born after 1945, while no significant change in RR was observed among women. The period effect showed no significant influence on RR in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of skin cancer in Songkhla, Thailand, has shown a decreasing trend in men and remained stable in women, awareness and prevention should continue to be emphasized, particularly among older individuals who are more prone to UV radiation exposure.</description>

METHODS: A total of 60 systemically healthy, non-smoking individuals were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were divided into three groups based on periodontal examination: healthy (Group H, n = 20), gingivitis (Group G, n = 20), and periodontitis (Group P, n = 20). Clinical periodontal parameters were recorded. Salivary biomarker levels were analyzed using ELISA. RESULTS: All biomarkers were significantly elevated in groups G and P compared to group H (p &lt; 0.05), and higher in group P than group G (p &lt; 0.05). ROC analysis revealed that galectin-9 (AUC = 0.946) was significantly better at distinguishing periodontal disease than galectin-8 (AUC = 0.832) and RANKL (AUC = 0.780) (p &lt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed between galectin-8 and RANKL (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Salivary galectin-8, galectin-9, and RANKL levels are elevated in periodontal disease and may serve as diagnostic biomarkers. Among them, galectin-9 demonstrated superior discriminative power for identifying periodontal disease. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT06404476.</description>

Utilizing digital scanning and 3-dimensional printing, a direct-to-multiunit abutment dental prosthesis can be fabricated as a fully digital alternative to this analog method. Although direct-to-multiunit abutment connections have been reported in head and neck reconstruction using the IPS Preprosthetic System, their application in jaw in a day has not been previously described. This digital workflow eliminates restorative materials unsuitable for the operative environment, maintains sterility, simplifies intraoperative handling, and enhances mechanical integrity through minimized access openings. Moreover, it transfers prosthetic fabrication to the dental laboratory, allowing concurrent production during surgical reconstruction and enabling immediate intraoperative delivery.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Agarwal SS, Khandelwal E, Rao S, Xavier F, Galhotra V&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.018'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41580288/'&gt;41580288&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Surface electromyography provides an objective, noninvasive method for assessing masseter muscle function and postoperative recovery following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of mandibular condylar fractures. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare masseter muscle power and contractility following ORIF of unilateral mandibular condylar fractures using the transparotid (TP) and transmasseteric anterior parotid (TMAP) approaches. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study included adult subjects who underwent ORIF for unilateral condylar fractures using TP or TMAP approaches between January 2021 and December 2022. Subjects with pretraumatic temporomandibular joint disorders, additional surgical approaches, or incomplete surface electromyography data were excluded. Twenty-two subjects were analyzed (11 per group). PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was surgical approach (TP vs TMAP). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: The primary outcome variables were maximum amplitude and mean power. The amplitude is the maximum peak of the negative phase to the maximum peak of positive phase in electromyography. Power is defined as the sum of action potentials produced in the muscle. COVARIATES: The covariates were age, sex, and fracture patterns. ANALYSES: Longitudinal changes were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance. Operated and contralateral sides were compared using paired t-tests. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed time to ≥80% recovery (P &lt; .05). RESULTS: The mean age was 32.8 ± 11.2 years in the TP group and 27.8 ± 8.5 years in the TMAP group (P = .3), with male predominance (86.3%, n = 19). Repeated-measures analysis of variance demonstrated a significant effect of time on both amplitude and power within group (P &lt; .001), with no significant time × approach interaction. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that all subjects achieved ≥80% recovery by the earliest postoperative interval (7-10 days), with no difference between approaches (P = .4). At 3 months, a small but significant reduction in mean power persisted on the operated side in the TMAP group (P = .024). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Regardless of the approach used, the masseter muscle achieved ≥80% functional recovery within 7-10 days. Recovery is primarily time-dependent, allowing the choice of surgical approach to be guided by fracture characteristics and surgeon expertise.</description>

Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death, plays a crucial role in tumor progression, metabolic reprogramming, and immune modulation. Increasing evidence suggests that dysregulation of ferroptosis contributes to therapeutic resistance and immune escape in various cancers. MYO19, a mitochondrial trafficking protein, has recently been implicated in oxidative stress and metabolic control, but its role in ferroptosis and tumor immunity remains unclear. Meanwhile, microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized as key post-transcriptional regulators in cancer biology. Among them, hsa-miR-520a-3p has been reported to exhibit tumor-suppressive functions in several malignancies. However, the interplay between hsa-miR-520a-3p and MYO19, and their potential involvement in ferroptosis regulation and immune modulation in LUSC, has not been systematically investigated. METHODS: Data were collected from TCGA, UCSC XENA, ENCORI, HPA, and UALCAN public database. Differential expression, prognostic, correlation analyses and miRNA analyses were performed using bioinformatics tools including TIMER, TISIDB, Kaplan-Meier Plotter, and ENCORI. Ferroptosis-related analysis utilized Ze-Xian Liu's dataset. Functional assays, including CCK-8 viability, Transwell migration, and MDA/GSH measurements, were performed in NCI-H226 and NCI-H2170 cells after transfection with miR-520a-3p mimics/inhibitors or MYO19 knockdown/overexpression constructs. Ferroptosis sensitivity was further tested under RSL3 treatment, and ferroptosis protein markers as well as rescue experiments were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: The result revealed that MYO19 was significantly upregulated in multiple tumor types and correlated with unfavorable prognosis. Especially in LUSC, elevated MYO19 expression was associated with advanced stage, reduced immune infiltration, and enrichment of ferroptosis-resistant transcriptional programs, whereas hsa-miR-520a-3p showed opposite patterns. Overexpression of hsa-miR-520a-3p in NCI-H226 and NCI-H2170 cells increased lipid peroxidation (MDA increased), reduced intracellular GSH, and enhanced RSL3-induced cytotoxicity, indicative of ferroptosis activation. Conversely, MYO19 knockdown elevated ACSL4 and reduced SLC7A11, changes that were partially reversed by MYO19 re-expression. These findings suggest that the hsa-miR-520a-3p/MYO19 axis is associated with ferroptosis susceptibility and may influence the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.</description>

Postoperative enteral nutrition support can accelerate the postoperative recovery of patients with gastric cancer. We aimed to analyze the effectiveness of short-term oral nutritional supplements(ONS) in attenuating postoperative skeletal muscle mass loss in gastric cancer patients after hospital discharge and the impact on long-term prognosis. METHODS: This study included patients who underwent radical gastrectomy at our center between 2014 and 2019. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the effectiveness of short-term oral nutrition for reducing postoperative skeletal muscle mass loss in patients with gastric cancer. Using cox regression to analyze the effect of ONS and each covariate on overall survival (OS). RESULTS: ONS attenuated postoperative skeletal muscle loss, and it can improve the prognosis of patients, especially the elderly, those with poor nutritional status, anemia, and patients who have undergone total gastrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term oral nutrition is an independent protective factor for preventing skeletal muscle mass loss in patients with gastric cancer after surgery. Oral nutrition after surgery can reduce short-term muscle mass loss and is helpful in lowering the risk of death for patients.</description>

While generally considered indolent, limited case reports suggest their potential for regional metastasis. This retrospective study analyzed the clinical, demographic, and pathological features of 25 adult patients diagnosed with ganglioneuroma at Bursa Uludag University, Faculty of Medicine, between April 2007 and November 2023. The cohort comprised 18 females (72%) and seven males (28%), with a median age of 42 years (range: 19-79). Tumors were most commonly located in the abdomen (64%), followed by the thoracic (24%) and head and neck regions (12%), with the adrenal gland being the primary site in 32% of cases. Symptoms were present in 56% of patients, including pain, vision loss, hypertension, and palpable masses, while the remaining were asymptomatic. Surgical resection was performed in 92% of cases, with a median tumor size of 7.5 cm (1.5-18 cm). Median follow-up time was 88.3(16.2 - 217.8) months. Regional lymph node metastases were identified in 8% of patients, but no distant metastases or recurrences were observed during follow-up. These findings, including the novel observation of regional metastases, contribute valuable insights to the limited literature on ganglioneuromas. Despite its benign nature, this study highlights the potential for lymph node metastasis. However, the relationship between lymph node metastasis and recurrence has not been documented. In this context, further research is essential to better understand the risk factors, tumorigenesis, and the optimal management strategies for this rare tumor.</description>

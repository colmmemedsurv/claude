      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gazmenga FP, Windfuhr JP, Lau F, Toro MDC, Sakano E&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09985-7'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09985-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41699246/'&gt;41699246&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Extranasopharyngeal angiofibromas of the sinonasal tract (ENA-SNT) are exceptionally rare tumors that remain poorly characterized in the literature. We aim to systematically review and synthesize the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of ENA-SNT. METHODS: This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Articles that reported ENA-SNT cases in humans were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 145 studies were included, comprising 163 patients. The mean age was 28.8 years (range, 0-78), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The nasal septum (33.3%), inferior turbinate (16.6%), and maxillary sinus (16.0%) were the most frequent tumor sites. Common symptoms included nasal obstruction (73.0%) and epistaxis (68.1%), often in combination (55.2%). Angiography demonstrated no hypervascularity in 23.1% of cases; when present, the internal maxillary artery supplied the tumor in 96.1%. Preoperative biopsy caused brisk bleeding in 44.5%. Surgery was the primary treatment in 94.4% of cases, with a recurrence rate of 5.3% and an average time to recurrence of 3.8 months. Intracranial and orbital involvement were rare: 1.84% and 2.45%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This review supports ENA-SNT as a clinical entity distinct from juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Symptoms develop more rapidly, but the tumor is less aggressive, less vascularized, and has a better prognosis. ENA-SNT can occur across all age groups and in female individuals. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, with low recurrence rates.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wu S, Huang M, Guo W, Xie X, Su R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09973-x'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09973-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41699243/'&gt;41699243&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: This study aims to systematically analyze the impact of adenoid hypertrophy on dental, maxillofacial and airway structures and clarify its pathological mechanisms. Additionally, it seeks to develop a multi-indicator-based diagnostic model to provide a scientific basis for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 126 subjects were included and divided into three groups according to the A/N ratio (Group A/N ≤ 0.6, Physiological group 0.61 ≤ A/N ≤ 0.7, Pathological group A/N ≥ 0.71).The study compared the mandibular, two-dimensional airway and three-dimensional airway indicators among the three groups and combined stratified analysis with correlation analysis to identify the risk factors for adenoid hypertrophy. The effectiveness of the diagnostic model was verified using ROC curves, calibration curves and DCA decision curves. RESULTS: 1.There were no significant differences in gender distribution among the three groups (p = 0.404). However, the ANB angle (5.18 ± 2.06 vs.3.73 ± 3.09, p = 0.041) and Z-angle (63 ± 10 vs.57 ± 10, p = 0.014) were significantly higher in the pathological group. This suggests that adenoid hypertrophy may lead to mandibular retrognathia, which in turn may exacerbate Angle Class II malocclusion.2.Three-dimensional airway analysis revealed that the nasopharyngeal volume in the pathological group was 50% less than that in the control group (4,971 ± 1,803 mm3, p &lt; 0.001), confirming its mechanical compressive effect on the upper airway space.3.Age-stratified analysis indicated that in the control group, the U1-SN and U1-NA angles were significantly higher in the ≥ 11 -year- old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting physiological compensation. In the physiological group, the U1-SN angle was significantly higher in the 9-to-11-year-old subgroup than in other age groups (p = 0.036), but no difference was found in airway volume. In the pathological group, the Y-axis angle and MP-FH angle were significantly larger in the ≥ 11-year-old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), implying that early surgical intervention may be necessary for this subgroup.4.A/N was significantly correlated with mandibular, two-dimensional and three-dimensional airway indicators (p &lt; 0.05). Among these, PNS-UPW was identified as an independent risk factor (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74, p &lt; 0.001).5.The multi-indicator diagnostic model demonstrated an AUC of 0.950 (95% CI = 0.904-0.982).The calibration curve (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p &gt; 0.05) and DCA decision curve indicated that the model offered significantly higher net benefits than traditional strategies within the threshold probability range of 0.2-0.8. CONCLUSION: This study, leveraging multimodal data analysis, elucidates the pathological process by which adenoid hypertrophy affects dental and maxillofacial development via dual mechanisms of mechanical compression (airway narrowing) and functional compensation (mandibular retrognathia and abnormal tongue position).The developed diagnostic model serves as a quantification tool for the early identification of high-risk children, provides evidence-based support for determining the optimal timing of ENT surgery and designing orthodontic treatment plans, and is anticipated to enhance the precision and timeliness of children's maxillofacial health management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Whong Z, Malik A, Calder AN, Armstrong MF, Schuman TA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70444'&gt;10.1002/lary.70444&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41699192/'&gt;41699192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: To analyze the impact of COVID-19 infection on the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: TriNetX, a large international database of anonymized health records, was queried for adults with either positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2024. Patients with cancer or immunodeficiency before the COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable exposure and control groups. Relative risk ratios and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of CRS diagnosis were calculated 3 months after PCR testing. Sub-analyses were completed to investigate the effects of prior COVID-19 infection on subsequent CRS development stratified by prior vaccination status and by variant-dominant time periods (pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron). RESULTS: Propensity score-matched COVID-19+ and COVID-19- cohorts each consisted of 2,135,446 patients. Rate of diagnosis of CRS increased following a positive COVID-19 PCR test (RR = 2.13, 95% CI [2.10-2.16]) and varied across variant-dominant periods, with risk ratios of 1.44 (95% CI [1.41-1.47]) during pre-Delta, 1.20 (95% CI [1.15-1.25]) during Delta, and 2.10 (95% CI [2.07-2.13]) during Omicron. Prior COVID-19 vaccination did not modify the risk of CRS among patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR (RR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.92-1.05]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection was found to increase the risk of subsequent diagnosis of CRS. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between COVID-19 and the development of sinonasal inflammatory pathology.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Weir WH, Cloyd SD, Rickels KL, Farsi S, Davis KP, Hollowoa B, Gardner JR, Sloneker DR, King D, Vural EA, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70185'&gt;10.1002/hed.70185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41693606/'&gt;41693606&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Methods used in assessing decannulation timing after head and neck reconstruction vary widely. In this study, we examined the effect of implementation of a standardized post-operative tracheostomy decannulation protocol on our primary endpoint, return to the emergency room within 30 days for upper airway related issues, as well as on decannulation rates. We also examined the association between several patient/intervention characteristics and successful decannulation prior to discharge. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction requiring tracheostomy between September 2020 and October 2021 at a single tertiary center. A standardized protocol was implemented to determine candidacy for decannulation prior to discharge. Our protocol was two tiered with initial criteria including: tolerance of finger occlusion, passing of abbreviated fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), requiring suction no more frequently than every 4 h, adequate cough, no supplemental oxygen requirements, and alert mental status. Patients meeting these criteria progressed to a 24-h capping trial. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 114 patients who underwent the decannulation protocol, as well as a retrospective control cohort of 96 patients from prior to protocol implementation for a total of 230 patients. Although not significant (p = 0.34), a higher proportion of our protocol cohort, 45/114 (39.5%) of patients decannulated before discharge versus 31/96 (32.3%) of our control patients. For our primary endpoint, only a single patient in the protocol cohort had a return to the ED within 30 days for upper airway related issues compared with 6 patients in the control cohort (0.9% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.048), and we found no significant difference in readmission rates. We also found that across both cohorts, patients with an anterior defect involving the genial tubercle had lower rates of decannulation vs. other patients (24.3% vs. 42.1%; p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a standardized protocol for post-operative head and neck reconstruction patients can give providers greater confidence in discerning which patients are appropriate for decannulation prior to discharge and prevent returns to the emergency room.</description>

METHODS: Seven patients with ADLD underwent DBS (GPi = 4; VIM = 3) surgery. Postoperative voice testing was performed after stable DBS programming. Primary outcome measures included tremor rate, extent of fundamental frequency/intensity modulation, percentage of voicing, duration/number of voice breaks, and cepstral peak prominence. Linear mixed effects models tested voice improvement after GPi and VIM surgery, with significance determined after controlling for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: GPi-DBS showed trends for improved percentage of voicing, duration of voice breaks, number of voice breaks, and extent of intensity modulation pre-post within-group with large effect size. VIM-DBS showed trends for improved tremor rate within-group with large effect size. Between-group comparison showed greater improvement in percentage voicing and extent of intensity modulation in patients with GPi-DBS compared to VIM-DBS, whereas tremor rate showed greater improvement after VIM-DBS compared to GPi-DBS. Duration of voice breaks showed more improvement in GPi than VIM but it did not achieve statistical significance after multiple comparison adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Objective acoustic voice analyses provide preliminary, target-specific patterns that warrant confirmation of bilateral GPi-DBS for patients with ADLD and bilateral VIM-DBS for those with both ADLD and vocal tremor. Future research with larger sample sizes, along with investigations into the neuronal mechanisms underlying laryngeal neuromodulation, is needed to further evaluate the role of DBS in treating ADLD.</description>

Primarily, adherence to rest has been measured using patient reports, but their validity is unknown. Instrumental measures of rest adherence are uncommon. Furthermore, to our knowledge, subjectively and instrumentally measured voice rest has not been compared in voice patients. We aimed to compare patient-reported voice use (daily and overall schedules) to concurrent dosimeter readings in postsurgical patients prescribed complete or relative voice rest. METHOD: Sixteen women (M = 45.88 years, SD = 15.39, range: 21-69 years) and seven men (M = 46.43 years, SD = 13.43, range: 31-70 years) who underwent microflap phonosurgery for a primary benign vocal fold lesion were randomized to complete or relative rest, controlling for sex and lesion type. Postoperatively, they wore a VocaLog2 Vocal Activity Monitor for a 7-day voice rest period and used a visual analog scale to record daily and overall subjective adherence. Within-subjects (daily/overall report) and between-subjects (relative/complete rest) factors were compared using analysis of variance; dosimeter data were the outcome variable. RESULTS: For both groups, daily (F1,42 = 4.34, p = 0.04) and overall (F1,42 = 4.38, p = 0.04) subjective ratings significantly differed from dosimeter data. The least-squares-adjusted means indicated that both groups' subjective estimates were 79-83 standardized units lower than the instrumental data across both time points. CONCLUSION: Subjective patient reports of adherence should be carefully considered. The duration of voice use did not differ by the type of voice rest recommended.</description>

METHODS: A total of 107 patients (March 2023-March 2025) were assigned to a control group (n = 51, conventional antifungal therapy) or a study group (n = 57, hypericin + PDT). Post-treatment assessments included oral microbiota structure, α-diversity (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson), community differences (via PCoA and hierarchical clustering), and a mediation model to test C. albicans' role in lesion improvement. RESULTS: Chao1 (species richness) showed no significant difference, but the study group had lower Shannon/Simpson (microbial diversity). Opportunistic pathogens (e.g., C. albicans, Fusobacterium) decreased, while beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) increased. PCoA/clustering confirmed distinct community structures. C. albicans reduction mediated 53.1% of lesion size reduction (indirect effect = -2.656; 95% CI: 0.178-5.755). CONCLUSION: Hypericin + PDT effectively treats oral C. albicans infections safely. C. albicans is the core mediator for lesion area reduction, providing a basis for targeted clinical therapy.</description>

METHODS: An exhaustive literature search across international databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) was performed up to October 2025. Quality evaluation was conducted on the retrieved studies, literature management was performed using EndNote 21.3 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and meta-analyses were executed using RevMan 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK) and Stata 18.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Five studies were included in total, encompassing 465 participants. This meta-analysis of DIF positivity rates in tissues demonstrated significant differences with the following three antibodies between OLP and OLL: fibrin (Fib), IgA, IgM. The area under the curve (AUC) values of Fib and IgA indicated moderate diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analysis of five studies revealed that Fib, IgA, and IgM exhibited significantly higher positive rates in OLP than in OLL, indicating their promising potential for aiding the differential diagnosis of OLP. However, sole reliance on the positivity of a single antibody is insufficient for distinguishing OLP from OLL. Further research on the immunofluorescence patterns of these antibodies will help clarify the diagnostic criteria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This report was preregistered on PROSPERO with the registration ID CRD420251088424; the registration form is provided in Appendix 1.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Smith EE, Heintz JR, Chesnokova A, Taunk NK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.02.211'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.02.211&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41698471/'&gt;41698471&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Curative-intent pelvic radiation for cervical cancer causes premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) in premenopausal patients. Despite evidence-based recommendations for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat POI, prior studies have shown low HRT use among cervical cancer survivors, particularly those treated with radiation. This study evaluates the impact of practice quality improvement (PQI) initiative within a radiation oncology department on the rates of HRT prescriptions, POI documentation, and counseling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on premenopausal patients aged ≤50 years who received curative-intent radiation for cervical cancer at a single institution from 2018 - 2024. Rates of POI-related counseling and HRT prescriptions were evaluated before and after a PQI intervention targeting POI treatment. HRT prescriptions were stratified by physiologic sex steroid replacement regimens (PSSRR), defined as ≥0.1 mg/day transdermal or ≥2 mg oral 17β-estradiol, vs. other regimens, including oral contraceptives and non-replacement doses of physiologic sex steroid regimens. Binary outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Sixty patients met inclusion criteria. Patients seen after PQI intervention implementation had 2.1 times higher odds of receiving any HRT prescription, PSSRR or non-PSSRR, than patient seen before PQI intervention implementation (OR = 2.09, p = 0.015). PSSRR prescriptions increased from 3.4% pre-intervention to 57.7% post-intervention, with 80.7% of patients seen by an advanced practice provider (APP) receiving PSSRR. POI documentation increased from 48.3% to 80.8%, and inclusion on the problem list increased from 6.9% to 34.6%. High-quality POI counseling improved from 6.9% to 44.2%, and high-quality HRT counseling improved from 0.0% to 46.2%. CONCLUSION: The radiation oncology department-based PQI initiative significantly improved documentation, counseling, and PSSRR prescriptions for cervical cancer survivors.</description>

Although typically presenting in childhood, TGDCs can remain asymptomatic and manifest later in life. Proper diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary interventions and complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 26-year-old South Asian male who presented with a painless, fluctuant midline neck swelling that had progressively enlarged over the past few months. Clinical examination revealed a well-defined, mobile mass at the level of the hyoid bone that exhibited upward movement with tongue protrusion, a hallmark feature of TGDC. Ultrasound confirmed a cystic lesion, and fine-needle aspiration ruled out any malignant features. The patient underwent successful surgical excision via the Sistrunk procedure, which involves the removal of the cyst along with the central portion of the hyoid bone to minimize recurrence. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathology report revealed a unifocal tumor and after MDT's discussion total thyroidectomy was planned. Patient was asked to follow-up for radiation therapy afterwards. CONCLUSION: TGDCs can present at any age and should be considered in the evaluation of midline neck masses. A thorough clinical assessment, supported by imaging, is crucial for accurate diagnosis. The Sistrunk procedure remains the gold standard for treatment, significantly reducing the risk of recurrence. In cases with suspicious features or malignancy, total thyroidectomy may be necessary for complete disease management. Early identification and appropriate intervention improve patient outcomes.</description>

METHODS: Searches were performed in five electronic databases and gray literature. Studies involving patients undergoing any type of surgical excision of OL or PVL were included. Data extraction focused on surgical technique, margin size, method of margin delineation, and recurrence outcome. Margin size was categorized in centimeters. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included. More than half of the studies (54.9%) did not report the width of surgical margins. Among those that did, margins between &gt; 2 and &lt; 3 mm were the most frequently reported (19.7%). Notably, 94.5% of the studies did not specify the criteria used to determine the margin width. Furthermore, 76.9% failed to describe the method used to delineate lesion margins. High recurrence was observed in 15.1% of OL cases with surgical margins ≤ 2 mm and in 40% of PVL cases with margins &gt; 2 to ≤ 3 mm. Lesions with margins between 3 and 5 mm showed a lower recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: We identified a lack of standardization in the reporting of surgical margins. Excision with 5 mm of clinically healthy tissue should be considered the optimal approach for the surgical management.</description>

Matcha, a shade-grown green tea consumed as an ultra-fine powder, is rich in catechins that may inhibit the transport of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates such as nadolol. This study investigated the effects of administering single and multiple doses of matcha on the pharmacokinetics of nadolol in an in vivo animal model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32) were randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 (negative control) was administered normal saline followed by a single oral dose of nadolol (10 mg/kg). Group 2 (matcha single-dose) was administered a single dose of matcha (250 mg/kg) whisked in normal saline, followed by nadolol (10 mg/kg) after 30 min. Group 3 (positive control) received itraconazole (50 mg/kg), followed by nadolol (10 mg/kg) after 30 min. Group 4 (matcha multiple-dose) received matcha (250 mg/kg daily for 21 days) before administering nadolol (10 mg/kg) on day 21. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 24 h. Nadolol concentrations in plasma were measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using the PK solver add-in for Microsoft Excel. To ensure quality control, caffeine, a key marker compound of matcha green tea, was quantified using HPLC with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). A single oral dosage of matcha (250 mg/kg) had no statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of nadolol compared to the control group (p &gt; .05). Although the multiple-dose matcha group showed an increase in Cmax (~45%), AUC0-t (~18%), and AUC0-∞ (~22%) for nadolol compared to the control group, these differences were not statistically significant (p &gt; .05). In contrast, the t½ (h) of nadolol increased significantly from 4.0 ± 1.6 in the control group to 7.7 ± 4.2 (p = .039) in the matcha multiple-dose group. Itraconazole co-administration significantly increased systemic exposure (AUC) of nadolol (p = .009), confirming the validity of the animal model. Caffeine, a key marker compound in matcha tea, was quantified at 4.18 ± 0.44% w/w of dry matcha tea powder, equivalent to 41.8 ± 4.4 mg/g. This is the first study to explore the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between matcha tea and nadolol. Single and multiple oral doses of matcha green tea had negligible effects on most pharmacokinetic parameters of nadolol, except for an increased half-life in the multiple-dose group. Further research is needed to establish the clinical relevance of this interaction before definitive recommendations on the safety of matcha tea and nadolol coadministration can be made.</description>

DATA SOURCES: The authors conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases, reported using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included if they reported on rates of dental adherence among post-RT head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Data were extracted on rates of guideline adherence, dental health outcomes, barriers to care, and interventions. RESULTS: Twelve studies with a pooled sample size of 2925 patients met inclusion criteria. Adherence to post-RT dental guidelines ranged from 19% to 93%. Commonly reported barriers to adherence included lack of patient education, financial hardship, limited dental provider availability, access to health insurance, and poor care coordination. Facilitators of adherence included integrated survivorship clinics, pre-RT dental counseling, and structured follow-up programs. Interventions with multidisciplinary collaboration and streamlined referral processes showed promise in improving adherence rates. CONCLUSION: Adherence to dental guidelines post-RT is influenced by a combination of individual, provider, and systemic factors. While several interventions show potential, further research is needed to develop effective implementation strategies. Strengthening multidisciplinary communication, improving patient education, and implementing structured follow-up may enhance long-term oral health outcomes for HNC survivors.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the effects of hypoparathyroidism on salivary calcium levels, flow rate, and parotid gland structure, exploring the implications for oral health of this patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conducted as a case-control study between January and June 2024, our research included 86 participants: 43 with hypoparathyroidism and 43 in a healthy control group. We compared participants' salivary calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels alongside salivary gland ultrasonography features, sialometry results, and oral health questionnaire outcomes. RESULTS: Salivary calcium levels were significantly lower in the hypoPT group [5.43 (4.13-9.65) mg/dL] compared to the control group [7.06 (4.02-13.18) mg/dL] (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed in salivary phosphorus (p = 0.112) or magnesium (p = 0.938) levels. Despite similar parotid volumes, ultrasonography detected significantly higher prevalence of parenchymal heterogeneity in the hypoparathyroidism cohort (p = 0.025). Scores from the Multidisciplinary Salivary Gland Society questionnaire were significantly higher in the hypoparathyroidism group (p &lt; 0.05), while sialometry measurements were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results collectively suggested that hypoPT is a clinical condition with demonstrable effects on both oral health and salivary gland functions.</description>

Our prior work established OLP-associated fibroblasts (OLP/AFs) in creating the inflammatory milieu, but their interaction with MAIT cells remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate how OLP/AFs interact with MAIT cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral mucosal samples from OLP patients and healthy controls were selected for flow cytometry to detect MAIT cells. MR1 expression on fibroblasts was quantified via RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. For functional assays, OLP/AFs were stimulated with formaldehyde-fixed Escherichia coli (E. coli) to induce MR1 surface expression, then co-cultured with PBMCs±anti-MR1 blocking antibody and evaluated the activation status of MAIT. RESULTS: MR1 expression and MR1+ fibroblast density were significantly elevated in OLP lesions compared to healthy controls. OLP/AFs demonstrated higher baseline MR1 expression than normal fibroblasts, which was further enhanced following E. coli stimulation. Co-culture of E. coli-stimulated OLP/AFs with peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced marked activation of MAIT cells. This was evidenced by significantly increased frequencies of CD69+ MAIT cells and elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. CONCLUSION: OLP/AFs activate MAIT cells via an MR1-dependent mechanism.</description>

METHODS: Recent studies and reviews on AMPK signaling, salivary gland pathology, and tissue regeneration were collected from PubMed, Medline, and Scopus databases. The evidence was synthesized to elucidate the regulatory functions of AMPK in SG injury and recovery. RESULTS: SG homeostasis relies on a balance between cell death and renewal, which is disrupted by severe damage. AMPK functions as a pivotal regulator in this process, promoting acinar cell survival, activating resident stem cells, inhibiting fibrosis, and modulating immune responses. AMPK activation attenuates inflammation and fibrogenesis, enhances tissue regeneration, and fosters a reparative immune microenvironment conducive to glandular recovery. CONCLUSION: AMPK serves as a central hub linking metabolic regulation, immune modulation, and tissue repair in SG disorders. Understanding its molecular mechanisms and optimizing AMPK activation strategies may provide novel therapeutic approaches to restore both function and structure in damaged salivary glands.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 326 final-year dental students from universities in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. Participants completed a structured, anonymous 35-item online questionnaire addressing demographic data, exposure to oral biopsy procedures, self-perceived knowledge and skills, and attitudes towards biopsy practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon test, with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Most students reported having received formal theoretical training in oral biopsy (89.9%). Only 53.4% had performed at least one biopsy during their undergraduate studies, with excisional biopsies being the most common. Despite a high level of agreement regarding the relevance of oral biopsy to clinical practice (p &lt; 0.001), students demonstrated low self-confidence in performing incisional and excisional biopsies (p &lt; 0.001 for both), particularly in lesions suspected of malignancy (p &lt; 0.001). Prior practical experience was significantly associated with higher levels of confidence and more favorable attitudes towards performing biopsies (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Oral biopsy training among Latin American dental students is heterogeneous and largely theoretical, with limited practical experience contributing to reduced diagnostic autonomy and clinical confidence.</description>

Voice therapy plays a significant role in the conservative treatment of vocal cord polyps. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of postoperative voice therapy on outcomes in patients with vocal cord polyps. METHODS: According to PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search for RCTs of postoperative voice therapy for vocal cord polyps published before January 24, 2025, in nine databases. RESULTS: Nine RCTs involving 730 patients were included. Postoperative voice therapy significantly reduced VHI (MD = -9.66, 95%CI [-15.80, -3.53], P = 0.002). Additionally, it improved jitter (SMD = -1.16, 95% CI [-1.70, -0.63], P &lt; 0.0001), shimmer (SMD = -1.18, 95% CI [-1.74, -0.63], P &lt; 0.001), and DSI (SMD = 1.53, 95% CI [0.56, 2.49], P = 0.002), and prolonged MPT (SMD = 0.65, 95% CI [0.27, 1.03], P = 0.0008). However, considerable heterogeneity was observed across outcomes including VHI, jitter, shimmer, and DSI, and the overall sample size remains modest. CONCLUSION: Postoperative voice therapy demonstrates efficacy in mitigating VHI, jitter, shimmer, and DSI scores, as well as extending MPT in patients with vocal cord polyps. However, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to the significant heterogeneity among the included studies, potential biases, and limited sample sizes. Future high-quality RCTs with larger sample sizes, standardized therapy protocols, and longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm these.</description>

Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in induced sputum (IS) samples is the most promising test for improving microbiologic diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in young children. We describe the TBPed Brazil study, a multicenter, cross-sectional study in participants aged 6 months to 15 years. We designed a two-arm study: a hospital-based arm with patients hospitalized with LRTI and an outpatient-based arm with children and adolescents referred to TB-specialized clinics. The main aim in the hospital-based arm is to determine the prevalence of PTB. In the outpatient-based arm, the main objective is to determine the accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra in IS samples compared to liquid culture. We evaluate in both arms: tuberculosis infection (TBI) prevalence, the accuracy of tongue swabs compared to liquid culture and clinical diagnosis, the risk factors associated with PTB or TBI; the accuracy of the Brazilian Ministry of Health scoring system for the diagnosis of PTB. In the hospital-based arm, we also evaluate the prevalence of viral and/or bacterial pathogens associated with LRTI. The sample size is 1,848 participants (1,118 hospitalized and 730 outpatients). Enrollment began in December 2021 and is expected to conclude in 2026, involving 27 study sites across Brazil. This is the first prospective nationwide investigation into the prevalence of PTB and TBI, as well as diagnostic accuracy across different methods, in children and adolescents in a large country with a significant TB burden. Study results will provide critical data on epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic approaches to MTB and other respiratory pathogens in children in Brazil, guiding future studies and public health policies.</description>

Nevertheless, approximately 20% of patients discontinue treatment within the first year. In Italy, data on DOAC discontinuation rates are limited, especially in high-risk populations. RITMUS-AF, a prospective, observational cohort study conducted in 31 centers across Italy, investigated rivaroxaban treatment discontinuation in patients with NVAF in routine clinical practice. It included 805 patients aged ≥18 years with NVAF who were newly initiated on rivaroxaban. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment during a 24-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints included the reasons for discontinuation and self-reported adherence to rivaroxaban therapy. At baseline, most patients were oral anticoagulant (OAC)-naïve (n = 599, 74.4%) and had either symptomatic (n = 364, 45.2%) or asymptomatic (n = 441, 54.8%) NVAF. The overall rate of rivaroxaban discontinuation was 8.9 per 100 patient-years (95% CI: 7.1-11.0). The main reasons for discontinuation were adverse events or physician decisions. After 24 months, high adherence was reported in 90.9% of OAC-non-naïve patients and 61.5% of OAC-naïve patients. Forty-six patients (5.7%) experienced bleeding events (with major bleeding events occurring in &lt;0.5% of cases), and one patient (0.1%) had an ischemic stroke. In the RITMUS-AF study, rivaroxaban treatment was associated with a low treatment discontinuation rate, along with high self-reported adherence and a relatively low incidence of ischemic stroke and bleeding events in a high-risk population, findings that may help inform clinical decision-making on the use of rivaroxaban in routine practice.</description>

Mucormycosis manifests in several clinical forms, including sino-orbital, rhinocerebral, sinopulmonary, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, musculoskeletal, osteoarticular, and disseminated mucormycosis, as well as single-organ disease. Although mucormycosis is often lethal, early intervention reduces mortality. Successful treatment depends on early detection and staging of the disease, timely initiation of antifungal therapy, surgical resection of infected tissue, reversal of immunodeficiencies, and correction of metabolic abnormalities. Liposomal amphotericin B is the preferred agent for initial antifungal therapy, with oral triazoles as alternative agents. Research on rapid molecular diagnostic strategies, new antifungal agents, host-directed immune augmentation, antivirulence immune therapeutics, and risk-based stratification to inform management of disease may substantially improve outcomes in patients with this highly destructive mycosis.</description>

This study evaluated the effect of a web-based educational intervention, grounded in the Health Belief Model (HBM), on caries-preventive oral health behaviors in pregnant women. METHODS: In a quasi-experimental design, 66 pregnant women in Bushehr, Iran, were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. The intervention group received a multimedia web-based education program based on HBM constructs, while the control group received routine care. Data on knowledge, HBM constructs, and preventive behaviors were collected before and three months after the intervention using validated questionnaires. Statistical analyses included repeated measures ANOVA to compare changes over time between groups. RESULTS: Post-intervention, the intervention group showed significant improvements in knowledge and most HBM constructs (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, barriers, and self-efficacy) compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05). Although preventive oral health behaviors increased significantly within the intervention group (p = 0.022), between-group differences in behavior change were not statistically significant (p = 0.171). CONCLUSION: The web-based educational program effectively enhanced pregnant women's knowledge and health beliefs regarding oral health but did not produce a statistically significant improvement in preventive behaviors compared to routine care. Integrating HBM-based web education offers a flexible, cost-effective approach to promote oral health awareness during pregnancy, though further strategies may be needed to translate knowledge gains into sustained behavioral change.</description>

Non-small cell lung cancer is the predominant subtype, constituting the majority of lung cancer cases. Therefore, exploring novel biomarkers is crucial for betterment of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. METHODS: The meta-analysis was performed using GEO datasets, to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMs) in the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases. We explored the ChEA database to extract the relevant transcription factors regulating the expression of our hub genes. Further, based on the highest degree of centrality, the feed-forward loop was identified with highest sub-network motif comprising of gene-TF-miRNA. We used pathway and GO term enrichment analysis to determine the importance of these DEGs in different biological processes. RESULTS: In NSCLC, we found 950 differentially expressed miRNAs and 1761 genes were recognized exhibiting the significant change in expression (p &lt; 0.05). Further, we investigated the role of sub-network motif in patient survival, hsa-miR-5010 was found to be significantly linked with patient outcome in Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) (p = 0.033) and Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) (p = 0.013) while SMAD4 (p &lt; 0.001) and NRG1 (p &lt; 0.001) expression exhibited prognostic significance in LUAD cohort only. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that NRG1-SMAD4-miR-5010-5p was the most prominent sub-network motif engaged in NSCLC patients based on the degree of centrality. In vitro mechanistic studies will provide better understanding on the role of NRG1-SMAD4-miR-5010-5p motif in NSCLC cases.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; D'Onofrio G, Herring AA, Hawk KF, Perrone J, Cowan E, McCormack RP, Dziura J, Matthews AG, Pantalon MV, Owens P, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.27019'&gt;10.1001/jama.2025.27019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41670966/'&gt;41670966&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Extended-release injectable buprenorphine may expand the reach of initiating medications for opioid use disorder in high-risk and hard-to-reach individuals who visit the emergency department (ED) and can be administered in low levels of withdrawal. OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of ED-initiated 7-day extended-release injectable buprenorphine vs sublingual buprenorphine on treatment engagement at 7 days. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter randomized clinical trial enrolling adult patients presenting to the ED with untreated opioid use disorder and a Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) score of 4 or higher across 29 EDs in the US from July 12, 2020, to August 21, 2024. Final follow-up was completed on October 24, 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive a 24-mg injection of extended-release buprenorphine (equivalent to 16 mg/d) or sublingual buprenorphine, which included either self-administration instructions if the COWS score was less than 8 or administration of 8 mg of sublingual buprenorphine in the ED if the COWS score was 8 or higher. All sublingual buprenorphine group patients received a 7-day prescription for 16 mg/d. Both groups were provided referral for ongoing medication with a scheduled appointment within 7 days. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Engagement in opioid use disorder treatment on day 7 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included engagement at 30 days, precipitated withdrawal and overdose events, craving scores, days of illicit opioid use, and patient satisfaction with treatment. RESULTS: Among 2000 patients randomized, 6 who were enrolled twice were excluded, resulting in 991 in the extended-release group and 1003 in the sublingual group. The median age was 37 (IQR, 30-47) years, 68% were male, 31% had an initial COWS score of 4 to 7, and 76% tested positive for fentanyl. The adjusted proportion of engagement in opioid use disorder treatment at 7 days was 40.5% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 38.5% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, 1.6%; 95% CI, -2.8% to 6.0%). Engagement at 30 days was similar, with adjusted proportions of 43.8% with extended-release buprenorphine vs 44.9% with sublingual buprenorphine (adjusted difference, -1.5%; 95% CI, -6.2% to 3.2%). Precipitated withdrawal was rare: 6 (0.6%) with extended-release buprenorphine and 8 (0.8%) with sublingual buprenorphine. Overdose events within 30 days occurred in 18 participants (2.3%) in each group. Patients receiving extended-release buprenorphine reported lower mean craving scores at 7 days vs those receiving sublingual buprenorphine (scale, 0-100; mean score, 26.5 vs 30.2, respectively; adjusted mean difference, -3.85; 95% CI, -7.08 to -0.63), fewer days of illicit opioid use in the past 7 days (adjusted ratio of means, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95), and better treatment satisfaction scores (scale, 1-5; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.25). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No difference was detected in opioid use disorder treatment engagement on day 7 between the 7-day extended-release and sublingual buprenorphine groups. Both buprenorphine formulations were well tolerated; precipitated withdrawal was rare despite a high prevalence of fentanyl.

METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, and Web of Science were searched from October 1st, 1990 to January 6th, 2025 for studies reporting bony union for maxilla or mandible reconstruction with vascularized free flap. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded 5985 abstracts and 52 were included in the review. Definitions of bony nonunion varied and were reported in 20 studies. Higher pooled rates of complete union were observed in reconstructions of the maxilla, reconstructions using the radius, and surgeries aided by virtual surgical planning. Treatment for nonunion was reported in 11 studies. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual surgical planning has the potential to improve union outcomes and reduce the need for revision surgeries in nonunion cases. The heterogeneity of the studies necessitates randomized controlled trials for further analysis of the nonunion risk factors and consequences.</description>

Here, we report the discovery of a series of ZIKV NS3 protease inhibitors identified through phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) using a ZIKV replicon-based cellular assay, and the subsequent selection of resistant mutants. These inhibitors, characterized by the presence of an N-acylsydnone imine group, bind to a previously undescribed allosteric pocket of the protease, locking the enzyme into a catalytically inactive conformation. We describe the characterization of IRBM-Z-1, our initial allosteric hit and IRBM-Z-2, a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infectivity and other orthoflavivirus proteases with a favourable in vitro and in vivo ADME profile, resulting in oral efficacy against ZIKV infection in mouse models, with potential as a prophylactic agent for human use.</description>

This study proposes a linearly coupled two-compartment PK model, where the coupling term is defined as a linear function of another drug's amount to strike a balance between model simplicity and physiological interpretability. The model introduces parameter heterogeneity and linear interaction terms based on the classical compartmental structure, more accurately capturing concentration-dependent dynamic changes during combined drug administration. To address the model's nonlinear characteristics and high-dimensional parameters, a hierarchical optimization numerical solution algorithm was developed, enhancing computational efficiency while validating robustness against Gaussian noise. Through systematic analysis of key PK metrics ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], AUC, and [Formula: see text]), the study reveals the mechanisms by which absorption and clearance parameter variations influence drug distribution in vivo. Combining numerical simulations, parameter ablation experiments, and real-world data validation, the full model (retaining all linear interaction terms) outperforms the simplified model in both goodness-of-fit and information criteria, demonstrating superior interpretability and predictive performance. Overall, this model offers an intermediate solution between traditional compartmental models and PBPK models, providing a novel methodological framework for quantitative research on drug-drug interactions.</description>

We developed a video-based, dynamic, artificial intelligence (AI) application, DynaFace, to objectively quantify facial metrics and determine which measures correspond with patient-reported appearance, function, and psychosocial outcomes, providing insight into how objective dynamics relate to subjective patient experience. METHODS: DynaFace automatically extracted dynamic facial metrics (facial asymmetry index [FAI], bilateral palpebral fissure, and oral commissure excursion [OCE]) at rest and during smile, laughter, and pucker. Multivariable linear regression, controlling for paralysis duration and baseline trait emotional intelligence, assessed associations between objective metrics and patient-reported outcomes from FACE-Q subsets. RESULTS: Greater asymmetry (higher FAI) during smile and laugh was associated with poorer perceived facial (β = smile: -2.82/laugh: -3.01, p &lt; 0.05), eye (β = -3.99/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05), and smile appearance (β = -4.40/-4.80, p &lt; 0.01), as well as lower overall facial function (β = -3.05/-3.60, p &lt; 0.05) and self-esteem (β = -2.93/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, greater ratio of OCE change (affected to unaffected hemiface) during smile predicted better perceived facial appearance (β = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01), smile appearance (β = 0.69, p &lt; 0.05), and higher self-esteem (β = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05). Greater ratio of OCE change during both smile and laugh predicted improved social function (β = 0.48/0.44, p &lt; 0.05). Palpebral fissure asymmetry was associated with only eye appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic AI-derived facial metrics from DynaFace align with patient perceptions, showing that greater symmetry in movement enhance satisfaction and function. These findings highlight the clinical potential of DynaFace to bridge objective and patient-reported measures in facial paralysis assessment.</description>

The present study was aimed to develop a Flow cytometry- based Florescence In situ hybridization (Flow-FISH) assay for simultaneous detection of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts at single-cell level. A set of 48 STAT3 multi locus probes and 18 HPV16 E6E7 probes were designed using Stellaris Probe Designer. Fluorescence microscopy using these probe sets generated discrete punctate signals for both individual and simultaneous hybridizations, enabling accurate transcript identification. Flow-cytometry analysis showed quantifiable STAT3 expression across CaCx cell lines, namely HeLa, SiHa and C33a. However, HPV16 E6E7 probes showed non-specific binding, which was addressed by redesigning the probes with increased stringency. The specificity of both probe sets was then evaluated through extensive sequence alignment against all known STAT3 transcript variants (n = 27) and 98 HPV16 isolates. The redesigned phase 2 HPV16 E6E7 probes were subsequently tested in cell lines, demonstrating robust detection in HPV16-positive SiHa and CaSki cells and complete absence of signal in HPV-negative controls (C33a, MSB1, SF21) or HPV18-positive HeLa cells. Dual-color flow cytometry enabled simultaneous quantification of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts in both cell lines and patient's exfoliated samples. Increased dual-positive fractions across LSIL, HSIL, and SCC samples were detected that corresponded with progressive viral oncogene activity and STAT3 co-activation. Overall, the optimized probe-based Flow-FISH assay provided a sensitive, specific, and high-throughput method for transcript-level diagnostics, with potential utility for stratifying cervical lesions.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 209 ESCC patients treated with nCRT. PV substructures (LSPV, LIPV, RSPV, RIPV) were contoured on radiotherapy planning scans, and dose-volume histogram parameters were extracted. AF events were ascertained through systematic cardiac monitoring. Multivariate competing risk regression was employed to assess associations between PV doses and AF, with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, surgical resection as a time-dependent covariate, and mortality as a competing risk. RESULTS: Among 209 patients (84.9% male; median age 66 years), the 2-year cumulative incidence of AF was 8.89%, with a median time to AF of 13 months. Among the 25 AF events, 15 (60%) occurred after esophagectomy, with a median time from surgery to AF of 2.1 months. On univariate analysis, age, hypertension, LIPV-∼Dmax∼, RSPV-∼Dmax∼, and coronary heart disease (CHD) were associated with AF. In the multivariable model, LIPV-∼Dmax remained an independent predictor (adjusted HR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.19-8.42, p = 0.021) after adjustment for age (HR = 3.66, p = 0.009), CHD (HR = 2.59, p = 0.019), and surgical resection. Patients with LIPV-∼Dmax∼ &gt;28.87 Gy had a significantly higher AF incidence (12.3%) than those below this threshold (p = 0.008). Moreover, AF was associated with inferior 2-year recurrence-free survival (36.9% vs. 78.6%, p = 0.0051) and inferior 2-year overall survival (58.3% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Maximum dose to the LIPV was independently associated with increased AF risk and worse survival outcomes in ESCC patients receiving nCRT. These results highlighted the potential value of LIPV-sparing radiotherapy techniques and enhanced AF surveillance in this population. External validation in larger prospective cohorts was needed before firm clinical guidelines can be established.</description>

PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to estimate the frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications and identify associated risk factors in external and internal maxillary sinus lift procedures. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Periodontology, Gulhane Faculty of Dentistry, University of Health Sciences. Adult patients requiring maxillary sinus floor elevation via internal or external approaches were included based on residual bone height and radiographic availability. Exclusion criteria comprised systemic conditions affecting bone healing, heavy smoking, a history of sinus surgery or radiotherapy, and incomplete clinical records. PREDICTOR/EXPOSURE/INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: The primary predictor variable was the sinus lift technique (internal vs external). Additional predictors included patient-related, sinus- and site-related, and procedure-related factors. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was the occurrence of surgery-related intraoperative or postoperative complications (yes/no). Secondary outcomes included the types and frequencies of complications according to surgical technique. COVARIATES: Not applicable. ANALYSES: Statistical analyses included χ2 tests, independent samples t tests, and binary logistic regression analyses to identify independent factors, with P &lt; .05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 144 subjects (mean age, 49.0 ± 10.9 years), of whom 56.9% (n = 82) were women. Internal sinus lift was performed in 60.4% (n = 87) and external sinus lift in 39.6% (n = 57), with no significant age difference between groups (P = .2). Most subjects were systemically healthy 70.1% (n = 101), not using regular medication 72.2% (n = 104), and nonsmokers 91.0% (n = 131). Implant placement was achieved in 61.4% (n = 35). Sinus septa were present in 11.8% (n = 17), sinus pathology in 14.6% (n = 21), and bruxism in 22.9% (n = 33). Internal sinus lift was associated with a significantly lower overall complication rate than the external approach (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within the limitations of this retrospective study, internal sinus lift procedures were associated with fewer complications than external approaches, highlighting the importance of careful preoperative evaluation and appropriate technique selection.</description>

Methods: We conducted a narrative review combining descriptive analyses of European Cancer Information System (ECIS) outputs with evidence from the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR) Working Group on NMSC and from national reports. A targeted PubMed search (2015-2025) assessed scientific usage of European registry data. Results: Nearly 200 PBCRs operate across about 40 European countries, with heterogeneous structures and timeliness. The ECIS estimated 101,500 incident cutaneous melanomas (CM) in the European Union in 2022. Long-term data from Nordic countries show a tenfold increase in CM incidence over the last six decades, with recent plateauing in younger cohorts. NMSC registration remains inconsistent: some countries record both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), others record cSCC only, and several omit NMSC entirely. Consequently, Europe-wide NMSC figures are not available from the ECIS. Global estimates exclude BCC and understate the true burden, which is likely between 1 and 1.6 million incident cases annually in Europe. The PubMed search identified 538 European registry-based publications on skin cancer (2015-2025). Conclusions: Melanoma registration in Europe is robust, but NMSC remains under-registered. Priorities include harmonized definitions and counting rules, better integration of outpatient and pathology data, streamlined EU-level reporting, digital/AI-enabled case ascertainment, and sentinel regions to generate reliable NMSC estimates.</description>

Effective treatments addressing these determinants are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether enhanced group prenatal care (eGPC) outperforms enhanced individual prenatal care (eIPC) for reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conduced in 10 Medicaid-serving clinics in California's San Joaquin Valley, enrolling English- or Spanish-speaking Medicaid-eligible pregnant individuals at less than 25 weeks' gestation, from November 2019 to January 2024, with 2 follow-up surveys through 12 weeks postpartum. Analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to December 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to eIPC or eGPC. eIPC enhancements included assessments tailored to individual psychosocial, clinical, oral health, and substance use needs. eGPC enhancements included childcare, perinatal mental health screening and referral, transportation stipends, free groceries, and information on community resources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was depression, operationalized as change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores from baseline to 3 months postpartum. Outcomes were assessed by masked assessors. RESULTS: Of 1663 individuals assessed, 678 were enrolled and randomized; 4 withdrew consent, yielding an analyzed sample of 674 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.0 [5.8] years), including 50 African American or Black participants (7.4%); 37 biracial, multiracial, or multiethnic participants (5.5%); 485 Latine participants (72.0%); 77 White participants (11.4%); and 24 participants who identified as another race or ethnicity (3.6%). After randomization, there were 294 participants in the eGPC group and 380 participants in the eIPC group. No difference in reductions in depressive symptom severity from baseline to 3 months postpartum by randomization group was observed (Cohen d for between-group change, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3; P = .45), adjusting for baseline depressive symptom severity, self-reported history of a mental health condition, language, and calendar time at enrollment. Instead, participants in both groups experienced small to moderate reductions in depression symptoms from baseline to 3 months postpartum (eGPC: mean [SD] difference, -2.2 [5.3]; Cohen d = -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.3; P &lt; .001; eIPC: mean [SD] difference, -1.6 [4.5]; Cohen d = -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of pregnant, low-income, primarily Latine individuals, statistically significant improvements were observed in depressive symptom severity from baseline to postpartum, regardless of prenatal care type. There was no evidence of a difference between enhanced prenatal care types for improving depressive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04154423.</description>

SLPI plays critical roles in tissue homeostasis and pathology. Through its anti-protease ability, SLPI safeguards tissues from excessive damage caused by proteolytic enzymes released during inflammation and contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby influencing the cellular and tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, SLPI expression is implicated in shaping the immune landscape that facilitates tumor progression, and in driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consequently, it is not surprising that SLPI plays a complex and context-dependent role across various malignancies. It is overexpressed in most cancers such as colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and breast carcinomas, and this overexpression often correlates with a more advanced and aggressive disease. Conversely, its levels are reduced in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where elevated expression may be associated with a more favorable prognosis. This diverse behavior underscores that SLPI function in cancer is tissue-specific and dependent on the functional or pathological state. In prostate cancer, SLPI expression exhibits a bimodal behavior: levels are reduced in the early stages of the disease compared to normal tissues but become significantly upregulated in more advanced and aggressive stages of disease, with significantly higher levels observed in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Elevated SLPI levels in prostate cancer correlate with a reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival. In this review, we outline the current evidence regarding the multifaceted functions of SLPI and its expanding role in cancer, focusing primarily on the recently described molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of SLPI in prostate carcinoma.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rotolo N, Cerretani G, Casagrande S, Nardecchia E, Asteggiano E, Colombo A, Filipponi L, Piacentino F, Ilaria S, Fontana F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18030486'&gt;10.3390/cancers18030486&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41681958/'&gt;41681958&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Mediastinal paragangliomas (MPs) are rare, highly vascular neuroendocrine tumors whose surgical resection is the gold standard but carries a high risk of perioperative complications due to the MPs' proximity to major cardiovascular structures with potential life-threatening hemorrhage. Due to their rarity, the literature consists primarily of case reports. Our systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence from the last two decades to propose a standardized, multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and surgical management of MPs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted from 2005 to 2025. Studies reporting on surgically resected adult mediastinal paragangliomas were included. Patient demographic data, diagnostic workup, surgical approaches, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Analysis of 79 patients from 75 papers revealed a median age of 50 years (female predominance of 62%). Most tumors were in the middle mediastinum (51.9%). Sternotomy was the most common surgical approach (44.3%), with cardiopulmonary bypass utilized in 27.8% of cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 28% of patients, with left vocal cord palsy (12.7%) being most frequent. The median follow-up was 12 months. All percentages refer to the number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical removal is the standard of care for curative treatment of MPs. However, surgical treatment requires meticulous planning within a multidisciplinary team to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. The choice of surgical approach-open, minimally invasive, or with circulatory support-depends on tumor site, size, and vascular involvement. This review consolidates existing evidence of MPs' surgical management, aiming to mitigate the significant risks associated with surgery. Lifelong follow-up is essential due to the potential for recurrence.</description>

These retroelements are normally silenced early in embryonic development through epigenetic mechanisms and reawakened during oncogenesis, leading to transcriptional dysregulation, genomic instability, and immune evasion. Methods: In the present study, we categorized LINE-1 transcripts across 121 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) by subfamily, length, orientation, chromosomal origin, and distribution. In addition, high-prevalence insertions were mapped to nearby genes to assess potential functional interactions. Results: LINE-1 transcript abundance and length in NSCLC were dominated by evolutionarily young subfamilies, particularly L1HS and L1PA2 through L1PA5. Chromosomal patterns were conserved across NSCLC subtypes, with modest enrichment of L1HS activity on Chromosome 4 and the X Chromosome. The lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSQCC) subtype exhibited the highest total levels of L1HS expression relative to other NSCLC subtypes. Race modestly influenced LINE-1 transcript abundance, with cell lines derived from self-identified African American individuals showing elevated overall LINE-1 and L1HS expression. Age showed a weak positive correlation with total LINE-1 abundance. Integrative analysis revealed recurrent hotspots at 22q12.1 and 20p11.21 that were transcriptionally active across subtypes and coincided with previously reported intact LINE-1 elements active in epithelial cancers. Recurrent insertions were located near cancer-associated genes, including RB1, NEDD4, FTO, LAMA2, NOD1, and KCNB2, implicating LINE-1 activity in cis-regulatory remodeling of oncogenic pathways. Conclusions: Together, these findings indicate that LINE-1 transcript heterogeneity in NSCLC is shaped by host genomic architecture and conserved functional hotspots, providing new insights into the mechanisms of genetic and epigenetic dysregulation associated with LINE-1 retroelements.</description>

The most common genetic imbalance includes the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) locus. METHODS: We planned a bi-centric phase Ib dose-escalation study with the chemotherapy-free combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax and CD20 antibody obinutuzumab for rrPCNSL patients in Germany. The intended treatment consisted of 6 cycles of fixed-dose obinutuzumab at 1000 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, and an oral daily dose of 600, 800, or 1000 mg venetoclax, depending on the planned dosing group, followed by a 12-month venetoclax maintenance period. The primary endpoint was the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: This study was prematurely terminated after registration of 5/15 (33%) patients in dosing group 1 (600 mg oral daily dose of venetoclax) between May 2020 and November 2021. The mean ratio of the concentration of venetoclax in CSF over peripheral blood was 0.55% (±0.28 standard deviation (SD)) and 0.25% (±0.23 SD) for obinutuzumab. Two of five patients achieved complete remission, and each one patient achieved partial remission and stable disease as best response. The median duration of response was 6.5 months (range 0.7-47). CONCLUSIONS: Venetoclax and obinutuzumab can penetrate into the central nervous system, but the CSF concentration did not correlate with the outcome. The combination is feasible, tolerable, and may lead to durable responses in selected rrPCNSL patients.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the dermoscopic features of histologically confirmed subungual squamous cell carcinoma and to compare patterns between invasive and in situ disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023470387) following PRISMA and MOOSE guidance. PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. Extracted data included study design, lesion counts, histologic subtype and specific dermoscopic signs. Random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird with Freeman-Tukey transformation) produced pooled prevalences with 95% confidence intervals. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q and I2. We used subgroup and meta-regression analyses to explore the influence of histologic subtype, sample size and publication year. When the data allowed, diagnostic odds ratios were calculated versus common benign mimickers. RESULTS: Twenty studies comprising 121 lesions (96 invasive, 25 in situ) were included. In invasive lesions, the most common dermoscopic findings were subungual hyperkeratosis (pooled prevalence 89%; 95% CI 78-97; I2 = 0%), onycholysis (85%; 75-93; I2 = 28%), irregular borders (72%; 50-90; I2 = 42%), and splinter hemorrhages (52%; 40-65; I2 = 36%). In situ lesions more often presented with melanonychia (89%) and showed lower rates of hyperkeratosis (50%). Meta-regression identified histologic subtype as a significant predictor of feature prevalence (p &lt; 0.01). Key comparative performance estimates included a diagnostic odds ratio of 12.6 (95% CI 8.3-19.1) for polymorphous vessels distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from warts and 6.8 (95% CI 3.2-14.5) for hyperkeratosis versus onychomycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Dermoscopy reliably identifies features, particularly hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, irregular margins and hemorrhagic spots, that are common in invasive subungual squamous cell carcinoma; in situ disease more commonly presents with pigmentary changes. Recognition of these signs should lower the threshold for biopsy of suspicious single-digit nail lesions and may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective collection of clinical data for 36 patients with gynecological malignancies who underwent radiotherapy at our hospital from January 2004 to December 2021. RESULTS: The first primary cancer was predominantly cervical cancer (31 cases, 86.1%), with endometrial cancer accounting for 5 cases. Radiotherapy-related variables included the median radiotherapy duration of 42.5 days, external irradiation dose of 49.375 Gy, and total dose of 69.5 Gy; FIGO stages I/II/III were 7/18/11; lymph node metastasis in 6 cases; HPV positive in 20 cases; surgical history in 18 cases and chemotherapy history in 30 cases. The SPC cohort had a median onset age of 58 years and a median interval of 8 years after radiotherapy, with primary sites mostly in the rectum/colon and uterus; 24 cases occurred outside the radiotherapy field. Surgical, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy histories all influenced the timing and site of SPC. The median onset age after radiotherapy and interval to SPC were significantly longer in the cervical cancer group than in the endometrial cancer group (P = 0.01), and most SPC occurred within 5-10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The pathological features and treatment history of the initial cancer were associated with the timing and location of SPC. Analyses of post-radiotherapy SPC characteristics provide a scientific basis for optimizing clinical management and reducing SPC risk.</description>

Validated diagnostic biomarkers remain lacking, though circulating exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) have recently emerged as promising liquid biopsy tools across various cancers. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify a panel of dysregulated plasma-derived extracellular vesicle (EV)-associated miRNAs, hereafter referred to as exosomal micro-RNAs, as liquid biopsy markers for the detection of vulvar cancer and for assessment of HPV-positivity. Methods: Five healthy donor (HD) and 10 vulvar cancer samples underwent Next-Generation Sequencing to screen for differentially expressed exomiRs. The seven most dysregulated and four stably expressed exomiRs were subsequently analyzed in 81 cancer and 60 HD samples by qRT-PCR. Differential expression was determined by the 2-ΔΔCT method. Binary regression was used to construct an exomiR panel. HPV status was assessed using mass spectrometry. Results: Five single exomiRs showed a statistically significant dysregulation in cancer patients compared to healthy controls: miR-143-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-451a, miR-4516 and miR-151a-5p. The combination of six exomiRs resulted in a panel with superior diagnostic ability (p &lt; 0.001; ROC-AUC = 0.805; 95% CI: 0.726-0.884) in distinguishing cancer patients from HDs. A model consisting of miR-223-3p, miR-143-3p and miR-451a could discriminate HPV-positive from -negative (p = 0.003; ROC-AUC = 0.939), and a model of miR-4516, miR-143-3p, miR-16-5p and miR-451a was predictive of lymph node positivity (p &lt; 0.001, ROC-AUC = 0.786). Multivariate Cox regression showed that a model of downregulated miR-16-5p and upregulated miR-451a was significantly associated with poorer survival (p = 0.023). Conclusions: This study indicates the future potential of exomiRs as diagnostic and prognostic liquid biopsy markers for vulvar cancer.</description>

This systematic review aimed to describe the clinical patterns, temporal relationships, and prognostic implications of cutaneous metastases across major bone sarcoma histologies. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify all reported cases of cutaneous metastases from osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and chordoma. Data on patient demographics, primary tumor site, cutaneous lesion characteristics, latency periods, synchronous metastases, morphology, and clinical outcome were extracted and analyzed descriptively. Results: 102 cases were identified, with chordoma representing the most frequent histology. Cutaneous metastases showed histology-specific patterns: osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma typically presented with multiple lesions in the context of widespread systemic disease and poor prognosis, whereas chordoma more often exhibited solitary or skin-dominant metastases with longer latency and occasional favorable outcomes, including complete responses after local treatment. Conclusions: Cutaneous metastases in bone sarcomas display heterogeneous behavior, with chordoma demonstrating a more indolent and potentially manageable pattern compared to other histologies. Increased clinical awareness is essential to avoid diagnostic delays and optimize management.</description>

While NMSCs are more common, melanoma remains the most challenging because of its higher aggressiveness. Although the use of sunscreens is key in high-risk populations, it provides limited protection, which highlights the need for alternative solutions. In this review, we discuss current evidence on chemopreventive therapies, as well as their efficacy and adverse events, including immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients. Acitretin, nicotinamide, 5-fluorouracil, and photodynamic therapy have shown overall promising results in actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma. Nevertheless, more research is needed to establish their efficacy, particularly in melanoma, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cutaneous lymphoma, due to their higher mortality rates.</description>

However, the mechanism of its genomic integration remains incompletely understood. This study investigated frequent viral integration at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARA) gene locus-a known regulator of autophagy-and its potential role in HPV11-mediated pathogenesis. METHODS: High-throughput sequencing of HPV-positive specimens identified PPARA as a common integration site. HPV11 E6/E7 overexpression, PPARA overexpression, and PPARA knockdown models were established in human nasal epithelial cells (HNEpC). Cell proliferation, migration, and autophagy levels were assessed. The role of PPARA in proliferation and autophagy modulation was further validated using a nude mouse xenograft model. Additionally, the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) was applied to evaluate its effects on proliferation and migration. RESULTS: HPV11 E6/E7 overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation and migration. In contrast, PPARA overexpression promoted autophagy and suppressed proliferation and migration. Inhibition of autophagy by 3-MA reversed the suppressive effects mediated by PPARA. In vivo experiments confirmed the proliferative role of HPV11 E6/E7 and the autophagy-modulating function of PPARA. DISCUSSION: HPV11 exerts dual effects on nasal mucosal cells: promoting proliferation and migration via E6/E7, while concurrently inducing an inhibitory effect through PPARA-mediated autophagy activation. The suppression of autophagy reversed the PPARA-driven inhibition, indicating a key role for the autophagy pathway. These findings suggest that PPARA targeting may be crucial in the pathogenesis of NIP, highlighting a complex interaction between HPV11 integration and host autophagy regulation.</description>

Small-molecule fibroblast activation protein inhibitors (FAPI) enable high-contrast imaging of cancer-associated fibroblasts within the tumor stroma, offering rapid clearance and favorable biodistribution. This review synthesizes clinical and preclinical evidence comparing FAPI PET/CT with18F-FDG PET/CT across solid tumors. Head-to-head analyses indicate superior or complementary lesion conspicuity for FAPI in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer (CRC) -especially peritoneal and nodal disease-and context-dependent comparability in breast and head-and-neck cancers. Across studies, FAPI demonstrates higher tumor-to-background ratios and improved detection of small or low-FDG-avid lesions, with variable downstream effects on staging and management. We delineate disease-specific scenarios in which multi-tracer strategies may optimize diagnostic yield and propose a framework for integrating FAPI into precision imaging pathways. Priority areas include prospective, adequately powered trials; harmonized acquisition and quantification protocols; and evaluations of cost-effectiveness and theranostic implications.</description>

Botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) has demonstrated analgesic and muscle-relaxant properties in various medical applications, but its role in acute postoperative pain control in orthognathic procedures remains unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether preoperative BoNT-A injections into the temporalis and masseter muscles reduce postoperative pain intensity and muscle spasms in patients undergoing bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) for mandibular advancements. STUDY DESIGN AND SAMPLE: This study was a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted at Kingsway Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (Edmonton, Canada). The sample was composed of adult subjects presenting for the evaluation and management of mandibular advancement via BSSO between 2021 and 2024. Subjects were excluded if they had prior orthognathic surgery, chronic pain disorders, neuromuscular disease, pregnancy, prior exposure to BoNT-A, or required concomitant orthognathic procedures. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was preoperative intramuscular injection of BoNT-A, and subjects were randomized to receive either BoNT-A or saline placebo. OUTCOME VARIABLES: The primary outcome was postoperative pain intensity measured on a numerical rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst imaginable pain) over 14 days. Secondary outcomes included frequency of self-reported muscle spasms, postoperative opioid and nonopioid analgesic consumption, and patient satisfaction. Preanalgesic pain scores were recorded immediately prior to taking any analgesic medication, and postanalgesic pain scores were recorded 1 hour after as needed (PRN) analgesic administration. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, and operative duration. ANALYSES: Between-group comparisons were performed using independent t tests. Daily pain and medication-use trajectories across 14 postoperative days were evaluated using a linear mixed-effects model with fixed effects for group and time. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Forty subjects met inclusion criteria (mean age 26.7 years; 55% female). Preanalgesic pain scores were lower in the BoNT-A group (1.72 [SD 0.9]) than in the saline group (2.81 [SD 1.1]; P &lt; .05). Postanalgesic pain did not differ significantly between groups. Opioid consumption over 14 days was significantly lower with BoNT-A (4.9 vs 8.9 doses; P = .046). Mixed-effects modeling demonstrated lower pain and opioid use in the BoNT-A group. No significant differences were observed in nonopioid use or muscle spasm frequency. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Preoperative BoNT-A was associated with reduced preanalgesic pain and lower postoperative opioid use following mandibular advancement via BSSO. Although temporal trends favored BoNT-A, differences in daily trajectories of pain, muscle spasms, and nonopioid use were not statistically significant. These findings provide preliminary support for BoNT-A as a potential adjunct in postoperative pain management, warranting further evaluation in larger, adequately powered trials.</description>

The aim of our study was to develop an autophagy-related prognostic model for ESCC. METHODS: Using transcriptomic data of ESCC from GEO/TCGA and autophagy-related genes (ARGs) from five autophagy-specific datasets, we identified the intersection between ARGs and tumor-normal differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We constructed a prognostic model using stepwise multivariate Cox regression based on these genes in GSE53625 (n = 179), validated in TCGA-ESCC (n = 94) through survival analysis and ROC curve, and analyzed the prognostic value of candidate genes in in-house ESCC samples. RESULTS: We successfully established a robust prognostic 4-ARGs model comprising NBEA, CLOCK, NLRX1, and MAGEA3 (training: p &lt; 0.0001, validation: p = 0.013). In the in-house ESCC cohort (n = 14), NLRX1 was verified as a reliable prognostic factor for disease-free survival (p = 0.043). Significant correlations were observed between signatures and the immune microenvironment, and the model effectively predicted patients' responses to immunotherapy. CONCLUSION: We developed a novel 4-ARGs prognostic model and identified NLRX1 as a potential autophagy-dependent biomarker. These findings underscore its utility as a valuable tool for prognosis, risk stratification, and therapy guidance in ESCC.</description>

This paper introduces WLAU-Net, a novel architecture integrating three key innovations for contrast agent free segmentation. First, our transfer learning framework pre-trains the encoder on venous phase CT images to capture discriminative tumor features, then transfers and freezes these learned weights when processing non-contrast phase data, effectively preventing domain shift. Second, we implement a wavelet transformation module using sym4 wavelet decomposition to split images into four frequency subbands (LL, LH, HL, HH). By selectively amplifying horizontal (HL) and vertical (LH) edge coefficients during reconstruction, we enhance tumor boundary delineation while preserving anatomical context. Third, a local attention mechanism with Gaussian-based adaptive weighting dynamically prioritizes low-intensity tumor regions over high-intensity areas, sharpening focus on subtle boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate WLAU-Net's superiority with a 65.37% Dice score and 96.23% ACC, outperforming state-of-the-art methods including CS-UNet (64.50% Dice, 93.85% ACC) and Swin-UNet (62.34% Dice, 91.15% ACC). Ablation studies reveal critical contributions from each component: enabling all modules (transfer learning, Gaussian attention, and wavelet enhancement) achieves optimal performance, while removing the wavelet module reduces Dice by 1.16% (64.21%) and disabling both Gaussian and wavelet modules decreases ACC by 3.0% (93.24%). Compared to contrast-enhanced methods (92.1% ACC), our approach maintains competitive diagnostic accuracy (96.23% ACC) while eliminating allergic risks, offering a clinically viable alternative for contrast agent sensitive patients.</description>

However, the prognosis of patients is poor, there is an urgent need to explore more effective combined treatment strategies to improve survival outcomes. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined treatment with chemoimmunotherapy or chemotherapy and radiotherapy. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched using a combination of subject terms and free words. Data were extracted from studies that met the inclusion criteria and meta-analyzed using Stata 17.0 software to compare the efficacy and treatment-related adverse toxicities of chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy plus radiotherapy with chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy alone. RESULTS: Finally, a total of 12 studies (11 retrospective cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial) involving 2,428 patients were included in the analysis, with squamous cell carcinoma accounting for 98.9%. In terms of efficacy, meta-analysis revealed the radiotherapy combined group (RT group) had significantly higher objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) than those of the non-radiotherapy combined group (NRT group). Stratified analysis showed that for patients with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)-based systemic treatment and oligometastatic esophageal cancer, the OS and PFS of the RT group were significantly better than those of the NRT group (ICIs ± radiotherapy: Hazard ratio (HR)=0.61, 95%CI:0.48-0.76, P&lt;0.001; HR = 0.60, 95%CI:0.49-0.73, P&lt;0.001, oligometastatic esophageal cancer: HR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64-0.84, P&lt;0.001; HR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.58-0.76, p&lt;0.001). The incidence of grade≥3 hematological toxicity and treatment-related pneumonia in the RT group was higher than that in the NRT group, and there was no significant difference in gastrointestinal adverse reactions between the two groups(2.5%-12.2% vs. 3.4%-13.2%, P = 0.828). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data, systemic therapy combined with local radiotherapy may be a better option for advanced esophageal cancer, but the potential risk of higher hematological toxicity and treatment-related pneumonia need to be weighed.

This study aimed to compare serum lipid parameters between NSCLC patients and healthy controls and to explore their association with histological subtype and selected driver mutations. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides (TG) in patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma from 2021 to 2024, alongside a control group of 100 healthy individuals. Statistical comparisons were performed using appropriate parametric or nonparametric tests after normality assessment (Shapiro-Wilk), and p-values were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR). RESULTS: A total of 160 NSCLC patients were included. Most were male (75.5%) and current or former smokers (96.1%), with a mean age of 70.4 ± 10.3 years. Squamous cell carcinoma was the predominant subtype (64.4%). Hypocholesterolemia was observed in 59.9% of patients, while hypercholesterolemia was less frequent (40.1%). Compared with controls, patients had significantly lower HDL levels (p = 0.007, FDR-adjusted p = 0.024), while other lipid markers showed no statistically significant differences after correction for multiple testing. Differences between adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma were not statistically significant. Squamous cell carcinoma patients had higher TG but lower TC, LDL, and HDL levels compared with adenocarcinoma. A negative correlation between TG and ROS1 expression remained significant (r = -0.223, FDR-adjusted p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective, real-world cohort, only HDL levels demonstrated a robust difference between NSCLC patients and controls. Observed associations should be interpreted cautiously due to potential confounding factors and incomplete clinical data inherent to retrospective analyses. Prospective studies are needed to clarify whether lipid alterations play a biological or prognostic role in NSCLC.</description>

Naloxegol, a peripherally acting MOR antagonist (PAMORA), is approved for opioid-induced constipation. Safety and efficacy of naloxegol have not been evaluated concurrently with systemic cancer therapy. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of naloxegol in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma starting first-line systemic therapy. Results: Only 50 patients were enrolled; the trial was terminated early due to slow accrual. Two of the three components of the feasibility primary endpoint were not met (accrual and PRO completion). At 6 months, FACT-L emotional well-being was better with naloxegol (p = 0.0113). There were trends towards better Trial Outcome Index (p = 0.0505) and physical well-being (p = 0.0628) with naloxegol. Bowel function favored naloxegol for constipation (p = 0.0223), rectal pain during defecation (p = 0.0075), and abdominal pain from constipation (p = 0.0113). Adverse event frequency and severity, PRO-CTCAE, urinary hesitancy, pain scores, and progression-free and overall survival were comparable between naloxegol and placebo. Conclusions: Naloxegol appears to be safe and tolerable, with a signal of improved HRQoL and previously unappreciated benefit for emotional well-being, without adverse clinical outcomes. Our findings should be confirmed in larger studies. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03087708.</description>

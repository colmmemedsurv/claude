Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00614-X'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00614-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449147/'&gt;41449147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The CATNON trial investigated the benefit of the addition of concurrent or adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy in individuals with anaplastic astrocytoma. We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide. INTERPRETATION: Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hsu CH, Lu Z, Gao S, Wang J, Sun JM, Liu T, Fan Q, Cai J, Ge F, Li S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Lancet. Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449142/'&gt;41449142&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for additional and more efficacious therapies for patients with unresectable metastatic oesophageal cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding tiragolumab and atezolizumab to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: The SKYSCRAPER-08 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 67 centres in mainland China, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with treatment-naive, unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel [175 mg/m2] and cisplatin [60-80 mg/m2]) or placebo and chemotherapy through intravenous infusion for six 21-day cycles. The primary outcomes were independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned patients, regardless of whether they received any study treatment). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04540211, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, 461 patients were assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=229) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=232); 406 (88%) were male and 55 (12%) female, and all patients were Asian. Median survival follow-up was 12·6 months (IQR 6·8-18·0). Median independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival (cutoff June 15, 2022) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group was 6·2 months (95% CI 5·7-7·2) versus 5·4 months (95% CI 4·4-5·5) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·45-0·70; p&lt;0·0001). Median overall survival (cutoff Feb 13, 2023) was 15·7 months (95% CI 13·3-20·4) and 11·1 months (95% CI 9·6-13·6; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·88; p=0·0024). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group versus the placebo and chemotherapy group were white blood cell count decrease (46 [20%] of 228 vs 35 [15%] of 227), neutrophil count decrease (78 [34%] vs 78 [34%]), and anaemia (19 [8%] vs 24 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 94 (41%) of 228 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group and 89 (39%) of 227 in the placebo and chemotherapy group; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia (17 [7%] of 228 and 13 [6%] of 227). Treatment-related deaths occurred in six patients (3%) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group (immune-mediated lung disease, pneumonitis, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, and bacterial pneumonia) and two (1%) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (gastrointestinal infection and death of unknown cause). No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION: Independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group compared with chemotherapy alone for unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These data support the rationale for exploring dual checkpoint inhibition added to chemotherapy for this group of patients with a high unmet need.

A majority of men who have sex with men (MSM) were using oral tablets; meanwhile alternative long-acting modalities have been and are being developed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of PrEP use and the preferences of potential long-acting PrEP in the MSM community in Hong Kong, an Asian Pacific city where free or subsidised PrEP is not available. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. Eligible participants were adult MSM without HIV infection who normally resided in Hong Kong. Historical and current PrEP use, and preferences of using long-acting injectable for PrEP were tested against sociodemographic and sexual behavioural factors using chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 437 responses collected, 17% had ever used PrEP and 16% were currently using PrEP. Current PrEP users were more likely to have a higher income level (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.11, p = 0.04), have engaged in chemsex (aOR 4.02, p &lt; 0.01), have a non-regular male sex partner (aOR 2.66, p = 0.02), have a male sex partner living with HIV (aOR 3.60, p &lt; 0.01), and be inclined to have condomless sex in the future (aOR 6.86, p &lt; 0.01). Among ever users, MSM who discontinued PrEP had a lower sexual risk than current users, such as recent history of chemsex (OR 0.22, p &lt; 0.01) and inclination to have condomless sex (OR 0.15, p &lt; 0.01). Long-acting injectables were accepted by 27% MSM, who were more likely to be current PrEP users (odds ratio [OR] 2.35, p &lt; 0.01), concerned about efficacy (OR 1.66, p = 0.03), and expecting to use PrEP for more than 2 years in the future (OR 9.69, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of PrEP among MSM indicated an increased awareness over the past decade. However, its promotion could have been hindered by the absence of a publicly funded or subsidised programme. While PrEP users had a higher sexual risk, the utilisation pattern would be affected by the dynamicity of sexual activities. Long-acting injectables had a moderate acceptance rate. Current PrEP users and those anticipated long-term users could be prioritised for its promotion.</description>

Herein, we engineer a biohybrid delivery system through the integration of milk extracellular vesicles with liposomes. The hybrid vesicles employ targeting mechanisms via neonatal Fc receptor and peptide transporter 1, facilitating antibiotic transport across the proximal small intestine. These vesicles exhibit superior drug encapsulation efficiency, stable release behavior, efficient mucus traversal, higher endocytosis, increased basolateral exocytosis, and improved oral absorption, achieving a 3.24-fold increase in oral bioavailability compared to free antibiotics. In lung bacterial infections and bacteremia models, hybrid vesicle-encapsulated cefdinir outperforms free antibiotics in eliminating infections. Notably, this approach also mitigates adverse effects on the intestinal microbiota, safeguarding the animals from dysbiosis-associated metabolic syndromes and opportunistic pathogen infections. This innovative hybrid vesicle system holds promise for the oral delivery of other drugs that suffer from limited absorption or cause gut dysbiosis.</description>

METHODS: The synthesized age-period-cohort prediction method is used for projection. RESULTS: Among men, mortality from oral, prostate, and kidney cancers would increase by 2050. Esophageal and brain cancers follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from most other cancers would decline. Lung (18.54 % of all cancer deaths), prostate (17.25 %), oral (15.10 %), colorectal (11.11 %), and liver (9.07 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in men by 2050, accounting for 71.08 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from bladder and kidney cancers would slightly increase. Among women, mortality from ovarian cancer would increase steadily. Pancreatic, breast, cervical, endometrial, bladder, and brain cancers would follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from other cancers would decline. Lung (13.63 %), breast (13.06 %), bladder (12.90 %), colorectal (12.81 %), and pancreatic (11.24 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in women by 2050, accounting for 63.65 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from ovarian cancer would increase from 3.57 % to 5.42 % (from 2023 to 2050). CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, prostate, pancreatic, endometrial, ovarian, and bladder cancers are projected to surpass their observation in past and may become new threat in future.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; de Oliveira KH, de Oliveira Ferreira B, da Silva Junior FJ, Barp LFG, de Menezes Guerra CB, da Silva Câmara FD, de Almeida Soares MA, Bercht G, Honorato IB, Gagliolo AA, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-25211-9'&gt;10.1186/s12889-025-25211-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41437237/'&gt;41437237&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a highly effective biomedical prevention strategy, recommended by the World Health Organization since 2015. However, in South America, its adoption has been uneven, reflecting structural, political, and socio-cultural inequalities. This study maps and analyzes national PrEP policies across 13 South American countries through an intersectional lens, identifying challenges and opportunities for more equitable HIV prevention strategies. METHODS: We conducted a documentary survey of national PrEP-related policies, clinical guidelines, regulations, and public communications from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Searches were performed on institutional websites in Portuguese, Spanish, English, and French using predefined keywords. In the absence of official policy documents, information was collected from media and civil society sources. Data from 118 documents were coded and analyzed using iterative summative content analysis, integrating intersectionality theory to assess how policies address (or neglect) structural inequalities. RESULTS: Ten countries have formal national PrEP policies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay), with Brazil pioneering implementation in 2017. Three countries (Bolivia, Suriname, Venezuela) lack comprehensive national guidelines. Most countries recommend daily oral PrEP; on-demand dosing is approved in fewer contexts, often with restrictions. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir has been approved only in Brazil, French Guiana, and Peru, but remains largely unavailable. Geographic coverage ranges from national to highly localized models. Prioritized groups include men who have sex with men, transgender women, sex workers, serodifferent couples, and, in some countries, people who use drugs. Policy formulation involves ministries of health, academia, international organizations, and, variably, civil society. However, inclusion of marginalized populations and integration of intersectional approaches remain limited. There are inequalities in the incorporation of social markers of difference in PrEP policies across the region, with greater emphasis on sexuality, gender, class, and health conditions, and limited attention to race/ethnicity, territory, generation, and disability. CONCLUSION: PrEP policy adoption in South America demonstrates significant heterogeneity, shaped by intersecting social, political, and institutional factors. While the region has made notable advances, access remains uneven, with structural barriers such as stigma, regulatory gaps, and geographic inequities limiting impact. Incorporating intersectional perspectives into policy design and implementation is essential to ensure that PrEP - in all its modalities - is accessible as a right to health, addressing differences across multiple social, geographic, and economic dimensions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sharma Y, Castellanos J, Suero-Tejeda N, Bockting W, Kronish IM, Schwartz JE, Wall MM, Caceres BA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-24061-9'&gt;10.1186/s12889-025-24061-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41436990/'&gt;41436990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Stigmatized adults in the United States experience significant hypertension disparities that may be influenced by greater exposure to discrimination. Although discrimination is posited to contribute to hypertension disparities, researchers have largely focused on the role of experienced discrimination with limited examination of other types of discrimination, such as anticipated and vicarious discrimination. Existing research ignores intersectional discrimination, which obscures the experiences of those that face discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities. This study addresses limitations of prior work by examining the influence of intersectional anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure in adults within their real-world contexts. METHODS: This 7-day intensive longitudinal study uses an intersectional approach to examine the influence of daily and chronic forms of anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure and mediators of these associations. The proposed sample includes 400 adults (ages 18-64) living in New York City that are diverse in terms of ethnoracial, sexual, and gender identities. The study includes two in-person visits and a 7-day home assessment. Participants will complete a baseline structured interview, daily structured morning diaries, daily structured evening diaries, self-collection of saliva samples to assess salivary stress biomarkers, continuous wrist-worn actigraphy, and home blood pressure monitoring. We will test physiological (e.g., salivary cortisol), behavioral (e.g., sleep duration and physical activity), and affective (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms) factors to determine whether they mediate the influence of anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure. We will use multilevel linear models to estimate within- and between-person effects of daily and chronic anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure. DISCUSSION: My Heart, My Self addresses significant limitations in prior research on the link between discrimination and cardiovascular health. Our findings may shed light on effects of indirect forms of discrimination on blood pressure. This work will inform behavioral interventions that target anticipated and vicarious discrimination as risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</description>

We developed curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) 3, a uniformly processed collection of over 22,000 human microbiome samples with manually curated metadata from 94 studies and 42 countries. This large and diverse resource allows for meta-analysis of the links between microbes and human health. Through meta-analysis, we identified hundreds of microbial species and thousands of microbial functions significantly associated with a person's sex, age, body mass index, and disease status, and catalog these as references. We developed an "oral enrichment score" (OES) based on the relative abundance of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity and not in the gut. Higher OES in the gut is a consistent feature in individuals with disease, suggesting that the relative abundance of oral bacteria in the gut is a simple and quantifiable signal of altered microbiome health. These analyses identify modest but widely shared patterns in human microbiomes, serving as a reproducible and readily updatable reference.</description>

Cigarette smoking prevalence exceeds 30% in much of the region. Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), which contain nicotine but no tobacco, present an unexplored opportunity to reduce cigarette smoking and cancer incidence. OBJECTIVES: We outline the protocol for the Appalachian Research to Impact Smoking's Effects (ARISE) study, a randomized controlled trial to determine whether ONPs affect cigarette smoking patterns short- and long-term, and to evaluate their abuse liability versus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in a large sample of Appalachian smokers (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06763536). METHODS: Between 2025 and 2029, we will recruit 1,000 adult smokers living in rural Appalachian counties across 11 states. Participants will be identified via media outreach, mobile cancer screening, community events, and respondent-driven sampling, then randomized to ONP or NRT and complete four study phases: Baseline, Sampling, Switch, and Observation. In the Sampling phase, participants will receive varied flavors and nicotine strengths of their assigned product and select preferred options for use. During the Switch Phase, they will attempt to quit smoking and switch completely to their assigned product. The Observation phase will monitor tobacco use after discontinuation of study products. Study procedures will be conducted online and by mail, including surveys, expired carbon monoxide verification, and product delivery. The primary outcome is 7-day biochemically verified cigarette abstinence at the end of the Switch Phase. Secondary outcomes include switching rates, product appeal, craving, withdrawal, dependence, and purchases during the Observation phase. An intention-to-treat log-binomial regression model will estimate the effect of intervention assignment on cigarette abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Results will inform whether and how ONPs should be regulated, approached clinically, and used in public health interventions to reduce the burdens of cigarette smoking in Appalachia.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split mouth RCT was designed with 216 MAGRD that were assigned to VISTA alone and VISTA with A-PRF. The complete root coverage (CRC) and gingival thickness (GT) were measured using CBCT at baseline and 12 months post-operatively, while the clinical parameters of probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized gingival (WKG), gingival recession depth (GRD), and gingival recession width (GRW) were recorded at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. RESULTS: From baseline to 12 months, there was a significant decrease in the mean values of GRD and GRW with an increase in WKG. CBCT scans showed a significant increase in GT mean values. According to these results, the Test group's CRC was higher (95.92%) than the Control groups (85.02%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the Control group, the Test group demonstrated superior MAGRD resolution in achieving a decrease in GRD and GRW as well as a higher increase in WKG and GT. These findings resulted into a substantially more CRC for the Test group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration no. CTRI/2022/09/045845. Registered on: 26/09/2022.</description>

This study explores how CCCs collect, interpret, and use assessment data to evaluate resident performance and progress. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study using focus groups with OHNS faculty who serve on CCCs at the November 2024 Society of University Otolaryngologists meeting. Discussions explored the types of assessment data gathered and how this information is interpreted and applied. Audio recordings were transcribed, de-identified, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one CCC members participated in three seven-person focus groups. Thematic analysis revealed the following findings related to CCC decision-making: (1) There is substantial heterogeneity in the types of data collected and used; (2) Narrative and verbal feedback outweighed structured data; (3) Challenges emerged due to a need to transform informal feedback into documented, defensible data for high-stakes decisions. Gaps in the CCC process included: (1) Collection of data that is ultimately unused in decision-making; (2) A lack of structured mechanisms to encourage faculty engagement and development for performing assessments; and (3) A focus on identifying struggling residents rather than fostering development across all levels of trainee performance. CONCLUSIONS: OHNS CCCs rely on a heterogeneous mix of formal and informal data, with narrative feedback often the most influential in decision-making. The process is challenged by data overload, variable faculty engagement, and a lack of standardization. Addressing such challenges may improve the quality, equity, and transparency of resident assessment and progression decisions.</description>

Aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death in advanced AD. Superior laryngeal nerve(SLN) dysfunction is hypothesized to be responsible for poor laryngeal sensation and aspiration pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to compare SLN neurophysiology in an AD rat model to control animals. METHODS: SLN-evoked studies were performed via stimulation of the main trunk in 4-month-old adult apolipoprotein-E4 (ApoE4-KI) rats (n = 8) versus wild-type rats (n = 10). Recording electrodes were placed on the internal branch of the SLN (iSLN) and cricothyroid muscles. Stimulated swallow force measurements from hyoid elevation were compared between groups. Outcome measures included both sensory and motor evoked responses. Additionally, force and frequency of electrically and tactile stimulated swallow reflexes were analyzed. RESULTS: Sensory nerve action potential duration was significantly longer in APOE-KI rats than controls with a mean difference (95% CI) of 2.24 ms (1.08-3.41). Both compound motor action potential latency and total duration were significantly longer in the APOE4-KI rats than controls with a mean difference (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.115-0.33) and 2.18 (0.90-3.4) respectively. Tactile-stimulated swallow frequency was significantly lower in the AD cohort vs. controls with a mean difference of -5.4 swallows/10 s (-7.6, -3.2). CONCLUSIONS: SLN evoked responses were significantly longer with a decrease in swallow frequency in an AD rat model compared to age-matched controls. This work suggests differences in SLN signaling between the cohorts. This work may provide a mechanistic understanding of SLN dysfunction and a tractable model to test new treatments for swallow dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

This work was designed to present the uvularis muscle advancement technique in a selected group of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients, assess the surgical applicability, and report the surgical outcomes. METHODS: Thirty-four adult patients with single-level OSA who showed a predominant anteroposterior pattern of collapse at the retropalatal region were stratified into two groups: Group A underwent modified anterior palatoplasty (MAP) only, and Group B had modified anterior palatoplasty with uvularis muscle advancement (MAP-UMA). RESULTS: At 6-8 months, a highly significant improvement was reported as regards the mean apnea hypopnea index (MAP group; from 12.9 to 5.7; MAP-UMA group: from 19.1 to 4.0) and the mean lowest oxygen saturation (MAP group; from 89.9 to 93.7; MAP-UMA group: from 88.7 to 94.3; P &lt; 0.000) in both groups; but the comparison of both groups showed non-significant differences (p &gt; 0.05). The visual analog scale of snoring and Epworth Sleepiness Scale showed a significant (p &lt; 0.05) reduction in both groups; the comparison between groups was highly significant towards MAP-UMA. According to Sher's criteria, successful outcomes were reported in 27 patients (79.41%); MAP = 13 (76.47%), MAP-UMA = 14 (82.35%). The overall percentage of improvement (of the study group) was 78.65 ± 5.41%. CONCLUSION: MAP-UMA is an effective procedure in patients with OSA who show a predominant retropalatal collapse. UMA results in a significant improvement in snoring. It could be incorporated into multi-level surgery in OSA.</description>

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for studies published up to March 2025. English-language studies that directly compared ECD and PSP in patients with benign parotid tumors were included. Data were extracted independently by two authors, and meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Outcomes included operative duration, drainage volume, hospital stay, tumor size, incidences of Frey syndrome, facial nerve (FN) injury (temporary and permanent), recurrence, as well as the rate of complete tumor excision. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Compared with PSP, ECD was associated with shorter operative duration (mean difference [MD], - 15.42 min; 95% confidence interval [CI], - 23.47 to - 7.37), lower drainage volume (MD, - 31.32 mL; 95% CI, - 32.88 to - 29.76), shorter hospital stay (MD, - 0.54 days; 95% CI, - 0.78 to - 0.29), and reduced rates of both Frey syndrome (risk difference [RD], - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.05 to - 0.00) and temporary FN injury (RD, - 0.12; 95% CI, - 0.20 to - 0.05). No significant differences were found in tumor size, recurrence, permanent FN injury, complete excision rate, or other complications. CONCLUSION: ECD and PSP demonstrate comparable surgical safety for benign parotid tumors. ECD offers certain perioperative advantages and may be a suitable option for appropriately selected patients. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these findings.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study included 125 patients diagnosed with ISSNHL between 2012 and 2021 who received both oral prednisone and intratympanic methylprednisolone. Clinical data and pre-treatment blood samples were collected. Inflammatory indices including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), and systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) were calculated. Hearing outcomes were classified as complete, partial, or no recovery based on pure tone average (PTA) thresholds. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of recovery. RESULTS: Of the 125 patients, 33 (26.4%) had no recovery, 50 (40.0%) partial recovery, and 42 (33.6%) complete recovery. Dizziness, current smoking, delayed treatment initiation (&gt; 7 days), elevated triglycerides (≥ 98 mg/dL), and high PLR (≥ 142) were independently associated with a lower probability of hearing recovery. A higher LMR (≥ 3.0) showed a positive trend but did not reach statistical significance in adjusted models. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ISSNHL treated with dual-route corticosteroids, several clinical and hematologic factors, particularly elevated PLR and delayed treatment, are independently associated with reduced odds of hearing recovery. Inflammatory blood markers may serve as accessible prognostic tools to support early risk stratification.</description>

We present a rare case of acute laryngeal dyspnoea resulting from a cervical spine spondylodiscitis (CSS) with an underlying oesophageal fistula. CASE REPORT: A 70 year-old-man presented with swallowing disorders, dysphonia and laryngeal dyspnoea one day after a revision surgery for abdominal bowel evisceration. The MRI showed a multilevel spondylodiscitis extending from C4 to C7, associated with epiduritis and an anterior epidural abscess causing spinal cord compression. The treatment included temporary tracheotomy, the wearing of a cervical collar, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics during 6 weeks and the interruption of food oral intake. The patient showed a good clinical improvement. CONCLUSION: Special attention should be given to a fever or neck pain in patients with risk factors of CSS, such as history of head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. An urgent treatment is required to avoid complications such as compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerves, either a conservative one with antibiotics or a surgical one.</description>

Given the immunomodulatory potential of female hormones, hormonal contraceptive use could influence lymphoma risk, yet existing research is inconclusive. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between contemporary hormonal contraceptive use and lymphoma risk in a nationwide Danish cohort of women aged 15-49 years (1995-2021). Women with prior cancer, hysterectomy, oophorectomy, or sterilization were excluded. Data on hormonal contraceptive use, lymphomas, and confounders were retrieved from national registries. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for any hormonal contraceptive use and lymphoma risk, including lymphoma subtypes, contraceptive types, duration of use, and time since last use. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During 24.5 million person-years of follow-up, 1777 lymphomas (686 Hodgkin, 1091 non-Hodgkin) occurred among 1,957,490 women. Ever using hormonal contraception was associated with reduced lymphoma risk (IRR 0.84, 95%CI 0.75-0.94), with similar IRRs across lymphoma types. This was driven by current/recent use of both combined products (IRR 0.80, 95%CI 0.70-0.91) and progestin-only products (IRR 0.81, 95%CI 0.67-0.97), especially oral combined and non-oral progestin-only products. Risk decreased with longer use, with the lowest risk for use &gt;10 years (IRR 0.53, 95%CI 0.33-0.85), but no long-term sustained protective effect was seen after cessation. CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that hormonal contraceptive use may have a role in lymphoma etiology and confer protective effects, underscoring the need to explore hormonal pathways in both a preventive and therapeutic context.</description>

Patients from tribal communities often face unique sociocultural and communication barriers that affect their engagement in care. Effective patient-physician communication improves satisfaction, adherence, and quality of life. This study aims to assess the consultation satisfaction and effectiveness of a Question Prompt List (QPL) in enhancing patient-physician communication and promoting informed decision-making among cancer patients in a tribal population in Meghalaya, India. METHODS: A quasi-experimental design was employed involving 60 participants diagnosed with head and neck, gastrointestinal, or respiratory cancers. Participants were assigned to an intervention group that received the QPL and a control group that received standard care. Data on consultation satisfaction and patient feedback were collected across two follow-up sessions. RESULTS: The intervention group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in multiple domains of consultation satisfaction, including physicians' responsiveness, patients' confidence in asking questions, understanding of disease and treatment plans, and discussions of financial aspects. In contrast, the control group showed no significant change across follow-ups. Patient feedback indicated high levels of agreement regarding the QPL's usefulness, clarity, and ability to facilitate meaningful communication. CONCLUSION: The QPL significantly enhanced patient satisfaction and engagement, demonstrating its effectiveness as a low-cost, culturally adaptable communication tool for oncology consultations among tribal populations. Integrating QPLs into routine oncology practice could strengthen patient-centred care and reduce communication barriers in underserved regions.</description>

The regulatory role of this protein has been documented across a variety of cancers. Emphasizing its role in cancer biology, this study employed computer aided drug design (CADD) approach, including molecular docking, dynamics and pharmacoinformatics, to screen fungal metabolites as potential anticancer agents. Subsequent assessments of pharmacokinetics and toxicity revealed that all tested fungal metabolites possessed oral bioavailability, drug-like characteristics, and favorable ADMET profiles. The metabolites also exhibited no hepatotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or mutagenicity, highlighting their significant therapeutic potential and favorable safety profile. The docking analysis further revealed strong binding affinities of the metabolites with the SIRT2, with the MSID001658 showing the highest score (-10.9 kcal/mol), followed by the MSID000672 (-10.2 kcal/mol). Further molecular dynamics simulation evaluated the structural and dynamic stabilities of the SIRT2 in association with the ligands. Although both complexes showed overall stability, the MSID000672 had larger RMSD variations, whereas the MSID001658 maintained consistent structural integrity throughout the simulation. Furthermore, the binding of MSID000672 was associated with increased solvent exposure, in contrast to the more compact molecular surface area (MolSA) and radius of gyration (Rg) profile observed for the MSID001658. The PCA indicated compact clustering (53.6%) for the SIRT2_MSID000672 complex, whereas the SIRT2_MSID001658 had a larger variance (70.9%) of flexibility. The DCCM further revealed enhanced coordination of internal movements in the SIRT2_MSID000672 complexes. Finally, the MSID001658 fosters a compact, stable complex with the SIRT2, whereas the MSID000672 increases conformational flexibility and solvent accessibility. These results support the notion that the MSID000672 might be an effective anticancer agent if subjected to more experimental trials.</description>

The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is dysregulated and associated with poor prognosis in NHL. The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has preclinical activity in hematologic malignancy models. METHODS: NCT05008055 was a modular, open-label, multicenter phase II study that examined oral capivasertib monotherapy in patients with R/R B-cell NHL who had received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. Patients had R/R FL (Cohort 1A), MZL (Cohort 1B), or MCL (Cohort 1C). Capivasertib 480 mg twice daily was administered orally 4 days on/3 days off. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: 30 patients were enrolled (of 272 planned). The ORRs for patients with R/R FL, MZL, and MCL were 18.8% (3/16), 33.3% (1/3), and 30% (3/10), respectively; 62.5% (10/16) of patients with R/R FL had stable disease. Baseline tumor PTEN expression was deficient/undetectable in the two patients who had a complete response and three of five patients who had a partial response. The most common capivasertib-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (63.3%), nausea (20%), vomiting (13.3%), and hyperglycemia (10%). Capivasertib-related grade ≥3 AEs or serious AEs were observed in 9 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study was terminated early with a small sample size, limiting interpretation, although antitumor activity was limited. Future studies of capivasertib in hematologic malignancies would likely require biomarker-directed patient selection and/or combination therapy.</description>

METHODS: The All of Us database was queried for participants with sialolithiasis. These participants were matched to controls by age, race, and gender. Demographics and medical history data, such as obesity, hypertension, tonsillitis, gout, and other conditions associated with salivary stones, were extracted and compared among participants. A logistic regression model using optimized parameters was used to identify variables associated with sialolithiasis. RESULTS: In total, 2160 participants were included in the analysis, with 540 diagnosed with sialolithiasis and 1620 matched controls. Sjogren's syndrome (OR = 2.057, 95% CI: 1.106-3.824, p = 0.023) and obesity (OR = 1.419, 95% CI: 1.118-1.802, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with increased odds of sialolithiasis, while essential hypertension (OR = 0.279, 95% CI: 0.23-0.339, p = 0.0) and Type 2 diabetes without complication (OR = 0.771, 95% CI: 0.601-0.989, p = 0.041) were inversely associated. No significant associations were observed for dehydration, hyperparathyroidism, acute tonsillitis, alcohol abuse, smoking, hypercalcemia, gout, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis, or bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using a large-scale database, aimed to identify potential risk factors associated with sialolithiasis, thereby improving our understanding of its pathogenesis and paving the way for early diagnosis and intervention. The commonality among the identified risk factors appears to be their association with reduced salivary flow or alterations in fluid dynamics and composition, which are known contributors to the formation of salivary stones.</description>

No biotherapeutic injectable exists that directs laryngeal reinnervation after RLN injury. Placental-derived connective tissue matrix (pd-CTM) could fill this need, as it contains a plethora of cytokines with potential UVFP therapeutic benefits. This study aimed to identify and quantify the factors in a commercially available pd-CTM (CTM Flow, CTM Biomedical, Lake Worth, Florida) and to study the effects of pd-CTM on vocal fold microenvironment and glottic function in a mouse model of unilateral RLN injury. METHODS: Cytokine expression (ng/mL) in pd-CTM was characterized using a cytokine array and ELISA. In a separate experiment, C57/BL6 mice were divided into three groups: uninjured negative controls (n = 12), RLN transection with ipsilateral saline thyroarytenoid (TA) injection (n = 16), and RLN transection with ipsilateral pd-CTM TA injection. Outcomes included laryngeal electromyography (L-EMG) and video laryngoscopy after 7 and 28 days, with larynges then harvested and analyzed via immunohistochemistry (IHC) and qPCR. RESULTS: pd-CTM characterization showed moderate-to-high levels of neurotrophic (BDNF, CNTF, GDNF, NTF-3), angiogenic (Angiogenin, VEGF-D), tissue remodeling (bFGF, IGF-1, HGF, TGF-β3), and anti-inflammatory factors (IL-10, IL-1Rα). L-EMG demonstrated increased mean normalized area under the curve ratio in pd-CTM treated mice compared to saline treated mice at the 28-day time point indicating reinnervation (p &lt; 0.001). IHC detected innervated neuromuscular junctions 28 days after pd-CTM treatment. CONCLUSION: pd-CTM may be a novel treatment option for patients with UVFP based on the neurotrophic, angiogenic, tissue remodeling, and anti-inflammatory factors present. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA.</description>

This study evaluated whether automated creak distinguished speakers with adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD), primary muscle tension dysphonia (pMTD), and those without voice disorders during conversational speech. METHODS: Two stimulus types (reading passage and conversational speech) were produced by 50 speakers with AdLD, 50 speakers with pMTD, and 50 control speakers. An automated creak detector was used to calculate the percentage (%) of creak in both stimuli. The effects of group, stimulus type, and their interaction on % creak were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted and the area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the creak detector in distinguishing among groups. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant effect of group on % creak, but no effect of stimulus type on % creak, suggesting that creak distinguished speakers with AdLD, pMTD, and controls during both a reading passage and conversational speech. AUC values indicated acceptable discriminative ability in distinguishing AdLD speakers from both pMTD speakers and controls across both stimuli types. CONCLUSION: Automated creak demonstrates promise as a discriminative feature for identifying differences between speakers with AdLD from pMTD and controls in both a reading passage and conversational speech.</description>

The primary endpoint was the pathological complete response assessed by two independent pathologists and was defined as no residual viable tumours at both the primary tumour site and all the lymph nodes. The secondary endpoints included adverse events and overall survival time. In total, 85.4% of patients experienced adverse events of any grade, and 4.2% reported Grade 3 adverse events; 45 patients underwent pathological evaluation, 14 (31.1%, 95% confidence interval, 18.2-46.6%) achieved pathological complete response, and the two-year survival rate was 88.3%. Imaging mass cytometry revealed that patients without pathological complete response presented immunosuppressive molecule expression, and expanded immunosuppressive fibroblast neighbourhoods. Here we show, serplulimab and chemotherapy are associated with modest antitumour activity and a tolerable safety profile in patients with locally advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. A phase 3 randomised trial featuring continued follow-up is essential for a formal evaluation. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05659251.</description>

Recent studies in multiple breast cancer mouse models have found that antibiotics, by altering the gut microbiota, can accelerate tumour growth. In humans, a recent cohort study restricted to triple negative breast cancer showed that breast cancer patients using a greater number of antibiotics had markedly worse survival. These studies have raised concerns about repeated antibiotic use in breast cancer patients. In this Registered Report, we investigated whether breast cancer patients using oral antibiotics had increased breast cancer-specific mortality. In population-based cohorts (n = 44,452), we did not observe a statistically significant association between antibiotic prescriptions after diagnosis and breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 1.07 95% CI 0.87, 1.33) apart from prescriptions of 12 or more antibiotics (adjusted HR = 1.62 95% CI 1.31, 2.01). This association was weaker after adjustment for infections (adjusted HR = 1.44 95% 1.14, 1.81), when restricted to antibiotics within five years (adjusted HR = 1.33 95% 0.95, 1.84), and was similar for deaths from other causes (adjusted HR = 1.69 95% 1.19, 2.41). Frequent antibiotic users had higher cancer-specific mortality but the attenuation of associations in sensitivity analyses, and similar findings for other causes of death, suggest this increase may reflect residual confounding.

METHODS: ProsD is a phase-II double-blinded randomized trial of newly diagnosed, low-intermediate risk PC cases, aged between 50 and 80 years and on AS. The intervention was a monthly oral dose of cholecalciferol (50,000IU; Vitamin D) or placebo. Primary and secondary endpoints were active therapy-free (ATFS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, respectively. Blood samples were analysed for vitamin D metabolites and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN) markers for lymphocytic genome damage. RESULTS: There were 123 randomised participants (81 vitamin D and 42 placebo) included in this analysis. Mean (SD) for age was 66.5 (6.6) years and for 25(OH)D levels were 72.0 (19.9) and 66.4 (18.4) nmol/L at baseline (p = 0.1), and 91.9 (19.9) and 60.4 (24.4) nmol/L at 24 months, in the vitamin D and placebo arms respectively. There were no appreciable differences in ATFS (plog-rank = 0.44), PFS (p plog-rank = 0.60) and occurrence of adverse events, in each trial arm. There were declines in some of the lymphocytic CBMN markers in the vitamin D arm. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did not prevent PC progression, although reduced prevalence of CBMN markers may indicate a benefit of vitamin D supplementation.

To address this unmet clinical need, we perform proteomic and bioinformatic analyses and identify lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as a critical driver of LNM in ESCC. LAMP1 is markedly overexpressed in primary tumors that with LNM and correlates with worse survival outcomes across independent cohorts. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments demonstrate that LAMP1 promotes lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, LAMP1 interacts with DNA-PKcs, mediates AKT activation, leading to VEGFC upregulation and secretion, thereby driving lymphangiogenesis and metastasis. Importantly, treatment with the LAMP1 inhibitor Parishin C significantly suppresses LNM in preclinical ESCC models. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized LAMP1/DNA-PKcs/AKT/VEGFC signaling axis that promotes ESCC progression and highlight LAMP1 as a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for preventing LNM and improving patient outcomes.</description>

We aim to construct a short-term prediction model for the daily incidence of common intestinal infectious diseases in Changzhou city. METHODS: The daily incidence data of hand, foot, and mouth disease and other infectious diarrhea in Changzhou and the daily meteorological data and air pollutant data in the same period were collected from May 13, 2014 to December 31, 2024. The meteorological data consisted of temperature, humidity, wind speed, air pressure, etc. Air pollutant data included PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3, and AQI indicators. Three models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer, and a hybrid model combining seasonal trend decomposition with Transformer, were constructed and compared. Additionally, an advanced STL-T-L hybrid model (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess, Transformer, and LSTM) was proposed for further analysis. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the hyperparameters of the deep learning model. The model integrated historical incidence data, environmental factors, and engineered time characteristics, lag terms, and rolling statistics. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute scale error (MASE) were calculated on the independent test set to evaluate the prediction performance of the model. RESULTS: Among all the evaluated models, the STL-T-L hybrid model showed the best prediction performance on the test set, with RMSE of 6.337, MAE of 4.524, MAPE of 58.482%, MASE of 0.638. The prediction model built in this study considered the historical incidence of the disease and incorporated various meteorological and air pollution factors. The results showed that the STL-T-L model incorporating these features achieved the best prediction results. CONCLUSION: The STL-T-L model can effectively predict the common intestinal infectious diseases and can be used as a tool for monitoring and early warning of intestinal infectious diseases in Changzhou.</description>

APX3330 selectively inhibits Ref-1's redox function without affecting its DNA repair role. This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study in advanced solid tumors was aimed at determining the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) while assessing safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker evidence of target engagement. METHODS: Nineteen cancer patients were treated, with eight completing follow-up. Subjects received APX3330 orally twice daily in 21-day cycles, starting at 240 mg/day and escalating in 120 mg/day increments. Adverse event (AE) monitoring followed a 1 pt/cohort approach until a &gt;G2 toxicity event, after which a 3 + 3 design was implemented. Treatment continued until disease progression, consent withdrawal, or intolerable toxicity. Antitumor activity was assessed using RECIST 1.1, and pharmacodynamic markers included serum Ref-1 levels and circulating tumor cells. RESULTS: Six of nineteen subjects had stable disease, and no treatment-related SAEs were observed. One subject (720 mg cohort) withdrew due to Grade 3 maculopapular rash (dose-limiting toxicity). Laboratory assessments and ECGs showed no clinically significant abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: APX3330 showed preliminary signals of disease control and on-target pharmacology in this first-in-human study. Based on safety and PD, the RP2D is 600 mg/day. Given the small sample size, efficacy conclusions are exploratory (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03375086).</description>

Although many studies have examined HPV knowledge, vaccine acceptance, and uptake in university students, findings remain heterogeneous, and comprehensive quantitative synthesis is limited. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess global estimates of university students' knowledge of HPV and its vaccine, willingness to receive the vaccine, and actual vaccination behaviors. METHODS: The study was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 2020 Checklist. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wan Fang Database for studies published from January 2006 through August 2024. Studies with quality assessment scores &gt; 5 and published in Chinese or English were included for data extraction. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. The heterogeneity statistic I-squared and corresponding p value were also reported. RESULTS: A total of 56 studies covering 184,351 university students from four continents (Asia, Africa, Europe and North America) were included. Among students, 68.3% (95% CI 56.4%-79.0%) and 53.5% (95% CI 53.0%-54.1%) were aware of HPV and HPV vaccine, respectively, with significant gaps in knowledge about HPV symptoms, cervical cancer screening methods, and optimal vaccination timing. Pooled HPV vaccination willingness was 52.9% (95% CI 44.2%-61.6%), with higher willingness observed among females and medical students. Only 10.4% (95% CI 6.1%-15.8%) had received at least 1 dose of vaccination and 12.4% (95% CI 3.0%-26.9%) had completed the full three-dose schedule. Vaccination coverage among females was 8.6% (95% CI 3.7%-15.1%), and among medical students, 7.7% (95% CI 1.3%-18.4%). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that university students exhibit limited awareness of HPV and its vaccine, with about half willing to be vaccinated. Actual vaccination rates remain low and vary widely by gender, major, time of year, and geographic regions. These findings highlight the need for targeted intervention strategies, such as precision education and cross-sector collaboration, to effectively increase HPV vaccination coverage in this population.</description>

We aimed to determine the prognostic value of LVI and develop a modified post-neoadjuvant pathologic staging (ypStage) system integrating LVI and ypTNM stage to improve risk stratification. METHODS: This multi-institutional study included patients with ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and R0 resection. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to derive prognostic groupings. A modified ypStage system was developed, validated, and compared with ypTNM stage. RESULTS: A total of 931 patients were divided into training (n = 565) and external validation (n = 366) cohorts. LVI was present in 115 patients (12.4%). LVI was an independent predictor of survival and disease recurrence, with hazard ratios of 1.70 for overall survival and 1.74 for recurrence-free survival. By integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage, nonmetastatic ESCC were classified into three stages with distinct prognoses. The proposed RPA stage provided superior hazard consistency, hazard discrimination, sample size balance, and outcome prediction over ypTNM stage. CONCLUSIONS: LVI was a strong prognostic factor, independent of the current ypTNM stage in ESCC. We developed an RPA-based ypStage system integrating LVI status and ypTNM stage that exhibited good prognostic performance.</description>

Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer.</description>

A significant proportion of penicillin allergy labels are incorrect; here we review the published evidence on the costs, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness of penicillin allergy testing. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published economic evaluations of penicillin allergy testing in accordance with Cochrane guidelines. We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, EconPapers (RePeC) and the International HTA Database (INAHTA) and included reports of full or partial economic evaluations of costs and/or health benefits of penicillin allergy testing strategies. The outcomes of interest were healthcare resource use, medical costs, and health-related quality of life for patients with a penicillin allergy label and for patients with the label removed, and cost-effectiveness. We evaluated the methodological quality of the studies using a published checklist designed for systematic reviews. The review followed a narrative synthesis. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies analysed the effect of testing on the costs of antibiotic use among patients admitted to hospital with a PAL. Studies measured costs of testing (n = 19); antibiotic medication use (n = 23); adverse reactions with penicillin use (n = 4), alternative antibiotic drugs (n = 3); length of hospital stay (n = 5); subsequent health care use episodes (n = 4); and antibiotic medication use in subsequent care episodes (n = 3). The median cost of skin testing plus oral challenge across six primary costing studies was USD 246 (range: 164, 514), which contrasts with the USD 42-258 range of antibiotic cost savings during the initial hospital admission. Two studies presented evidence that penicillin allergy testing is cost-saving in an outpatient setting over 3.5-4.5 years. One model-based study reported that testing in inpatient settings is cost-saving. No reports on the effect of penicillin allergy testing on health-related quality of life were found and the two cost-effectiveness studies that accounted for this outcome employed the opinion of healthcare professional or an assumption of a common generic value for adverse reactions. CONCLUSIONS: While penicillin allergy testing shows promise in reducing antibiotic costs, the evidence remains insufficient to definitively establish whether these savings consistently outweigh testing costs across various healthcare settings.</description>

Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) play a crucial role in the immune response and significantly influence the efficacy of immunotherapy. However, the prognostic and immunological implications of TLS-associated molecular subtypes in LUSC remain unclear. In this study, we applied 10 multi-omics integration strategies to perform a multi-omics analysis of the mRNA expression profiles, DNA methylation, and genomic mutation data of 39 TLSs-related genes, along with long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles, to generate integrated consensus subtypes of LUSC. Four molecular subtypes were identified: cancer subtype 1 (CS1), CS2, CS3, and CS4. We observed a significant difference in overall survival between cancer subtype 1 (CS1) and CS3. Subsequently, we identified 33 prognosis-related genes based on differential expression between CS1 and CS3, which were further refined to 20 genes using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression algorithm, and constructed a prognostic signature termed the LUSC-Survival Prediction Index (LUSCSPI). The high-LUSCSPI group demonstrated a poor prognosis and was more likely to benefit from treatment with nine chemotherapeutic agents (shikonin, doxorubicin, CMK, S-Trityl-L-cysteine, paclitaxel, DMOG, gemcitabine, erlotinib, and crizotinib). In contrast, the low-LUSCSPI group exhibited a more favorable prognosis, with thapsigargin and cisplatin identified as promising treatment options. In conclusion, our results highlight the potential of LUSCSPI as an independent prognostic factor for LUSC. Further, the multi-omics consensus approach provides a robust foundation for prognostic stratification in LUSC patients, facilitating personalized treatment and disease management.</description>

Host behavior is an important component of this axis, and variation in individual animal personalities can shape the dynamics, composition, and evolutionary trajectory of an ecosystem. Relative boldness or shyness is a commonly used personality metric across vertebrate animals, and the composition of an organism's microbiome may be important in shaping this trait. Turtles have been poorly characterized in terms of behavior and microbiome, though they are the most threatened vertebrate group on Earth and therefore warrant more study. To address this gap, we compared the gut microbiota of bold and shy Eastern Box Turtles to investigate any correlation between microbial composition and personality type. Free-ranging Eastern Box Turtles were captured and assayed for their personality, and cloacal, skin, and oral swab samples were collected. Microbial DNA from swabs was amplified and sequenced. Female turtles had significantly higher alpha microbial diversities than male turtles and shy turtles had a significantly higher microbial diversity than bold turtles. Four significantly overabundant bacteria were found (two in bold turtles and two in shy turtles). The steroid biosynthesis pathway was significantly overrepresented in bold turtles, while the bile acid biosynthesis pathway and purine degradation to urea modules were significantly overrepresented in shy turtles. Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria are implicated in the classification of Eastern Box Turtle personality. While our conclusions should be considered in the context of limited sample sizes, our data suggest prominent metabolic pathways, modules, and bacteria that are implicated in different Eastern Box Turtle personality types, suggesting a possible microbial influence on the personality of this well-known but threatened species.</description>

While various clinical features suggest ODS, diagnosing some ODS patients can be challenging. This study aimed to determine the value of maxillary sinus papillary edema (MSPE) in predicting ODS. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent at least maxillary antrostomy for unilateral sinus disease (USD). Adequately powered samples of three USD cohorts were generated: ODS, infectious maxillary CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and noninfectious CRSwNP. Multiple variables were collected, but the primary outcome was MSPE presence via double-blinded endoscopic image review by three rhinologists. Inter-rater agreement was calculated, and a predictive model for MSPE was generated. RESULTS: Of 41 ODS, 22 infectious CRSsNP, and 13 noninfectious CRSwNP patients, mean age was 57.0 years and 55.3% were female. There was almost perfect agreement between rhinologists when assessing for MSPE on endoscopic images (κ = 0.927). MSPE was seen in 100% of ODS, 22.7% infectious CRSsNP, and 0% CRSwNP. MSPE was significantly more likely in ODS compared to non-odontogenic CRS (p &lt; 0.0001), demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 89.1% specificity for ODS, with 85.7% positive and 100% negative predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: MSPE is a distinct finding that is reliably identifiable and is significantly more likely in ODS compared to infectious CRSsNP and noninfectious CRSwNP. With 100% sensitivity and NPV, MSPE absence makes ODS very unlikely. With 86% PPV, MSPE is not pathognomonic for ODS, but should arouse suspicion for a possible odontogenic source.</description>

Use of effective contraception has been proven to reduce the likelihood of a subsequent unplanned pregnancy, but there are limited data on contraceptive choices, and other socio-demographic factors among women across various districts in Malaysia who have had an unplanned pregnancy. AIM: We investigated factors associated with a history of unplanned pregnancy, and intention to become pregnant in the near future, among reproductively aged women in Malaysia. STUDY SETTING AND METHODOLOGY: Retrospective study based on data collected from the Mothers and Infants in SEACO (South East Asian Community Observatory) Segamat Project (MISS-P) between 2013 and 2021. Women who were known to have given birth were approached by trained data collectors within 0-16 weeks after childbirth. Multivariable backward stepwise logistic regression was used to assess socio-demographic factors associated with unplanned pregnancy and pregnancy spacing with a p value significance level of &lt;0.05. A total of 4278 Malaysian postpartum mothers completed a survey, with a range of measures, including sociodemographic questions and contraceptive behaviours. RESULTS: Approximately 29% of women aged 15 to 47 had a history of unplanned pregnancy and 41% reported not currently using any type of contraception. Around 94% of women reported not having ready access to contraception. The most commonly used method of contraception was the oral contraceptive pill. Being older than 25 years was associated with a reduced likelihood of a history of unplanned pregnancy, while not currently using contraception was associated with a greater likelihood of having had a previous unplanned pregnancy. Women using long acting reversible contraception and the contraceptive injection were less likely to be planning a pregnancy in the near future (&lt; 3 years). CONCLUSIONS: There is low contraceptive use in this sample, particularly among women who have had a history of unplanned pregnancy, with lack of access to contraception cited as the main driver. Mothers, as well as young women, in Malaysia may benefit from health promotion activities to further inform contraceptive counselling interventions to reduce the risk of subsequent unplanned pregnancies and improve pregnancy planning.</description>

This study aims to evaluate the differences in efficacy and survival outcomes between NAC and AC in PSCC patients with lymph node metastasis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of penile cancer patients treated at Peking University Cancer Hospital between May 2015 and December 2023. All patients had lymph node metastasis and underwent lymph node dissection. 11 patients received NAC, while 14 received AC. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression models were used to analyze baseline characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and associated risk factors. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics of patients between the two groups. In the NAC group, 4 patients achieved partial response (PR), 1 achieved complete response (CR), 4 achieved progression disease (PD), and 2 had stable disease (SD). After a median follow-up of 65.1 months, the NAC group had a shorter PFS compared to the AC group (P = 0.029), while no significant difference was observed in OS (P = 0.268). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the presence of cM stage as an independent predictor of both PFS and OS. CONCLUSION: Penile cancer with lymph node metastasis typically carries a dismal prognosis. NAC substantially diminishes tumor size and facilitates surgical excision, whereas AC is more effective in controlling postoperative tumor progression. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment strategies.</description>

Photobiomodulation (PBM) using low-level diode lasers has been proposed to accelerate nerve recovery. PURPOSE: The purpose of study was to compare midface sensory recovery and subject satisfaction between PBM with an 810-nm diode laser and a control side (inactive probe) following Le Fort I osteotomy. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: A prospective triple-blind, split-face randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2021 to 2022 at 2 tertiary hospitals in Tehran. Eligible participants aged 18-40 years who underwent bimaxillary surgery with Le Fort I osteotomy. Exclusion criteria included trauma history, oral diseases, uncontrolled systemic diseases, and contraindications to laser therapy. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the PBM treatment (810-nm GaAlAs diode laser). Treatments were randomly assigned to 1 side of the midface (PBM) while the contralateral side served as the control (inactive probe). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was time to functional sensory recovery (FSR), defined as Medical Research Council Scale S3+. It was measured using a composite of standardized neurosensory tests (2-point discrimination, brush stroke directional, and thermal and sharp/blunt discrimination). Secondary outcomes included subject satisfaction, measured with a 10-point visual analog scale. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, and time since surgery. ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, repeated-measures ANOVA, and Mann-Whitney U tests were used. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The study included 15 subjects (mean age 29.3 ± 7.0 years), with a 35-day follow-up. Median time to FSR was 28 days (interquartile range: 24-32) for the upper lip and 35 days (interquartile range: 30-40) for the nasolabial fold, with no statistically significant differences between PBM and control sides (Log-rank P &gt; .05). Sensory function improved statistically significantly over time, but recovery trajectories did not differ between sides. Subject satisfaction was similar between groups. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Postoperative PBM at 810 nm did not statistically significantly accelerate FSR compared to the control side. However, it was safe and associated with improved subject satisfaction at the final follow-up, suggesting a potential role in enhancing the subjective postoperative experience.</description>

METHODS: This study benchmarked five object detectors including two You Only Look Once models (YOLOv5, YOLOv), Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Faster R-CNN), Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Real-time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR) on WLI dataset using harmonized training (from scratch, 150 epochs, identical hyperparameters) and two label configurations: a 4-label as major categories (SCC, Dysplasia, Bleeding, Inflammation) and an 11-label artifact. Evaluation used macro precision/recall/F1 at IoU 0.50 on a fixed 310-image test set. RESULTS: Incorporating artifact classes improved overall macro metrics, with YOLOv5/YOLOv8 providing the strongest performance in the 11-label scenarios, however, class-wise findings revealed persistent recall limitations for early disease. In the 11-label analysis, Dysplasia detection remained low (YOLOv5: 88/201, 43.8%; YOLOv8: 82/201, 40.8%), and SCC was only moderate (YOLOv5: 25/44, 56.8%; YOLOv8: 24/44, 54.5%). Confusion analyses showed that errors were dominated by non-detections ("background") rather than misclassification with benign or artifact labels, while approximately one in five lesion predictions was a spurious unmatched false positive, implicating both sensitivity and specificity constraints. DISCUSSION: These results indicate that labeling artifacts reduces non-lesion confusion but does not, by itself, recover subtle early lesions. Limitations include single-center, WLI-only data and training from scratch, future work should prioritize endoscopy-specific pretraining, explicit artifact suppression or joint segmentation, and external validation.</description>

We demonstrated before that CD26 inhibition decreases lung tumor growth in experimental models. Here, we analyzed the prognostic significance of CD26 expression and its correlation with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in a large series of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: NSCLC samples from operated patients were analyzed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the expression of CD26 and EMT markers. CD26 was scored semi-quantitatively employing tissue microarrays. Lung cancer cell lines [H460, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC)] were tested for EMT markers, and a colony formation assay was used to test the effect of treatment with the CD26 inhibitor vildagliptin. RESULTS: Tumor samples from 904 patients with NSCLC were analyzed. CD26 IHC expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinoma compared to squamous cell carcinoma (p &lt; 0.0001). Patients with adenocarcinoma and CD26 expression had a better overall survival than patients without CD26 expression. The lack of CD26 expression was shown to be an independent risk factor for worse survival. CD26-expressing adenocarcinomas showed a higher expression of Vimentin and Elastin (p = 0.0027 and p &lt; 0.0001, respectively), while E-cadherin expression was lower in this group of patients (p = 0.0021). In vitro, treatment with vildagliptin reduced the expression of Vimentin and the capacity for colony formation in H460 and LLC cell lines. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: The correlation of CD26 expression in lung adenocarcinomas and better patient survival, the antiproliferative effect on tumor cells by CD26 inhibition, and an altered EMT status give rise to the hypothesis that CD26 inhibitors impact the biology and clinical course of lung adenocarcinomas.</description>

Management of ESCC depends on the resectability of the disease, certain patient characteristics, fitness for surgery, and the anatomic complexity of the disease location. Treatment options include either Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCR) followed by surgery or definitive Chemoradiation (DCR). While randomized trials have provided insights into both strategies, no large-scale retrospective real-world studies have been conducted to compare these approaches in diverse, unselected populations. This study assesses real-world outcomes of NCR versus DCR using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted using data from the NCDB, focusing on patients with ESCC from 2004 to 2020. Propensity score matching (PSM) (1:1) was utilized. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: N = 386 patients with esophageal cancer, with a median age of 64 years (IQR, 57.0-70.0), were identified. Patients were evenly distributed between the DCR and NCR groups, with a total of N = 193 participants. We further selected patients with ESCC, a total of N = 311 patients. NCR demonstrated a significantly extended overall survival (OS) compared to those who received DCR, with a median of 33.15 months vs. 20.5 months (P-value: 0.0069), respectively. Patients receiving DCR had significantly worse OS compared to patients receiving NCR with HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.81, p=0.0206. Patients with tumors in the thoracic esophagus (C15.3) showed significant survival benefit from surgery (p=0.0070), whereas no benefit was seen for cervical tumors (C15.0), likely due to anatomical complexity and limited sample size. CONCLUSION: NCR followed by surgery, when feasible, offers survival benefits for patients with ESCC, especially for locally advanced tumors in the thoracic esophagus.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective blind study was conducted on anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing tooth extraction. Patients were divided into three groups according to the anticoagulant pharmacokinetics: 20 patients on rivaroxaban once daily; 18 on dabigatran or apixaban twice daily, and 20 on warfarin (control group). Extractions were scheduled during the lowest DOACs plasma concentration: 14 hours after the last rivaroxaban dose; 8 hours after the last dabigatran/apixaban dose; and with INR values between 2.0 and 3.0 in the warfarin group. Patients returned 24 hours after tooth extraction for evaluation of bleeding. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were included in the study, in a total of 84 tooth extractions. No minor or major bleeding occurred in the rivaroxaban group. Two patients in the dabigatran/apixaban group (11.1%) and two in the control group (10%) presented minor bleeding. There was no statistically significant difference in bleeding rates among the groups (P = .324), and no major bleeding events were reported. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that the protocol proposing non-discontinuing DOACs in extractions may be feasible in clinical practice.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yu Y, Wang X, Wang M, Li L, Wei H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JCO precision oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/PO-24-00629'&gt;10.1200/PO-24-00629&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Aug-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41428973/'&gt;41428973&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with poor prognosis. This study aims to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying ESCC metastasis, particularly focusing on the role of the long noncoding RNA LINC00115, its interaction with the KHSRP protein, and the activation of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression levels of LINC00115 were analyzed in 96 paired ESCC tumor and adjacent normal tissues using RT-qPCR. In vitro assays, including CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, Transwell migration, and invasion assays, were performed on ESCC cell lines to assess the functional impact of LINC00115. In vivo experiments were conducted using nude mouse models to evaluate the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of LINC00115. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays were used to identify and validate LINC00115 interaction partners. The involvement of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway was confirmed through qPCR and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: LINC00115 was found to be upregulated in ESCC tissues and associated with advanced TNM staging and lymph node metastasis. Its silencing appeared to suppress ESCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and reduce tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC00115 may interact with KHSRP in the cytoplasm and potentially activate the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway involved in ESCC progression. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that LINC00115 may promote ESCC progression via the JAK1/STAT3 pathway through KHSRP interaction. Further validation is needed, and it should be considered a candidate marker rather than a therapeutic target.</description>

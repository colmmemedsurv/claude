      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen L, Zhai S, Liu Y, Gong W, Fang F, Wu Q, Cui Y, Zhang W, Li H, Li Y, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-68108-2'&gt;10.1038/s41467-025-68108-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41501032/'&gt;41501032&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Postoperative recurrence significantly impacts long-term survival in patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04834986), 27 patients with resectable HCC at high recurrence risk received perioperative tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) plus lenvatinib (multi-kinase inhibitor). Co-primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), median DFS, and pathologic complete response (pCR). Post-hoc exploratory machine learning analyses identified potential predictive factors. The regimen was feasible and generally well tolerated; grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7.4%. ORR was 55.6%. Among 20 patients undergoing surgery, The Median DFS was 18.8 months (20.1-month follow-up), with 1- and 2-year DFS of 74.0% and 49.8%, and 20% achieved pCR. No unexpected safety signals were observed. The post-hoc machine learning model based on Tabular Prior Data Fitted Network, comprising six pretreatment hematological measures, demonstrated classification of candidate selection in the training set (area under the curve [AUC], accuracy [ACC], and average precision [AP], all 1.0) and the test set (AUC = 0.917, ACC = 0.778, AP = 0.966). In conclusion, tislelizumab-lenvatinib is a potential perioperative regimen for resectable HCC at high recurrence risk, showing preliminary efficacy and safety.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Okui J, Matsuda S, Nagashima K, Sato Y, Kawakubo H, Ruhstaller T, Thuss-Patience P, Nilsson M, Klevebro F, Tan L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of the National Cancer Institute | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1093/jnci/djaf347'&gt;10.1093/jnci/djaf347&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41500250/'&gt;41500250&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Most recurrences after curative surgery for esophageal cancer occur within 2 years. Conventional recurrence-free survival (RFS), calculated from the time of surgery, may underestimate prognosis for patients who remain recurrence-free during the early postoperative years. This study aimed to evaluate conditional RFS and recurrence timing to inform individualized follow-up strategies. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) analysis was conducted using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative treatments for resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Conditional RFS, defined as the probability of remaining recurrence-free for an additional y years given x years already survived without recurrence (RFSy|RFSx), was estimated. RESULTS: IPD from 10 phase III and 1 phase II RCTs were analyzed (n = 2268 patients with R0 resection). In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), RFS5|RFS0 was 47.9%, which increased to 63.0%, 72.5%, 78.2%, and 81.2% at RFS5|RFS1-4. Among patients who recurred, 58.8% of pN-positive cases recurred within 1 year and 81.7% within 2 years, compared with 42.8% and 69.9% in pN0. At baseline (RFS5|RFS0), patients with pN-positive disease or pM1 disease had worse 5-year RFS than those with pN0 or pM0 disease. However, among patients who remained recurrence-free for 4 years after surgery (RFS5|RFS4), the pattern was reversed, with advanced groups showing better subsequent 5-year RFS. Similar trends were observed in adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Conditional RFS improves over time, particularly in advanced-stage esophageal cancer. Although advanced cases are typically monitored more intensively, findings suggest comparable follow-up intensity may be appropriate once patients remain recurrence-free for a certain postoperative period.</description>

Here we report the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04065672) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) in BS patients. 60 participants with active oral ulcers are randomly assigned to receive LD-IL-2 or placebo. The primary endpoint is the oral ulcer count at week 12. The LD-IL-2 group has significantly fewer oral ulcers than the placebo group (0.69 ± 1.05 vs. 1.57 ± 0.90, P = 0.001) with greater improvements in ulcer pain, disease activity, and quality of life. No infections or severe adverse events are observed in either group. LD-IL-2 expands regulatory T (Treg) cells and decreased the ratio of effector T cell to Treg cells. Thus, LD-IL-2 therapy might be an effective and safe treatment in BS patients and is associated with the modulation of CD4 + T cell populations.</description>

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ecnoglutide in adults with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or with a single oral hypoglycaemic agent. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline at week 24. Between 29 December 2022 and 12 June 2024, 211 participants from 32 medical centres in China were randomised (2:2:1:1) to receive double-blind, once-weekly ecnoglutide (0.6 mg [n = 69] or 1.2 mg [n = 71]) or volume-matched placebo (0.6 mg [n = 36] or 1.2 mg [n = 35]) for 24 weeks. The randomisation, stratified by baseline HbA1c (≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%), was conducted via an interactive web response system. Ecnoglutide and placebo were identical in appearance to achieve masking. The trial was completed. All randomised participants received ≥1 dose of the assigned treatment and thus were included for analyses. At week 24, the least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -1.96% (95% CI -2.18 to -1.73) with ecnoglutide 0.6 mg and -2.43% (95% CI -2.65 to -2.20) with ecnoglutide 1.2 mg versus -0.87% (-1.09 to -0.65) with placebo. The estimated treatment differences versus placebo were -1.09% (95% CI -1.40 to -0.77; p = 0.0003) with ecnoglutide 0.6 mg and -1.56% (95% CI -1.87 to -1.24; p &lt; 0.0001) with ecnoglutide 1.2 mg. Ecnoglutide represents a potential monotherapy option for T2DM. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the registration number NCT05680155.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Morris VK, Ciombor KK, Xiao L, Ochieng JK, Marmonti E, Polite B, Weinberg BA, Krauss JC, Hays J, Mukherjee S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00929'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00929&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41499716/'&gt;41499716&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: In the previously completed NCI9673 (part A) single-arm study, the antiprogrammed death (PD)-ligand-1 antibody nivolumab demonstrated efficacy for patients with metastatic anal cancer. In NCI9673 (Part B), we evaluated the anticytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab for patients with incurable anal cancer. METHODS: In this phase II NCI ETCTN trial, 100 patients with refractory, incurable anal cancer were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab (480 mg IV once every 4 weeks) alone or with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV once every 8 weeks). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included radiographic response, overall survival (OS), and grade ≥3 adverse events. A log-rank test was used to compare survival between arms, with a one-sided alpha of 0.1 and power of 90%. Immune biomarkers were analyzed from baseline and on treatment tissue and blood collections. RESULTS: The median PFS for nivolumab versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab were 2.9 months (90% CI, 1.9 to 3.8) and 3.7 months (90% CI, 2.0 to 5.6), respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.23]; P = .25). Response rates were similar for nivolumab (17.4%) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab (21.5%; P = .89). The median OS was 15.9 months for nivolumab and 20.0 months for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (HR, 0.98 [90% CI, 0.63 to 1.51]). Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 6 patients (12%) receiving nivolumab alone and in 12 patients (25%) receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab. At week 9, circulating TIGIT+ CD8+ cells (P &lt; .001) increased with nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment relative to baseline. CONCLUSION: The addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab did not statistically improve overall response rate, PFS, or OS but may harbor increased toxicity. Paired blood samples identified TIGIT expression on peripheral T cells as a compensatory change unique to dual PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade.</description>

This study aims to describe our standardized VANS procedure for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and to evaluate its safety and surgical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed six patients with PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy using the VANS approach at our institution between January 2022 and December 2024. All patients were diagnosed preoperatively by an endocrinologist. Tumor localization was assessed using computed tomography, ultrasonography, and Tc-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile scintigraphy. Surgical techniques, operative outcomes, and perioperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: VANS was successfully performed in all six patients, including one upper and five lower parathyroid gland lesions. Tumor size ranged from 7 to 23 mm (median, 18 mm). Operative time ranged from 60 to 177 minutes (median, 116.5 minutes), with minimal blood loss. Intraoperative ultrasonography was useful for tumor identification in selected cases. Complete adenoma resection was achieved in all patients without complications or conversion to open surgery. CONCLUSION: VANS is a safe, effective, and cosmetically favorable surgical option for selected patients with PHPT. With appropriate patient selection and standardized techniques, this approach can be reproducibly performed in centers experienced in endoscopic neck surgery.</description>

RLN injuries are common in this zone during thyroidectomy. This study aims to describe the vascular pattern at the modified P1 zone. METHODS: This prospective analysis included 131 consecutive subjects who underwent thyroid surgery between October 2023 and June 2024. Various clinical, radiological, histopathological and intraoperative parameters were studied. RESULTS: The study included 212 nerves at risk(NAR). The mean age of the study population was 43 ± 12.6 years. Immediate post-operative vocal cord palsy was noted in 3.3% of NAR. 100% of patients had at least one vessel in relation to RLN in the modified P1 zone. The mean number of vessels in this zone was 3 ± 1.2. Type 3 vascular pattern(presence of vessels anterior and posterior to the nerve) was the most common(68.9%). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of Pelizzo grade 2 tubercle of Zuckerkandl (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.07-5.37, p = 0.033) and the presence of stage 2 or 3 tumor stage(OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.10- 4.55, p = 0.026) were independent predictors of the increased number of vessels(&gt; 2 vessels). CONCLUSION: The study describes the consistent vascular pattern and its relationship with RLN in the modified P1 zone. Awareness of this may help surgeons to prevent RLN injury during thyroid surgery and effectively tackle the vessels in modified P1 zone.</description>

METHODS: Forty-four patients received two cycles of induction therapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin/nedaplatin combined with a PD-1 inhibitor), followed by concurrent radiotherapy with two additional cycles of chemoimmunotherapy and subsequent immune maintenance therapy for up to one year. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: At the data cut-off point (median follow-up: 25.5 months), both the ORR and DCR were 95.5%. The median PFS was 26 months (95% CI: 14.8-37.2), and the median OS was 29 months (95% CI: 23.0-35.0). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 75.0%, 51.9%, and 40.4%, respectively, and the OS rates were 81.8%, 63.1%, and 42.0%, respectively. Distant metastasis represented the main failure mode (64.0%). Treatment-related adverse events were generally mild; moreover, 17 patients (38.6%) experienced grade ≥3 events, primarily involving hematologic toxicity (14/17). Severe immune-related adverse events were rarely observed. QoL assessment in surviving patients (n = 21) indicated favorable overall function and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and maintenance immunotherapy demonstrated promising survival outcomes, a manageable safety profile, and a preserved QoL, thereby offering a viable nonsurgical alternative for patients with locally advanced ESCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Boralevi F, Simon G, Bernigaud C, Brun J, Goujon E, Perrot JL, Phan A, Hérissé AL, Maruani A, Vanhaecke C, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2025-086277'&gt;10.1136/bmj-2025-086277&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41494769/'&gt;41494769&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oral ivermectin or topical 5% permethrin can clinically cure scabies in index cases and in members of their households. DESIGN: Multicentre, assessor blinded, cluster randomised clinical trial. SETTING: 28 French hospitals, 19 January 2016 to 16 December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Index cases; adults and children weighing &gt;15 kg with scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: Index cases were randomly assigned to the ivermectin group or permethrin group (1:1 ratio). Each member of the cluster, defined as the household of each index case, received the same treatment as the index case, except for children weighing &lt;15 kg who were prescribed topical 5% permethrin. All participants received oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg or 5% permethrin cream on day 0 and day 10. Permethrin cream was applied to the whole body, from head to toe. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was clinical cure of the cluster on day 28 (ie, disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of scabies for all cluster members). Secondary outcomes were index case and individual level analyses and safety. Dermatologists were used as assessors and were masked to the treatment. RESULTS: 507 participants in 142 households (clusters) were treated with ivermectin and 568 participants in 147 households received permethrin. Cluster level cure rates were 71.8% versus 88.5% (-16.7 percentage point difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -7.1) for ivermectin versus permethrin. Secondary outcome percentage point differences also showed the inferiority of ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin for index cases (76.6% v 91.5%; percentage point difference -14.9, 95% CI -23.6 to -6.2) and participants (85.3% v 94.2%; -9.2 percentage point difference, -14.9 to -3.5). Intraclass correlation coefficients were higher for permethrin than ivermectin for all clusters (0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75 v 0.46, 0.37 to 0.56) and for cluster size &gt;1 (0.67, 0.60 to 0.74 v 0.47, 0.37 to 0.56). Cutaneous adverse events were found in 11.9% and 15.6% of participants treated with ivermectin and permethrin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this cluster randomised trial of classic scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy, did not show the non-inferiority of oral ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin cream, given on days 0 and 10, in achieving clinical cure of scabies on day 28 in index cases and their household members. Conversely, the trial showed the statistical superiority of 5% permethrin cream. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02407782.</description>

FAP is typically characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the colon and rectum, with a nearly 100% chance of developing CRC if left untreated. Duodenal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer for patients with FAP; however, gastric cancer has become more prevalent in recent years with improved surveillance of the colon, rectum, and duodenum. Patients frequently develop other extracolonic manifestations including desmoid disease, which holds the highest extracolonic mortality risk, and thyroid nodules, which are more frequently associated with the cribriform morular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. Management of FAP is complex, and patients require frequent and lifelong surveillance. This review will discuss the current understanding and clinical management of FAP as well as innovations and challenges in clinical practice.</description>

It primarily inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells by interfering with DNA replication and transcription. CHOP has been approved for the treatment of various types of malignant tumors. The aim of this research is to assess adverse events linked to CHOP using real-world data. METHODS: This research collected and analyzed adverse event reports associated with CHOP from the FAERS(US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) database spanning from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2024. This study leveraged the FAERS database, extracting reports submitted exclusively by healthcare professionals where CHOP was designated as the primary suspect (PS). Four risk signal detection methods were employed: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multiitem Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to conduct a comprehensive analysis of CHOP-related ADRs. RESULTS: A total of 3,625 adverse event reports with CHOP as the primary suspect drug were obtained. Across 25 system organ classes (SOCs), four positive Preferred Terms(PTs) signals were detected. The most significant signal in SOCs was "blood and lymphatic system disorders" (ROR = 6.64, 95% CI 6.49-6.79), while the most significant PTs signal was "high grade B-cell lymphoma Burkitt-like lymphoma recurrent" (ROR = 613.63, 95% CI 123.85-3040.40). CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence of the presence of CHOP seven unexpected off-label AEs were also observed, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, hypotelorism of orbit, breakthrough COVID-19, airway remodeling, meningitis enteroviral, acute graft versus host disease, and gastrosplenic fistula. Additionally, the combination of CHOP and radiotherapy increased the risk of several severe AEs, such as hemorrhagic cystitis. These findings highlight the importance of caution when prescribing CHOP to high-risk individuals with a history of meningitis, cystitis or airway obstruction.</description>

Our goal was to develop and validate a new, short patient-reported outcome measure to screen for barriers to daily oral ART adherence in HIV care in Canada and France. The overarching design was that of a multi-phase, multi-site instrument development project. It involved a previously published qualitative research synthesis (to develop a conceptual framework from which to generate items). Here, we present the results of cognitive interviews (for content validity testing of the preliminary items) and of a longitudinal survey-based study where the revised 7-item instrument (the I-Score) was administered at two timepoints (baseline, 4 weeks), along with five indirect measures of ART adherence, including self-reported HIV viral load and, for a subset of Montreal participants, plasma viral load. The survey data was used to analyze the instrument's measurement properties, namely structural validity (e.g., with Pearson inter-item correlations); construct validity, including cross-cultural validity, for a variety of sociodemographic groups (with receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses and areas under the curve (AUC); reliability (with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)); and measurement error (with the standard error of measurement (SEM)). Study participants were adults living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy recruited from hospital-based infectious disease centers and community-based organizations in Montreal, Toronto, and Paris. The qualitative synthesis of 41 studies led to a framework composed of 6 barrier domains. One item was generated per domain. The 6-item measure was submitted to cognitive testing with 12 adults living with HIV, leading to several changes, including the division of one item into two, creating a 7-item measure. Overall, 305 adults living with HIV participated in the survey. Inter-item correlations were low to moderate, suggesting no redundant items. Among conclusive results, AUC's were all above the predefined threshold (≥ 0.70) for self-reported viral load and plasma viral load for the global sample and across all subgroups examined. The ICC, at 0.81, was also above the predefined threshold (≥ 0.70). The SEM was 0.43. Overall, the evidence generated supports the 7-item I-Score measure's content validity, construct validity/cross-cultural validity, reliability, and acceptable measurement error, in its specified context of use.</description>

Key oncogenic viruses that cause solid tumors include high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by boosting immune responses against tumors. While viral infection-associated tumors often exhibit "hot" immune profiles, clinical outcomes with ICIs remain inconsistent. Some studies report improved survival in virus-associated cancers, whereas others indicate no clear benefit, which might reflect high variability in tumor microenvironments and immune responses. In this review, we aim to explore the direct and indirect contribution of different viruses to carcinogenesis in solid tumors, with a particular focus on immunotherapy effectiveness based on infection status.</description>

This study explores the relationship between PM2.5 exposure, the oral microbiome, and metabolic biomarkers including ghrelin, resistin, and insulin. METHODS: Data from 473 adult participants (97.7% Black; median age: 53.6) were analyzed. PM2.5 exposure was retrospectively assigned based on residential addresses, metabolic biomarkers were measured from blood samples, and oral microbiome profiles were obtained from saliva samples. Multivariate linear regression, weighted quantile sum regression, and high-dimensional mediation analysis were employed to estimate microbiome-biomarker associations, the association of the oral microbiome mixture, and mediation effects for PM2.5 exposure. RESULTS: A total of 20 oral microbiome taxa were significantly associated with at least one biomarker, with genus Atopobium linked to all three. Insulin demonstrated the strongest sensitivity to the oral microbiome influence. Genera in phyla Actinomycetota and Bacillota played key roles in the relationship between the oral microbiome and metabolic biomarkers. Mediation analysis revealed that the oral microbiome mediated 16.5% and 11.1% of PM2.5's associations with resistin and insulin, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests potential mechanisms regarding how the oral microbiome influences metabolic biomarkers and mediates the metabolic effects of PM2.5 exposure.</description>

Branaplam, an orally available HTT messenger RNA splicing modulator, reduces HTT protein levels in vitro and in animal models, and is the first splicing modulator to be evaluated in individuals with HD. Here we present the design and results of VIBRANT-HD, a randomized phase 2b study of branaplam in HD, along with preclinical findings in nonhuman primates. VIBRANT-HD utilized an innovative study design informed by our preclinical data, including targeted safety monitoring measures (for example, neurofilament light chain measurements in blood, nerve conduction studies), and staggered cohorts to capture potential neurotoxic effects early. Of the 21 participants in the initial cohort receiving branaplam 56 mg weekly, 18 (85.7%) showed at least one sign or symptom of peripheral neuropathy. This safety signal, along with dose-modeling results triggered the early termination of VIBRANT-HD. The primary outcome, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid mutant HTT levels versus placebo, was summarized descriptively, making branaplam the first splicing modulator to lower mutant HTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with HD. Increased neurofilament light chain levels observed in most participants reversed after treatment discontinuation. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05111249.</description>

Although 86.7% (26/30) of patients with recurrent CDI did not experience a subsequent recurrence over 8 weeks in an open-label phase 1b study, a subsequent double-blind phase 2 study ( NCT02437487 ) did not demonstrate a significant benefit over placebo (rate of recurrence at 8 weeks in SER-109 versus placebo: 44.1% versus 53.3%). These discordant outcomes were hypothesized to be due to suboptimal dosing. This hypothesis was addressed in a pivotal phase 3 trial ( NCT03183128 ) using an approximately tenfold higher dose. In phase 3, only 12% of VOS-treated patients versus 40% of placebo patients recurred by week 8 (relative risk 0.32, P &lt; 0.001). Here in this follow-up post hoc analysis, across-trial comparisons confirmed that the higher, efficacious phase 3 dose is associated with improved pharmacokinetics, assessed by VOS engraftment (patients with available samples: phase 1b: 28, phase 2: 79, phase 3: 170). In-depth phase 3 analyses revealed that VOS significantly altered microbial composition, significantly enriching the diversity and abundance of Firmicutes species and reducing the prevalence and abundance of C. difficile and opportunistic pathogens (for example, Enterobacteriaceae species). Consistent with these taxonomic changes, significant changes in key bioactive metabolites were observed, including depletion of conjugated and deconjugated primary bile acids, enrichment of secondary bile acids and increases in short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. In vitro, VOS batches produced these C. difficile-inhibiting metabolites. These findings on the pharmacology of VOS underscore the importance of rapidly restoring key protective functions of the microbiome in patients with recurrent CDI to achieve durable prevention of recurrence, as observed in the phase 3 study; they also highlight the need to include the microbiome in the clinical management of CDI.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Schwarz S, Kummer S, Klang A, Walter I, Nell B, Brandt S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328584'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0328584&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490689/'&gt;41490689&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant tumor disease in horses. It predominantly affects the ocular, oronasal, and anogenital region. Equine SCC is difficult to treat, also because important aspects of SCC development and metastasis are still unclear. We previously provided evidence that equine SCC cells can adopt a stem cell-like phenotype as a hallmark of malignant progression. Here, we investigated whether equine SCCs harbor endothelial-like tumor cells that form an alternative network of pseudo-vessels better known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Following histopathological diagnosis, 43 equine SCCs or precursor lesions (15 ocular, 14 genital, 14 oronasal tumors) were PCR-screened for equine papillomavirus (EcPV) infection. Subsequently, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-sections of all tumors were analyzed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for endothelial cell marker CD31. Obtained micrographs were evaluated by a scientific board to unanimously identify sections of intact tumor tissue displaying PAS-positive, CD31-negative lumens harboring erythrocytes. Thirteen lesions exhibiting these features were subjected to triple immunofluorescence (IF) staining for CD31, pan-cytokeratin (KRT) and type 4 collagen (Col4) or alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) to confirm the presence of VM, and to determine whether pericytes have a role in this phenomenon. All genital and 50% of oronasal lesions scored positive for EcPV type 2, whilst ocular lesions tested negative. One mandibular SCC harbored EcPV type 5. Six genital, three oronasal, and four ocular tumors unambiguously exhibited VM as revealed by CD31-/PAS+ vessel-like structures containing erythrocytes, the detection of CD31-negative cells lining their lumens, and the presence of Col4 and αSMA in this lining. Detection of these two proteins in the context of VM suggests that VM-forming cancer cells recruit pericytes to enhance channel formation and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence of VM in equine cancer, and more generally, SCC in animals.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhou Y, Wang B, Song C, Xie W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335395'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0335395&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490177/'&gt;41490177&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) remains a significant challenge in oncology due to limited diagnostic and therapeutic options. Epigenetic regulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) play crucial roles in cancer pathogenesis, progression, and immune evasion, making them valuable areas of investigation for understanding LUSC. METHODS: This study integrated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to identify differentially expressed epigenetics and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (EERSGs) in LUSC. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed, and various machine learning and Cox models were employed to filter characteristic and prognostic markers. Further investigations included single-gene analysis, pan-cancer exploration, validation using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, drug sensitivity analysis, and experimental validation through knockdown models, Western Blot, CCK-8, and Transwell experiments. RESULTS: Our analysis identified ACE and HSPB8 as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in LUSC. A risk scoring system was developed, accurately predicting patient survival outcomes. Low expression groups were associated with decreased immune escape potential, indicating higher efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Quantitative analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and functional assays revealed significant differences in the roles of ACE and HSPB8 between normal lung and LUSC cells, underscoring their importance in tumor biology and epigenetic regulation. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive bioinformatics and experimental study highlights ACE and HSPB8 as novel targets for LUSC treatment and prognosis, emphasizing their roles in epigenetic regulation and ERS. The risk model demonstrates preliminary potential for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and ERS in cancer development and treatment. Thus, our findings open avenues for further research into targeted therapies for LUSC, aiming to improve patient outcomes through precision medicine that considers both epigenetic factors and ERS.</description>

METHODS: A home pharmaceutical care service team was constituted by pharmacists and physicians from the county-level medical community. A home-based pharmaceutical care survey was conducted for patients with long-term oral anticoagulants (VKAs, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban). The patients' awareness and adherence score to oral anticoagulants(OATs) was evaluated before and after home pharmaceutical care service. The awareness and adherence score were evaluated with awareness questionnaires and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8), respectively. The paired-sample t tests were used to compare the awareness and adherence score. RESULTS: Finally, totally 95 patients completed the survey. Among these patients, 29 patients were in the VKAs group and 66 patients were in the NOACs group. Following the implementation of home pharmaceutical care service, there was an increase in the awareness score, rising from 5.02 ± 1.71 to 8.09 ± 1.25 (p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the adherence score increased from 4.66 ± 1.66 to 6.94 ± 0.59 (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that the home pharmaceutical care service model implemented within county-level medical community for anticoagulation treatment is feasible and shows promise in improving anticoagulation knowledge and medication adherence among patients.The findings provide preliminary evidence for a service model that could be further evaluated. Future controlled studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and to investigate its impact on clinical health outcomes.</description>

METHODS: Patients with UVFP (n = 54), VF lesions (n = 42), and HVF (n = 41) were retrospectively identified. Image frames and voice samples were extracted from stroboscopic videos. Clinicodemographic variables were collected from the electronic health record. Patient-level data was independently divided into training (80%) and testing (20%). Visual features were extracted using a transformer DINOv2 and acoustic features were extracted using Librosa. All three feature modalities were combined using a custom multilayer perceptron. Unimodality models using only image or only voice data were trained for comparison. Accuracy and F1 scores were used to validate the models. RESULTS: On a hold-out test set, the multimodal classifier demonstrated stronger performance (76.9% accuracy) compared to the image classifier (61.5% accuracy) and audio classifier (65.4% accuracy). On an external dataset, the multimodal classifier accuracy dropped to 45%, though still an improvement compared to accuracies of 42% and 31% for the video-only and audio-only modalities, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, we successfully developed a multimodal dataset and classifier for VF pathology, demonstrating the potential of combining stroboscopic frames, voice and text data. The multimodal classifier achieved higher accuracy than the image-only model and audio-only models. Future models should validate these findings on larger datasets.</description>

METHODS: The connector underwent engineering validation in a laboratory and preclinical testing using a porcine model. A handheld standard stimulator probe served as the control. The experimental group consisted of a long monopolar probe and two connector-adapted probes. Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and vagus nerves were stimulated to compare the efficacy and safety of the adapted probes with the standard probe. RESULTS: The connector, when coupled to endoscopic instruments, did not show a statistically significant difference in electromyographic (EMG) amplitude at 1 mA stimulation compared with the standard probe. Safety analysis showed no significant hemodynamic effects. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the developed connector, when paired with endoscopic instruments, enables reliable nerve identification and preservation during endoscopic thyroid surgery, with favorable efficacy and safety profiles.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data are from the Health, Aging and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, which included 1136 older adults who received a periodontal examination and were followed for up to 16 years. Pocket depth and clinical attachment level were assessed for all present teeth. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to examine the relationship between periodontal parameters and number of natural teeth with lung cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS: Lung cancer incidence was 4.4% (n = 50) and was identified as cause of death in 3.3% (n = 38). Those presenting at least 10% of sites with probing depth ≥ 6 mm demonstrated a higher risk of lung cancer and death due to lung cancer (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-6.72 and HR: 3.08, 95% CI: 1.27-7.46), respectively. Tooth loss was associated with a reduced hazard of lung cancer incidence (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93-0.99) and related mortality (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92-0.99). CONCLUSION: The association between severe periodontal disease parameters and tooth loss with lung cancer among older adults underscores the importance of oral health maintenance for cancer prevention strategies.</description>

This study investigates a novel mobile application (app), Speech Recognition Application for the Voice Impaired (SRAVI), to improve postoperative communication for TL patients. Participants received a tutorial on the technology prior to use and had access to the app throughout their hospital admission. A total of 16 patients were included. Of 652 valid transactions within the app, accurate phrase return on the first attempt was 43% with a total accuracy of 67%. Patients used SRAVI primarily to communicate with their care team (66.7%) and with family members/social support (80%). Patients reported using SRAVI, on average, 43.6% of the time to communicate during their hospitalization the majority (69.7%) preferred SRAVI to written communication. In TL patients, use of speech recognition technology is feasible in the immediate postoperative period.</description>

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). REVIEW METHODS: Four reviewers searched five databases for English-language cohort or case-control studies of anterior skull base surgery. Studies were excluded for noneligible comparisons, interventions, populations, or incomplete complication reporting. RESULTS: The search identified 1360 studies. After removing duplicates, 925 titles/abstracts were screened, with 765 excluded. One hundred sixty full-text articles were assessed, and 108 studies (25,462 patients) were included. Pooled random-effects incidence of VTE was 1.4% (95% CI 1.1%-1.7%; prediction interval [PI] 0.3%-6.2%). Individual rates were 1.0% for DVT (95% CI 0.8%-1.2%; PI 0.4%-2.8%) and 1.1% for PE (95% CI 0.8%-1.3%; PI 0.3%-3.6%). Overall bleeding occurred in 2.2% (95% CI 1.8%-2.7%; PI 0.5%-9.5%). VTE rates were highest in Cushing's disease (3.8%, 95% CI 3.0%-4.8%) and malignancy (4.5%, 95% CI 2.9%-7.1%). Expanded approaches generally showed higher complication rates than standard approaches (VTE 3.1% vs 1.5%, bleeding 4.3% vs 2.0%). CONCLUSION: Endonasal skull base surgery is associated with low rates of VTE and bleeding, but between-study heterogeneity is considerable, and event rates may exceed average reported rates in some settings, supporting individualized prophylaxis, particularly for higher-risk pathologies and when using expanded approaches.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kelleter L, Harrabi S, Ochoa-Parra P, Winter M, Jäkel O, Debus J, Martisikova M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.036'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.036&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490579/'&gt;41490579&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Ion-beam radiotherapy offers steep dose gradients and high biological effectiveness required for the treatment of complex cancer cases. While the vast majority of ion-beam therapy centers today use protons and carbon ions, there is renewed interest in helium ions for their unique physical and radiobiological properties. All ion-beam treatments suffer from beam-range uncertainties mainly caused by potential changes of the patient morphology. In-vivo treatment monitoring with secondary ions could potentially provide feedback about the treatment quality that would allow a dose reduction in the healthy tissue or an escalation of the tumor dose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This work presents the first in-vivo monitoring of a helium-ion therapy patient treated for a solitary fibrous tumor. The method is based on the tracking of secondary ions that leave the patient as a natural by-product of ion-beam radiotherapy. RESULTS: The comparison of two measured secondary-ion distributions confirmed a high treatment reproducibility for the reported patient. However, significant differences between the two fractions were detected at the border of the skull base and the sinus sphenoidalis that could originate from potential inter-fractional cavity filling. CONCLUSIONS: The world's first in-vivo monitoring of innovative helium-ion therapy was performed successfully. In the future, the observed signals will need to be validated with patients that receive regular control CTs. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations and phantom measurements will help to establish a robust link between changes in the secondary-ion distribution and clinically relevant dose changes.</description>

This study sought to determine the reproducibility of Daxi results (Phase 2) and safety/results for Daxi dose escalation (Phase 3) in patients who previously had been successfully treated with Daxi. METHODS: Thirteen AdLD patients with consistent benefit from BtxA were enrolled in an open-label prospective clinical trial involving repeat administration and/or up-titration of Daxi dose. Duration of voice benefit (DVB) and safety of dose escalation were primary outcomes. PROMs and voice recordings were obtained pre- and post-injection. RESULTS: Twenty-nine total injections (21 repeat dose, 8 dose escalation) were performed in 13 patients (85% female, mean age = 60.4). No adverse events occurred, and there was no difference in EAT-10 pre- to post-injection (repeated dose p = 0.08, dose escalation p = 0.12). In patients who experienced greater benefit with Daxi, average DVB was 112.75 days, 33.5% longer than their average BtxA duration (mean = 84.2 days, p = 0.003). 54% (7/13) had longer DVB with Daxi, and 46% (6/13) had equivocal DVB compared to BtxA DVB by the end of the study. Daxi DVB was comparable to an earlier study, demonstrating reproducibility of Daxi injection results (p = 0.332, SD = 13.6 days). CONCLUSIONS: Our results were variable but showed reproducible results with Daxi, with overall longer DVB with Daxi in 42.8% of total injections, with an average of 33.5% longer DVB than BtxA in a cohort of known Daxi-responsive patients. Daxi dose escalation did not result in significant dysphagia or adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of Daxi in the treatment of AdLD.</description>

DaxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (Daxi) is a peptide-formulated neuromodulator with reported longer therapeutic duration. This study compared the safety and efficacy of Daxi to historical BtxA results in AdLD patients. METHODS: In this open-label, prospective clinical trial, 22 stable-dose, BtxA-responsive AdLD patients underwent Daxi injection. To optimize safety, the first 10 patients' doses were given in a staged fashion (3-6 days between half doses). Safety and duration of voice benefit (DVB) were the primary outcomes. PROMs and voice analyses were obtained pre- and monthly post-injection. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 20 (75% female, mean age = 58.3) were analyzed, with two excluded for injection "misses." No adverse reactions were reported. EAT-10 showed no difference pre- and post-Daxi injection (p = 0.068). VHI-10 significantly improved (p = 0.004) pre- to post-injection. Procedural LEMG quantitative data for Daxi and BtxA were comparable (p = 0.279). DVB of Daxi was longer than BtxA in 8/20 (40%), equal to BtxA in 7/20 (35%), and shorter than BtxA in 5/19 (25%). Those with Daxi benefit had on average 43.9% (39.5 days) longer therapeutic duration than previous BtxA treatments. Seven patients (35%) returned to BtxA at subsequent injection whereas 13 patients (65%) desired repeat Daxi injection. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first implementation of Daxi for AdLD. Daxi was notably safe and effective. Although no overall significant difference was noted for the entire study cohort, 40% of patients reported substantially longer duration of voice benefit with Daxi than with BtxA, with 43.9% longer duration than their previous BtxA treatments.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; He W, Li Z, Xie Q, Han Y, Peng L, Wang C, Wang K, Liu G, Li H, Zhou Q, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.50307'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.50307&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490111/'&gt;41490111&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The optimal treatment strategy for locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remains controversial. Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery and surgery with adjuvant therapy (AT) are commonly used approaches. OBJECTIVES: To compare the long-term survival outcomes, safety, and pathological benefits of NCRT followed by surgery vs surgery with AT in patients with locally advanced ESCC, and to evaluate the survival impact of pathological complete response (pCR) in the NCRT subgroup. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized, open-label phase 3 trial was conducted at Sichuan Cancer Hospital, China, between January 2018 and April 2020. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years; had histologically confirmed, resectable, locally advanced thoracic ESCC, staged as cT1N+M0 or cT2-4aNxM0; were expected to survive more than 6 months; and had adequate organ function. Key exclusion included prior malignant neoplasms, distant or cervical lymph node metastasis, contraindications to surgery, and prior gastrectomy precluding reconstruction. Data were analyzed April to December 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the NCRT group received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (40 Gy in 20 fractions) with concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by surgery. Patients in the AT group received an adjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen designed by a multidisciplinary team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included disease-free survival (DFS), pathological outcomes, treatment-related toxic effects, and perioperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients were initially enrolled; after exclusions and randomization, 118 patients in the NCRT group (median [IQR] age, 62 [54-66] years; 102 [86.4%] male) and 112 patients in the AT group (median [IQR] age, 63 [55-66] years; 97 [86.6%] male) were included in the analysis. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 59.1 (54.4-65.9) months, there were no significant differences in OS or DFS between the groups. The 5-year OS rates were 59.2% (95% CI, 51.0%-68.8%) for the NCRT group and 59.6% (95% CI, 51.2%-69.5%) for the AT group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.67-1.51; P = .97). The 5-year DFS rates were 53.1% (95% CI, 44.7%-63.1%) and 56.5% (95% CI, 47.9%-66.7%), respectively (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.77-1.68; P = .53). Subgroup analysis showed that patients achieving pCR in the NCRT group had significantly improved survival outcomes, with a 5-year OS rate of 76.5% (95% CI, 63.5%-92.1%) compared with 52.1% (95% CI, 42.4%-64.1%) for non-pCR patients (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.82; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, there were no differences in OS or DFS for patients treated with NCRT followed by surgery or surgery with AT. However, for the patients who achieved pCR with NCRT, there were significant advantages, with markedly improved long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy did not benefit all patients; for those less likely to respond, the combination of surgery with postoperative AT remains a reasonable strategy. These findings show that it may not be appropriate to universally recommend neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for all patients.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liufu Y, Su R, Wen Y, Guan Y, Mahmoud MA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15501-1'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15501-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41485033/'&gt;41485033&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Lung cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The diagnosis of multiple primary lung cancers (MPLCs) has become more frequent due to advanced chest CT technology and improved health surveillance. However, differentiating MPLCs from intrapulmonary metastases (IPMs) and multiple benign pulmonary lesions (MBPLs) remains challenging. OBJECTIVES: Distinguishing multiple primary lung cancers from metastases and benign lesions on CT remains challenging yet critical for treatment planning. Current approaches rely on subjective interpretation and invasive procedures. This study aims to develop and validate an automated deep learning classification system to provide rapid, objective diagnoses for optimizing patient management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 260 patients (MPLC = 83, IPM = 81, MBPL = 96; 881 axial CT slices). Six pretrained architectures (DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B1, MambaOut-Kobe, ResNet-50, SwinV2-CR-Tiny-224, ViT-Tiny-Patch16-224) were compared in a five-seed ablation (seeds 42, 789, 1011, 2025, 2048). Pairwise one-vs-rest DeLong tests were aggregated across seeds to compare AUCs. Clinical utility was assessed using decision curve analysis (DCA). The final model (MambaOut-Kobe) underwent stratified five-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Considering efficiency, MambaOut-Kobe combined competitive accuracy with the lowest memory (~ 100 ± 14 MB) and low latency (~ 0.0093 ± 0.0017 s/image). Aggregated DeLong testing found no significant AUC differences among these models after multiplicity control. On five-fold cross-validation, MambaOut-Kobe achieved a macro-AUC of 0.946 ± 0.004 (95% CI 0.942-0.950), and an accuracy 0.829 ± 0.029 (95% CI 0.800-0.858). DCA demonstrated a positive net benefit across clinically relevant threshold probabilities compared with treat-all and treat-none strategies. Grad-CAM visualizations highlighted diagnostically relevant regions in CT images, providing interpretable decision-making support. CONCLUSIONS: The MambaOut Kobe model demonstrates outstanding potential for clinical application in classifying MPLC, IPM, and MBPL. Its combination of high accuracy and computational efficiency makes it a promising tool for lung cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. This automated approach could reduce diagnostic uncertainty, minimize unnecessary invasive procedures, and facilitate timely, personalized treatment decisions for patients with multiple lung lesions. Future studies should focus on validating the model on larger, multicenter datasets and enhancing its discriminatory capacity between MPLC and IPM.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the association between oral health indicators and CKD in a nationally representative sample of Brazilian adults. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, nationally representative analysis using data from the 2019 Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS), which employed a three-stage stratified cluster sampling design. The outcome was CKD, and the main exposures were self-related oral health, tooth loss, toothbrushing frequency, and eating difficulty due to oral conditions. Multivariable survey-weighted logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, diabetes, and hypertension. RESULTS: The study included 279,382 individuals, representing a weighted population of over 209 million Brazilians. Poor self-rated oral health was associated with higher odds of CKD (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.56-2.97). Complete tooth loss showed a trend toward an association with CKD (adjusted OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.00-1.69; p = 0.050), and oral health-related eating difficulty was associated with higher odds of CKD (adjusted OR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.45-2.93). In contrast, brushing teeth three times per day was associated with lower odds of CKD (adjusted OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.14-0.81). Fewer than half of participants reported visiting a dentist within the past year, and only 22.6% utilized public dental services. CONCLUSION: Oral health conditions, including poor hygiene practices, tooth loss, and eating difficulties are significantly associated with CKD. These findings highlight the need to integrate oral health into chronic disease prevention strategies, particularly within public health systems in upper-middle-income countries.</description>

However, some cases remain unrelated to HPV infections. Current HPV screening methods have difficulties identifying HPV-negative patients and implementing them in low-resource settings. Therefore, it is important to explore easily accessible and low-cost biomarkers to optimize the current cervical cancer screening strategies. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6998 women from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), among whom 147 had self-reported cervical cancer. Serum γ - Glutamyltransferase (GGT) was employed as a continuous variable (naturally logarithmically transformed) and a categorical variable (≥50 U/L versus &lt;50 U/L), and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to progressively adjust for demographic features, sexual history, and clinical behaviors. The restricted cubic spline approach was adopted to further explore the dose-response relationship between GGT levels and cervical cancer to depict the potential nonlinear trends between them in a more elaborate manner. We also conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses to ensure reliability of our results. This included multiple imputation of missing data and adjustment for crucial covariates, such as body mass index (BMI) and tobacco exposure, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of different factors on the outcomes. Ultimately, through mediation analysis, we probed the mediating function of tobacco exposure in the association between GGT levels and cervical cancer, aiming to obtain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this health-related relationship. RESULTS: Serum GGT levels are positively correlated with cervical cancer risk. For each log unit increase in GGT levels, there was a 31% increased risk of cervical cancer (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.01-1.70, P = 0.041) in the model adjusted for multiple risk factors. When the GGT level reached or exceeded 50 U/L, the risk increased by 76% (OR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.04-2.98, P = 0.034). This tendency was consistent across several crucial subgroups, particularly among HPV-negative women (OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.01-1.84), suggesting that GGT may have some significance in different populations. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the main findings remained robust, even when multiple imputations were employed to handle missing data. Nevertheless, the significant association between GGT and cervical cancer weakened when tobacco exposure was further adjusted, indicating that tobacco use might be involved. Mediation analysis further showed that the overall impact of GGT on cervical cancer was statistically significant (β = 0.0014; 95%CI: 0.0001-0.0020; P = 0.046), and approximately 18.15% of the impact was accounted for by tobacco exposure (ACME: β = 0.0003, 95%CI: 0.0001-0.0004, P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a partial mediating role. CONCLUSION: Elevated serum GGT levels are associated with a heightened risk of cervical cancer even in HPV-negative patients. Although this association is partly mediated by tobacco exposure, GGT may still play a role in cervical cancer via nontobacco routes. The potential application of GGT as an auxiliary biomarker requires further validation in prospective studies.</description>

METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial conducted at Liaocheng People's Hospital (2023-2024), 80 STEMI patients undergoing emergency PCI were randomized to: Treatment group: Single subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg plus oral rosuvastatin 10 mg administered pre-PCI, followed by rosuvastatin 10 mg/day; Control group: Rosuvastatin 10 mg/day alone initiated post-PCI. Primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included angina incidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, interleukins, and ST-segment resolution rate (STR). The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2500099498). RESULTS: Primary endpoint (MACEs): 5.0% (treatment group) vs. 12.5% (control group)(P = 0.228) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints: Angina incidence: 7.5% vs 27.5% (P = 0.037) at 6-month follow-up; LDL-C reduction: Significant in treatment group at day 1 (2.97 ± 0.63 vs 3.33 ± 0.78 mmol/L; P = 0.029), day 7 (1.66 ± 0.89 vs 2.25 ± 0.77 mmol/L, P = 0.003), and month 1 (P = 0.036); ST-segment resolution &gt;70%: 60% vs 30% (P &lt; 0.05); Inflammatory markers: Lower IL-6 (P = 0.02) and IL-17 (P = 0.01) in treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: While the evolocumab-rosuvastatin combination did not significantly reduce 6-month MACEs, it demonstrated clinically important benefits including reduced angina frequency, accelerated LDL-C lowering, improved myocardial reperfusion, and attenuated inflammatory response, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support further investigation of intensive lipid-lowering strategies in acute STEMI management.</description>

A key innovation of our approach is a specialized transformation mechanism that maps pre-trained word embeddings into cluster-aware text representations. In this new latent space, the proposed model minimizes the overall overlapping between clusters while improving the cohesion within each cluster. This results in considerable improvements in clustering performance. Since short texts inherently contain both sequential context and localized patterns within their limited context, in this paper a hybrid approach is used by combining both recurrent layers and multi-scale convolutional neural networks to maximize the extractable feature sets from their limited context. This architecture allows us to capture the sequential features and local dependencies by recurrent layer and convolutional layers respectively which leads to generating a more accurate and rich representation for each short text. To evaluate our architecture and because our main focus is on clustering Persian short text, several experiments are conducted in which the results show that the DSN-STC outperforms other approaches in clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) metrics. Also to further test the proposed architecture's generalizability and adaptability in other languages, DSN-STC is evaluated on 2 English benchmark datasets where it consistently outperformed previous approaches in both metrics. These results highlight the model's ability to learn robust and cluster-aware feature representations that are highly useful for effective short text clustering.</description>

While full-dose apixaban (5 mg twice daily) is recommended for secondary prevention, extended use may increase bleeding in this vulnerable population. Reducing the dose to 2.5 mg twice daily after six months of full-dose treatment has been proposed to lower bleeding risk without compromising protection against recurrent VTE. To clarify the safety and efficacy of this strategy, we conducted a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing reduced- versus standard-dose apixaban for extended therapy in patients with cancer-associated VTE. The study followed PRISMA guidelines and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420251026337). Hazard ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effects model, and evidence certainty was assessed with GRADE. Two randomized trials comprising 2,126 patients (EVE, n = 360; API-CAT, n = 1,766) met inclusion criteria. The composite outcome of recurrent VTE with bleeding showed a significantly lower risk with reduced-dose apixaban (risk ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.65-0.96; I2 = 0%), and the composite of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding was also reduced (HR 0.75 (95% CI 0.63-0.88; I2 = 0%). No significant differences were observed for recurrent VTE, major bleeding, clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding, mortality, deep-vein thrombosis, or pulmonary embolism. These findings indicate that reduced-dose apixaban after the initial six months of anticoagulation decreases bleeding without loss of efficacy, supporting dose de-escalation as a safe, evidence-based approach for extended anticoagulation in cancer-associated VTE.

More recently, it has come back into favor for treating venous congestion of surgical sites; however, there is limited data on the number of leeches and application techniques for the head and neck region compared with other anatomical subsites. PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to assess the response to leech therapy in a series of patients with venous congestion, review the literature to determine association between leech therapy use and venous congestion, and provide guidelines for leech therapy for use in the head and neck region. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series of patients treated by the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for venous congestion with leech therapy at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA, was analyzed from 2016 to 2019. All nonleech cases were excluded. Literature review articles were gathered from PubMed and Scopus using the search terms leeching and venous congestion using the Boolean operator and. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variable in this study was tissue loss in reconstructive sites of the head and neck, defined as no tissue loss, partial tissue loss, or complete loss of tissue. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, gender, medical comorbidities, type of operation required, and chief complaint. Number of leeches used, duration, and antibiotic prophylaxis agents were also gathered. Data gathered from articles included in the literature review included study design, population, number of leeches used, duration, complications, and amount of tissue lost or salvaged. ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics were calculated for data gathered from patient cases. RESULTS: Seven cases were reviewed with a mean age of 60.86 years. Five (71%) subjects experienced venous congestion resulting from resection or reconstruction of malignancy and 2 (29%) after laceration repair. Three subjects (43%) had complete recovery from venous congestion following leech therapy. Four subjects (57%) had partial (minor) tissue loss secondary to necrosis. No subject had complete loss of tissue. From the article review, 16 articles were identified, consisting of 3 systematic reviews, one literature review, and 13 retrospective case series ranging from 6 to 277 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Leech therapy is a viable treatment option for venous congestion. Patients should be screened for coagulopathy, use of blood thinners, and psychological acceptance to therapy prior to initiating leech therapy; antibiotic prophylaxis is essential for preventing infection with Aeromonas hydrophila.</description>

This study aimed to develop a hypoxia-related model based on 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the early prediction of tumor response to CIRT in LA-NSCLC patients, thereby identifying patients most likely to benefit from CIRT. METHODS: A total of 42 LA-NSCLC patients, including 25 (60%) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 17 (40%) with non-SCC, underwent 18F-FMISO PET/CT prior to CIRT. 18F-FMISO maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), the tumor-to-muscle ratios (TMR), and hypoxic tumor volume (HTV) were measured, with the TMR ≥ 1.4 threshold defined for hypoxia. The study endpoint was tumor response to CIRT at 3 months. After identifying 18F-FMISO biomarkers related to CIRT response, a prediction model was developed and evaluated using the area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Among the 42 patients analyzed, 17 (40%) achieved partial response (PR) while 25 (60%) had stable disease (SD). 18F-FMISO-PET detected obvious uptake in 31 (74%) patients with LA-NSCLC, although these values were not related to CIRT response (p &gt; 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that favorable responses were significantly more prevalent in hypoxic SCC (TMR ≥ 1.4, n = 15, 36%) patients with smaller HTV (p &lt; 0.01), whereas 18F-FMISO uptake was not significantly correlated with CIRT response in normoxic SCC (TMR &lt; 1.4, n = 10, 24%) or all non-SCC (n = 17, 40%) patients (all p &gt; 0.05). A positive correlation between tumor size and hypoxia was observed in SCC patients (p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HTV was an independent predictor of CIRT response (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 1.14) with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.89 (0.71-1.00) in hypoxic SCC patients. CONCLUSION: 18F-FMISO PET/CT is recommended for SCC patients, especially who are likely to have hypoxia predicted by tumor size, and it holds great promise for selecting patients who will benefit from CIRT.</description>

The high prevalence of HIV further complicates outcomes, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Hyperthermia has emerged as a valuable adjunct to treatment in high-income countries, particularly for locally advanced cancers such as cervical and head and neck tumours, which are common in resource-constrained settings. Uptake of hyperthermia in LMICs has however been limited. A phase III randomised controlled trial in a South African public hospital demonstrated that modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT), a capacitively coupled heating technique, was feasible in this setting. The trial, the first to assess hyperthermia in Africa and to include HIV-positive participants, found that adding mEHT to chemoradiotherapy significantly improved 5-year disease-free survival (32% vs. 14%; HR:0.73; 95%CI:0.53-1.00; p=0.049); reduced recurrence, and improved quality of life without increasing toxicity. Benefits were observed equally in HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated an 82.2% probability of cost savings over three years, primarily due to fewer recurrences and residual disease and improved quality of life. Given its affordability, ease of integration, and lack of additional toxicity, mEHT represents a promising adjunct to chemoradiation in LMICs. Further replication in LMICs beyond sub-Saharan Africa is needed to confirm generalisability to diverse healthcare settings.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Best DL, Yau V, Farsio F, Markiewicz MR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.007'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478302/'&gt;41478302&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is common in patients with repaired cleft palate. Speech surgery, which encompasses operative procedures to improve velopharyngeal function and speech resonance, has been associated with postoperative obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the relative risk of OSA between different speech surgery procedures remains unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative risk of OSA following pharyngeal flap versus nonpharyngeal flap procedures, which included dynamic sphincter pharyngoplasty (DSP), Furlow palatoplasty, and buccal myomucosal flaps (BMMF). DATA SOURCES: An electronic literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included patients with a history of repaired cleft palate and VPI requiring speech surgery, published between 1994 and 2024. Studies specifically included comparison data between pharyngeal flap and nonpharyngeal flap techniques. Exclusion criteria were case reports, abstracts, and reviews. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted per the the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Demographics, speech procedure data, OSA frequency, and follow-up data were recorded. The primary comparison was procedure type including pharyngeal flap versus nonpharyngeal flap procedures. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with P values &lt;.05 considered statistically significant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was relative risk of postoperative OSA between procedure types. RESULTS: Four studies met inclusion criteria, which included 751 subjects. Pharyngeal flap was associated with a significantly greater risk of postoperative OSA compared to nonpharyngeal flap procedures (pooled risk ratio = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.20 to 5.01, P = .01). Subgroup analysis showed that palatal lengthening procedures had a significantly lower risk of OSA than pharyngeal flap (risk ratio = 0.39, P = .002); however, there was no difference in postoperative OSA between DSP and pharyngeal flap (P = .68) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Palatal lengthening procedures had a lower risk of postoperative OSA than pharyngeal flap. There was no difference in postoperative OSA between pharyngeal flap and DSP. As such, in patients with preoperative OSA or patients at high risk for developing OSA, it may be prudent to use palatal lengthening procedures as a first-line option for the correction of VPI.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical evaluations and epithelial cell smears were done on ventral tongue, buccal, and labial mucosa before treatment (T0), after 30 (T30), and 120 days (T120) of PrEP use. Clinical changes were assessed using questionnaires and oral examinations, and a descriptive analysis was performed. Cellular changes were observed through liquid-based exfoliative cytology, and the Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were applied. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (60 males, 3 females; mean age 29.65) were included; 36 returned at T30 and 20 at T120. Most frequent complaints were dry mouth and increased fluid intake. Wilcoxon test showed no systematic observer error (P &gt; .05). Karyomegaly increased significantly in all sites at T30 and in ventral tongue and buccal mucosa at T30 and T120 (P &lt; .05). Keratinization increased significantly in buccal mucosa at T30 and ventral tongue at T30 and T120 (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an increase in oral epithelial changes during the first 30 and 120 days of PrEP use. Although these changes are nonspecific, continuous oral health monitoring may support early detection of alterations and adherence among patients on HIV PrEP.</description>

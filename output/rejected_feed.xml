      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Silvani C, Tylecki A, Santangelo A, Stephens A, Considine J, Gishto R, Perry M, Nazzani S, Briganti A, Salonia A, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70241'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41457426/'&gt;41457426&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy influenced by socioeconomic factors. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, and its association with penile cancer stage at presentation has not been studied. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the ADI and advanced-stage disease at diagnosis in penile cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services database of patients aged ≥18 years with penile squamous cell carcinoma from 2004 to 2019. Advanced-stage disease was defined as pathological T stage ≥2, pathological evidence of nodal metastasis, or reported presence of distal metastasis. ADI scores were compared to the national median value. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the ADI and advanced disease after adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Among 353 patients (median age, 72 years; 84.4% White), the median ADI score was 69. Patients were stratified into two groups on the basis of the national median; 76% were in the high-ADI group. Black patients were more prevalent in the higher ADI group (15.3% vs. 2.4%; p = .003). Advanced-stage penile cancer was more frequent in the higher ADI group (49.3% vs. 36.5%; p = .04). In multivariable analysis, each 10-point increase in the ADI was associated with 1.16-fold increased odds of advanced-stage disease (95% CI, 1.04-1.29; p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Greater neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation is associated with advanced-stage disease at penile cancer diagnosis. These findings emphasize the role of social determinants in disease presentation, and may guide targeted interventions in disadvantaged populations.</description>

Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00614-X'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00614-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449147/'&gt;41449147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The CATNON trial investigated the benefit of the addition of concurrent or adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy in individuals with anaplastic astrocytoma. We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide. INTERPRETATION: Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hsu CH, Lu Z, Gao S, Wang J, Sun JM, Liu T, Fan Q, Cai J, Ge F, Li S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Lancet. Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449142/'&gt;41449142&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for additional and more efficacious therapies for patients with unresectable metastatic oesophageal cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding tiragolumab and atezolizumab to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: The SKYSCRAPER-08 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 67 centres in mainland China, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with treatment-naive, unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel [175 mg/m2] and cisplatin [60-80 mg/m2]) or placebo and chemotherapy through intravenous infusion for six 21-day cycles. The primary outcomes were independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned patients, regardless of whether they received any study treatment). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04540211, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, 461 patients were assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=229) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=232); 406 (88%) were male and 55 (12%) female, and all patients were Asian. Median survival follow-up was 12·6 months (IQR 6·8-18·0). Median independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival (cutoff June 15, 2022) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group was 6·2 months (95% CI 5·7-7·2) versus 5·4 months (95% CI 4·4-5·5) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·45-0·70; p&lt;0·0001). Median overall survival (cutoff Feb 13, 2023) was 15·7 months (95% CI 13·3-20·4) and 11·1 months (95% CI 9·6-13·6; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·88; p=0·0024). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group versus the placebo and chemotherapy group were white blood cell count decrease (46 [20%] of 228 vs 35 [15%] of 227), neutrophil count decrease (78 [34%] vs 78 [34%]), and anaemia (19 [8%] vs 24 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 94 (41%) of 228 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group and 89 (39%) of 227 in the placebo and chemotherapy group; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia (17 [7%] of 228 and 13 [6%] of 227). Treatment-related deaths occurred in six patients (3%) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group (immune-mediated lung disease, pneumonitis, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, and bacterial pneumonia) and two (1%) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (gastrointestinal infection and death of unknown cause). No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION: Independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group compared with chemotherapy alone for unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These data support the rationale for exploring dual checkpoint inhibition added to chemotherapy for this group of patients with a high unmet need.

METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancers receiving oral targeted therapies were randomized (2:1) to a 3-month home-based SPEP (with a coach at home) or recommended adapted physical exercises (booklet). Primary endpoint was feasibility defined as the rate of patients who performed at least 50% of the theoretically planned sessions in the SPEP arm. Main secondary endpoints were fatigue and pain evaluated by VAS scale during the program. RESULTS: Among 112 patients, 74 and 38 were included in the SPEP and control arms, respectively. Median age was 59 (range: 31-83) years and the majority of patients) were women. Main primary tumor location was breast (57%) and kidney (16%). Thirty-three (30%) patients were treated with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 53 (47%) received epidermal growth factor receptor or cell cycle inhibitors. Forty-five (61%) patients performed at least 50% of the SPEP. Median fatigue decreased from 4 to 3 (range: 0-10) after 3 months in the SPEP group with maintain of pain control. The percentage of patients with high level VAS of fatigue at 3 months was lower in SPEP arm than in the control arm (27% versus 62%, p-value = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: QUALIOR showed that SPEP with a coach at home was feasible in patients with metastatic cancers treated with oral targeted therapies. This program could mitigate the fatigue induced by oral targeted therapies.</description>

We compared OpenAI's o3 model, which uses an iterative planning loop, with the baseline GPT-4o on 459 oral and maxillofacial (OMF) cases drawn from standard textbooks. Each case consisted of two to five high-resolution haematoxylin-and-eosin micrographs, and both models were queried in zero-shot mode with an identical prompt requesting a single diagnosis and supporting microscopic features. Overall, o3 correctly classified 31.6% of cases, significantly surpassing GPT-4o at 18.7% (Δ = 12.9%, P &lt; 0.001). The largest gain was recorded for the heterogeneous "other conditions" category (37.2% versus 20.2%). For correctly diagnosed cases, o3 generated more detailed descriptions (median Likert score 9 versus 8, P = 0.003). These benefits were offset by longer mean response time (98 s versus near-instant) and lower reproducibility across repeated queries (40.2% versus 57.6%). A board-certified general pathologist achieved 28.3% accuracy on the same image set, underscoring the difficulty of the task. Ground truth was established by two board-certified OMF pathologists with high inter-rater reliability, ensuring the reliability of the reference standard. The general pathologist served only as a non-OMF difficulty benchmark. The findings indicate that advanced reasoning mechanisms materially improve diagnostic performance and explanatory depth in complex histopathology, but additional optimisation is required to meet clinical speed and consistency thresholds. Clinically, such models are adjunctive 'copilots' for preliminary descriptions and differential diagnoses; expert OMF pathologists retain full responsibility for sign-out.</description>

Previous literature has identified a link between the gut and ASD; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been extensively reported in cohort studies of ASD, and specific microbial metabolites or by-products may serve as potential biomarkers for ASD. Additionally, children with ASD often exhibit food refusal, have a limited food repertoire and display a tendency to consume the same foods frequently; thus, these behaviours increase their risk of malnutrition (over-nutrition or under-nutrition) compared to typically developing (TD) healthy children. This study primarily aims to identify oral and gut microbiota among children with ASD and TD healthy children. The secondary aim is to determine the associations between oral and gut microbiota with nutritional status among children with ASD. The findings will enhance understanding of the aetiology of ASD and inform early intervention strategies to mitigate disease severity and early identification of malnutrition in genetically at-risk children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This observational, age-matched, case-control study is conducted in Malaysia among 40 male children with ASD and age-matched with 40 TD healthy controls aged 4-10 years. The dependent variables include the microbiota profile, identified through metagenomic sequencing analysis of saliva and faecal samples, and autism severity, assessed through validated questionnaires. Independent variables include nutritional status, determined through Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA), anthropometry and dietary measurements, gastrointestinal symptoms, eating behaviour, behavioural profile, and sleep quality. Data collection is expected to be completed by June 2026. The study nature may limit causality establishment. Analyses will use chi-square/ANOVA for group comparisons, SparCC for microbiota correlations, and mixed-effects logistic regression to model associations. CONCLUSION: This study advances understanding of ASD-related microbiota, guiding personalised nutrition and precision healthcare in Malaysia.</description>

However, current detection methods experience a marked performance degradation in the presence of deep watermarking within images. In this paper, we propose a multi-module model, which integrates Efficient Multi-scale Attention within Xception as the detection module and introduces a feature dropout module to eliminate redundant image features. Experimental results demonstrate that when 50% and 100% of the images in the dataset contain MBRS watermarks, the accuracy (ACC) metrics of our model are comparable to those of existingbaseline models. However, when 50% and 100% of the images contain FaceSigns watermarks, the ACC metrics of our model outperform those of other baseline models by approximately 10% and 20%, respectively.</description>

Bedaquiline and levofloxacin are the primary drug regimen for MDR-TB treatment in Indonesia. This study aimed to investigate whether the Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline and levofloxacin differs between patients with sputum conversion and those without sputum conversion during the first four months of MDR-TB treatment in Indonesia. METHODS: A cohort study was performed in adult patients (18-65 years old) treated with the 18-24-month oral regimen. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or HIV positive, with uncontrolled diabetes, or had any of the following severe conditions: cancer, digestive, cardiovascular system disorders, hepatic, or renal problems. Two blood samples were collected to measure the plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and levofloxacin using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates from patients' sputum were used to determine the MIC of individual drugs using liquid growth media (MGIT). RESULTS: Among the 74 patients enrolled, 16 dropped out during the four-month follow-up period. Blood samples were successfully obtained 1-2 hours after drug administration from 48 patients and 4-6 hours after drug administration from 32 patients, which were used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Sputum conversion was detected in 84.5% of patients during four months of the MDR-TB treatment. The mean Cmax/MIC ratio of bedaquiline was higher in the sputum conversion group compared with the non-conversion group (9.10 vs. 1.65, respectively). Meanwhile, a small difference in the Cmax/MIC ratio of levofloxacin was observed between the sputum conversion group and the non-conversion group; it was not significant (45.64 vs. 41.72, respectively; p = 0.941). CONCLUSIONS: Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline was higher in MDR-TB patients with sputum conversion compared to those without conversion within the first four months of treatment, suggesting a potential relationship between Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline and sputum conversion, which was not seen in the levofloxacin cases. However, the application of clinical practice should be carefully considered and supported by further study in various settings.</description>

As China's highest national authority organ, the National People's Congress (NPC) plays an important role in China's development. The trust of the Chinese public for the NPC objectively reflects the level of trust by the Chinese public and their confidence in the people's congress system. METHODS: Based on Chinese general social survey (CGSS) 2021 data and using SPSS22 software, this paper examines the impact of public Internet use on political trust through binary logistic analysis and ordinal regression analysis methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Research showed that the use of the Internet and its use frequency does not affect public's responsiveness to political trust questions, but the use of the Internet affects the political trust level of the public. People who do not use the Internet at all and those who use the Internet daily are significantly different, and the former hold a higher political trust level than the latter. Moreover, the level of trust of people using the Internet several times per week is markedly lower than that of daily Internet users; no significant differences were found in the level of trust of people using the Internet several times a year or less, several times a month, and daily.</description>

Optimizing inhaled medication delivery to both regions remain a therapeutic challenge. This study evaluates the ability of orally inhaled aerosol particles to achieve dual‑site deposition in SGS and bronchopulmonary regions. STUDY DESIGN: Computational modeling of orally inhaled drug particle delivery. SETTING: Academic Medical Center. METHODS: Digitally modified airways simulating 8 SGS variants, combining McCaffrey Stage I (5 mm) and II (15 mm) subglottic lengths with Cotton‑Myer Grade I (10%, 30%), Grade II (60%), and Grade III (90%) luminal constrictions. Oral inhalation at 15 L/min and particle transport were simulated for fluticasone propionate (FP; mean aerosol velocity 9.19 m/s, particle size range 1-8 μm) and ciclesonide (CIC; mean aerosol velocity 4.26 m/s, particle size range 1-4 μm) inhaler characteristics, and 6 particle‑size distributions M1(1-5 μm), M2(6-10 μm), M3(1-10 μm) while maintaining the respective parent (CIC and FP) mean aerosol velocity. RESULTS: In the normal airway, CIC and FP inhalers achieved &gt;80% bronchial deposition but ≤0.02% subglottic delivery. Among modified devices, M2CIC optimized dual targeting, providing the highest subglottic deposition (0.09%) with preserved bronchial efficiency (69.46%). In SGS models, M2CIC and M2FP consistently achieved the most balanced delivery, with maximum deposition of M2CIC = 8.4% and M2FP = 7.86% at subglottic region, and M2CIC = 69.89% and M2FP = 61.02% at bronchial site. M3 variants offered intermediate dual deposition at advanced and Grade III stenosis stages. CONCLUSION: M2CIC and M2FP inhaler modifications optimized dual-site supporting tailored device strategies for SGS with coexisting bronchopulmonary disease.</description>

METHODS: A systematic review and arm-based Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Aspirin (ASA), dextran, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (IV UFH, SC UFH), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were compared with no prophylaxis. Primary outcomes were total and partial flap loss, vascular complications, hematoma, and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies (17 773 patients) were included. IV UFH significantly increased hematoma risk (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.36-13.22) and LMWH modestly raised reoperation rates (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.00-5.01). No regimen consistently reduced flap loss or thrombosis compared with no prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotic agents showed limited benefit in reducing flap-related complications. These findings support individualized prophylaxis and highlight the need for prospective studies to inform evidence-based guidelines.</description>

The relationships between nasal anatomy, inspiratory airflow and olfaction remain unclear, including if nasal anatomic and functional factors account for some variabilities in odor identification in the absence of sensorineural defects. This preliminary study aimed to analyze olfactory cleft airflow dynamics using computational modeling techniques and to develop linear regression models linking smell identification scores to nasal anatomy and computational-derived functional metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics modeling was used to generate nasal airflow-related parameters based on radiographic images of 10 subjects with varying olfactory acuity, but without prior nasal surgery or nasal deformity. Olfaction was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (SIT). RESULTS: Average olfactory airflow volume comprised only 2.43% of total nasal airflow volume. Higher olfactory resistance demonstrated strong associations with higher SIT scores. No one particular anatomic or functional parameter correlated strongly with SIT score. However, the 3-parameter linear regression model comprising bilateral nasal surface area-to-volume ratio, bilateral nasal resistance and olfactory resistance accounted for 82% of the variations in SIT scores (P = .01). Among 2-parameter linear regression models, the model comprising bilateral nasal surface area-to-volume ratio and bilateral nasal resistance accounted for 52% of SIT score variability (P = .08). DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that a significant portion of variability in SIT scores can be explained by the combination of nasal resistance, olfactory resistance, and nasal surface area-to-volume ratio, suggesting that nasal anatomy and airflow-related quantities contribute toward variability in olfaction.

We present a rare case of an expansile tumor within the right thyroid ala that was suspected to represent a chondrosarcoma but was found on pathology to represent a hemangioma. Imaging and pathologic features are reviewed as well as approach to resection and reconstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male presented with progressive neck fullness and decreased vocal range. He was found to have an expansile mass within the right thyroid ala with associated supraglottic fullness on flexible laryngoscopy. Initial primary differential consideration was chondrosarcoma versus chondroma. He underwent open resection with reconstruction of the right thyroid ala using a rib graft and titanium plate which was used to secure the graft to the contralateral thyroid ala and the ipsilateral inner thyroid perichondrium. Intraoperative frozen sections indicated atypical cartilage cells, but final histopathology revealed a hemangioma with suspected reactive changes in the thyroid cartilage. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with rare presentations of hemangiomas in atypical locations, such as the thyroid cartilage. It is one of the first reports of hemangioma occurring within the thyroid cartilage. Excision with reconstruction using a rib graft can be employed for large thyroid cartilage tumors.</description>

METHODS: A cross-sectional, within-subject study was conducted during a CME-accredited national frontal sinus surgery simulation course. Participants completed pre- and post-course surveys rating potential deterrents to FSS. Paired statistical analyses assessed changes in deterrent ratings, and correlational analyses evaluated relationships with surgical experience and case volume. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed both pre- and post-course surveys. Mean time in practice was 14 years, with an average FSS volume of 2 cases per month. Baseline deterrence was moderate (mean 5.10/10), driven primarily by concern for skull base violation and technical difficulty. Following simulation, overall deterrence decreased significantly by 1.27 points (to 3.83; P &lt; .05), with 7 of 9 deterrents showing significant reduction. The largest improvements were seen in apprehension regarding skull base injury, technical challenge, and adequacy of dissection. Factors related to operative time and prior experience showed minimal change. Case volume correlated with lower baseline and post-simulation hesitancy for select deterrents, while years in practice and interval since last FSS did not. All participants reported improved confidence, and the majority anticipated increased incorporation of FSS into their practice. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based CME significantly reduced modifiable deterrents and improved confidence among practicing otolaryngologists performing FSS, regardless of years in practice. These findings support simulation as a valuable adjunct for ongoing professional development, enabling experienced surgeons to recalibrate risk perception, refine technical judgment, and support lifelong surgical learning.</description>

TAS-117 is an oral, selective, non-adenosine triphosphate-competitive allosteric AKT inhibitor that showed encouraging antitumor activity in a phase I study. This phase II study aimed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of TAS-117 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, including those harboring germline PTEN-inactivating mutations (EudraCT: 2020-004770-22). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase II study, the 3 + 3 phase I-like dose escalation lead-in part A enrolled patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors irrespective of gene alterations (all-comers). Patients received TAS-117 once daily (o.d.) or intermittent dosing (ID) regimens (4 days on/3 days off), with a 16-mg/day o.d. or 24-mg/day ID starting dose. The primary objective was safety and to define maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The dose/regimen confirmation part B was to further assess RP2D in patients harboring germline PTEN mutations. RESULTS: Overall, 17 patients were enrolled in part A (all-comers n = 16, dose and regimen confirmation, n = 1). Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in three patients [febrile neutropenia at 20 mg o.d. (n = 1); grade 3 oral mucositis at 28 mg ID (n = 2)]. Most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (all grade/grade ≥3) were rash (58.8%/17.6%), fatigue (35.3%/1%), pruritus (29.4%/0%), hyperglycemia (29.4%/1%), and decreased appetite (17.6%/0%). RP2D was determined to be 16 mg/kg o.d. Seven patients had stable disease. One of two patients with a germline PTEN mutation (metaplastic breast cancer) had stable disease ongoing for 19.1 months as of the data cut-off. The study was closed due to enrollment challenges in the germline PTEN mutation carrier population. CONCLUSIONS: TAS-117 at the RP2D of 16 mg o.d. was tolerable, with a manageable safety profile. Clinical benefit, although durable, was only observed in a single patient with a germline PTEN mutation.</description>

Patients with unresectable, metastatic disease are candidates for approved agent targeted therapies such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, or selpercatinib, but toxicity is often an issue. Preclinical data supported the potential use of immunotherapy targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in this indolent disease. METHODS: Patients with advanced/recurrent MTC were randomly assigned into a 1:1 ratio to receive a saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)-based immunotherapy (GI-6207) targeting CEA starting at the time of enrollment or 6 months after surveillance. The primary endpoint was to compare the calcitonin growth rate in the GI-6207 arm at 6 months, with patients in the surveillance arm at 6 months. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and May 2018, 34 patients were randomly assigned to receive yeast-CEA vaccine (GI-6207) starting at the time of enrollment or 6 months after surveillance. Mean age was 51 years, and 82% of patients were diagnosed with sporadic MTC. There was no significant change in the calcitonin growth rates at 6 months when the immunotherapy group was compared with the surveillance group (-2.490042 vs. -2.526385; p = 0.3760). Treatment with GI-6207 was associated with increased peripheral CEA specific CD4 and/or CD8 T cells, with15/26 (58%) patients displaying increases after 3 months of treatment. One patient had a significant inflammatory event 17 months after the last vaccine at a known lymph node, perhaps related to a delayed immune response. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Grade 1 injection site reactions were most common. CONCLUSION: The immunotherapy was well tolerated, but did not have an impact on tumor growth rate at 6 months as measured by calcitonin kinetics.

In prostate cancer, they may help overcome AR resistance mechanisms at the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is the binding site of approved androgen receptor pathway inhibitors like enzalutamide. Masofaniten (EPI-7386) is a next-generation aniten with promising activity and safety in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, single arm, single-institution trial, patients with treatment-naïve metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) were enrolled in a Simon 2-stage study design to receive the combination of masofaniten 600 mg BID and enzalutamide 160 mg daily with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The study was designed to enroll 35 patients (13 patients in stage 1, then 22 patients in stage 2). The trial would move to stage 2 if 9 or more subjects achieved a biochemical response at 6 months. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were screened and enrolled into stage 1. Five were African American, and eight were Caucasian. The median age was 68 years (range 52-75) at time of enrollment. Median follow-up time was 9.9 months (range 7.7-13.6). Ten of 13 patients (77% with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% - 92%) achieved a PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL at 6 months, achieving the threshold to move on to stage 2. Only one patient had disease progression to mCRPC and died of disease at the time of data cutoff. Patients continued enzalutamide and ADT after trial closure. CONCLUSION: The combination of masofaniten and enzalutamide for treatment-naïve mHSPC did show efficacy and had an acceptable safety profile. These results support further investigation of the dual AR blockade in mHSPC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06312670).</description>

METHODS: Sixty-six adults with allergic rhinitis and fourty five normophonic adults without allergic rhinitis were included in the study. Medical history, skin prick test, endoscopic nasal examination, Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), laryngeal imaging, Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI), Cepstral Peak Prominence Smoothed (CPPS), aerodynamic measurements (/a/,/s/,/z/ and s/z ratio), Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale (VTD), Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI), Reflux Finding Score (RFS), Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and auditory perceptual assessment (GRBAS) tools were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Allergic rhinitis is associated with adverse effects on the vocal tract, with discomfort increasing as the severity of rhinitis worsens. CONCLUSION: Voice-protective practices appear important to minimize the risk of dysphonia in patients with allergic rhinitis.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate and contrast treatment findings between VFSI and voice therapy for VFNs. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 50 female patients with VFNs received either percutaneous intralesional triamcinolone injection or Accent method voice therapy. Serial evaluations-including videoendoscopic (nodule size, mucosal wave, glottic gap), subjective (auditory perceptual assessment, Voice Handicap Index), and objective (acoustic, aerodynamic) measures-were conducted at baseline and at 1 week and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-months post-treatment. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in nodule size and improvements in mucosal wave patterns and glottic gaps over the 6 months (p &lt; 0.05). Most subjective and objective measures also enhanced significantly in both groups over the same study period (p &lt; 0.05). However, voice therapy outperformed VFSI in most parameters (videoendoscopic, subjective, and objective) by the end of the third month (p &lt; 0.05) and in nodule size reduction by the sixth month (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: VFSI is a rapid and reliable therapeutic solution for VFNs with outcomes comparable to voice therapy. Long-term data, however, demonstrate voice therapy better prevents nodule recurrence. Therefore, subsequent voice therapy or repeated injections may enhance the long-term efficacy of VFSI.</description>

The objective of this study was to introduce a transoral submandibular surgical technique that has not been previously described in the literature. This technique was compared to the classic Sistrunk procedure and the vestibular approach, which is preferred in endoscope-robot-assisted methods. METHOD: The present study encompasses a cohort of 12 patients diagnosed with TGDC between 2011 and 2022, who underwent surgical intervention utilizing the transoral submandibular approach technique. The transoral submandibular technique is described in detail and compared with the classical transcervical technique and other transoral approach techniques. These comparisons are discussed in the light of current literature. RESULTS: The total number of patients included in the study was 12, with ages ranging from 4 to 17 years. The duration of symptoms ranged from 6 to 120 months. The surgical duration ranged from 80 to 180 min, with an average of 102 ± 14.5 min. No intraoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The development of minimally invasive techniques has emerged as a response to the external incision scar problem associated with the Sistrunk procedure, the prevailing treatment for TGDC. These techniques hold considerable promise, yet the optimal technique remains elusive. It is hypothesized that the transoral submandibular approach for thyroglossal duct cyst excision will make a positive contribution to the literature in this context.</description>

While previous studies have reported disruption of bee gut microbial communities following pesticide exposure, the effects of short-term sublethal exposure in stingless bees remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (LC50/100 and LC50/1000) on the midgut microbiota composition of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Using metabarcoding of the V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA to characterize bacterial community composition and diversity, we analysed midgut bacterial communities of bees collected directly from hives (T0 group) and after 24 and 48 hours of oral imidacloprid exposure. Our results showed that, after 24 and 48 hours of exposure, there were no significant changes in midgut bacterial diversity or composition between bees exposed to sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid and their respective controls. In contrast, we observed clear differences in both diversity and abundance between the T0 group and control groups, especially after 24 hours of incubation. These differences were primarily associated with shifts in Acetobacteraceae family, likely reflecting the influence of the artificial sucrose diet provided under laboratory conditions. It is important to note that our findings pertain only to acute effects. Future studies would benefit from extending the duration of exposure and including a broader range of toxicological endpoints to build on these findings. Our results also underscore the importance of evaluating both exposure period and dietary conditions when investigating pesticide impacts on bee microbiota.</description>

Preclinical studies suggest that this may result from inflammation-induced destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in vessel wall inflammation assessed using [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after ICI initiation. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma who received at least one cycle of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor avelumab and underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT before initiation of treatment and after 3 months. The primary outcome was the change in the target-to-background ratio (TBRmax) in the descending aorta between baseline and first follow-up scan. Secondary outcomes included the change in TBRmax in the carotid arteries, spleen, and bone marrow, and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included (66% male; median age 75 years). Most patients had established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (62%). The [18F]FDG TBRmax in the descending aorta increased from 1.52 (IQR, 1.39-1.70) at baseline to 1.64 (IQR, 1.41-1.97) after 3 months of treatment (change 7.8%. p = 0.022). No significant changes were observed in the carotid arteries, bone marrow, and spleen. Statin use was not associated with an attenuated change in TBRmax. During a median follow-up of 2.3 (IQR, 1.5-4.2) years, one nonfatal ischemic stroke occurred. CONCLUSION: Avelumab treatment was associated with an increase in [18F]FDG uptake in the descending aorta after 3 months of treatment, which may be a potential marker of inflammation-driven accelerated atherosclerosis in patients receiving ICIs.</description>

The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib using a pooled analysis of patients with CCA from the RAGNAR and LUC2001 studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In RAGNAR (phase 2, global, tumor-agnostic study) and LUC2001 (an open-label, multicenter, phase 2a study in Asian patients), patients with advanced solid tumors after ≥1 prior lines of therapy received once-daily oral erdafitinib (8 mg/day with an option for pharmacodynamically guided up-titration to 9 mg). Patients were pooled for efficacy (objective response rate [ORR] per a blinded independent review committee, duration of response [DOR], progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) and safety analyses. RESULTS: At a median efficacy follow-up of 14.7 months in 78 erdafitinib-treated patients (RAGNAR: n=66; LUC2001: n=12), ORR was 55% (95% CI: 43.4-66.4). Median time to response was 1.7 months; median DOR, PFS, and OS were 6.9 (95% CI: 4.37-8.61), 8.5 (95% CI: 6.83 -9.72), and 18.1 (95% CI: 13.40-24.28) months, respectively. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83%), stomatitis (72%), diarrhea (68%), dry mouth (51%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (51%); 42% had serious TEAEs, and 12% had TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analyses confirm the robust efficacy of erdafitinib in a diverse population of pretreated patients with advanced/metastatic CCA harboring prespecified FGFR alterations. These findings are consistent with previously observed efficacy of FGFR-targeted agents in patients with CCA.</description>

We previously reported a randomized trial targeting women who had not attended screening after &gt;10 invitations, where sending of self-sampling kits resulted in a 19% attendance and a positive predictive value (PPV) for high grade lesions (HSIL+) of 40%, despite no triaging after the HPV test. Because of the striking results, the intervention was extended to all women resident in Stockholm County, Sweden, in the years 2019/20, who had not attended screening &gt;10 years (N = 42,409). Participation was 35.6% and 11.6% of the participating women were HPV-positive. Among these, there were 43 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 319 cases of high-grade lesions. The PPV was particularly high for HPV16/18 positive women (12% for invasive cancer and 59% for HSIL). In summary, participation with HPV self-sampling among long-term non-attenders in the real-life program was considerably higher than in the research setting and the high yield of HSIL+ implied high effectiveness.</description>

This multicenter study evaluates age-specific performance of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as cross-sectional and longitudinal screening for cervical cancer among 28,501 Chinese women. At baseline, HPV screening with cytology triage demonstrates higher sensitivity (96.9% vs. 79.7%) but slightly lower specificity (88.8% vs. 92.7%) than cytology with HPV triage for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). HPV sensitivities remain high across age groups (≤35: 100.0%; 36-45: 96.4%; &gt;45: 96.8%), consistently exceeding the corresponding cytology sensitivities (66.7%, 75.7%, and 84.9%). Over a three-year follow-up, HPV screening maintains superior sensitivity (93.1% vs. 58.1%) and slightly lower specificity (89.6% vs. 92.4%) compared with cytology. Age-stratified analyses in the longitudinal setting reveal trends similar to those observed in the cross-sectional analyses. Women positive for HPV16/18 have a 43.0% three-year risk of CIN2+, compared with 0.2% for HPV-negative women. These findings support the durable protection of HPV-based screening and the feasibility of extending screening intervals.</description>

METHODS: Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2007-August 2023) among individuals aged 9-26 years, we assessed trends in HPV vaccination prevalence (≥ 1 dose) with joinpoint regression to identify inflection points and estimate annual percent changes (APCs). Analyses were stratified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Vaccination prevalence increased from 14.1% (95% CI, 10.1-19.3) in 2007-2008 to 49.1% (95% CI, 44.5-53.7) in 2021-2023 (APC, 6.8%; p = 0.001). Females experienced an early sharp rise (APC, 24.0%; p &lt; 0.001) through 2011-2012, followed by slower growth thereafter (APC, 3.7%; p = 0.004). Male vaccination increased steadily (APC, 11.3%; p &lt; 0.001). By 2021-2023, prevalence was highest among 13-17-year-olds (58.2%) and lowest among 9-12-year-olds (26.2%). Black individuals had the lowest vaccination prevalence of any racial/ethnic group (29.3%) and experienced a reversal of prior gains after 2015-2016 (APC, - 2.3%; p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination prevalence more than tripled between 2007 and 2023, but the pace of growth slowed among females and reversed among Black individuals, which may exacerbate existing disparities in HPV-related cancer burden.</description>

Lipofuscin is a permanent intracellular deposit that accumulates with aging or oxidative stress. Its increase in skeletal muscles may lead to limitations in muscle function, such as weakness and fatigue. We aim to investigate whether lipofuscin deposits in the upper airway muscles of patients with severe OSA are increased compared to those in patients with primary snoring or very mild OSA. METHODS: We studied pharyngeal framework muscle tissue samples from non-obese adults, with one group having severe OSA and another having primary snoring or very mild OSA (snorer group). Lipofuscin was identified by analyzing staining patterns from Sudan Black B and fluorescence microscopy. We compared lipofuscin levels and distribution in the muscle fibers between the groups. RESULTS: Despite presenting similar age and body mass index, patients with severe OSA exhibited markedly larger and more concentrated deposits of lipofuscin in the upper airway muscles, particularly along the borders of the muscle fascicles, compared to the snorer group. CONCLUSION: Compared to primary snorers, patients with severe OSA accumulate lipofuscin in their pharyngeal muscles. Our findings may provide novel insight into the role of lipofuscin as both a marker and a cause of the aggravation of OSA, in light of a possible lipofuscin-induced progressive myopathy.</description>

METHODS: This study (NCT03072160) was designed to evaluate two cohorts of patients with medullary thyroid cancer, a cancer that is not known to have therapeutic responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. One cohort included patients with previous immunotherapy (GI-6207, an experimental therapeutic cancer targeting carcinoembryonic antigen), and a second cohort included patients with no previous history of GI-6207. All patients were treated with standard of care dosing of pembrolizumab, 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Patients were followed with imaging every 3 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated at 3 months for immune responses. RESULTS: 17 patients were enrolled on this study. Among the 13 patients with previous immunotherapy (GI-6207), the median age was 52.4 years. Among the 4 patients with no previous immunotherapy the median age was 58.8 years. No patients in either cohort had evidence of therapeutic response. No patients had confirmed 50% declines in either serum carcinoembryonic antigen or calcitonin. No radiographic responses were observed. There was no evidence of immune impact of pembrolizumab in analysis of PBMCs. Given the lack of responses in the previous immunotherapy cohort, the study was closed early. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not support the hypothesis that sequencing immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor could enhance the clinical activity of the immune checkpoint, which has not demonstrated independent activity in that disease previously.</description>

Our aim was to access the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy for locally advanced PSCC. METHODS: In this prospective, single-arm clinical study, eligible patients received Nab-Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 D1), Cisplatin (70 mg/m2 in 3 days), Bleomycin (30 mg D1, 8), and tislelizumab (200 mg D1) every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles, followed by consolidative treatment if necessary. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Of all 20 enrolled patients, 75.0% (15/20) had a history of previous penectomy and were recurrence cases. The median treatment cycles was 4 (range: 2-6). The ORR reached 75.0%. 35.0% (7/20) of patients underwent consolidative surgery, and 55.0% (11/20) received maintenance immunotherapy (median 7 cycles). At median follow-up of 29.3 months, the median PFS and the median overall survival (OS) were 12.5 months (95% CI 7.4-NE), 22.8 months (95% CI 13.7-NE), respectively. Grade≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 40% (8/20) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tislelizumab with chemotherapy demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in locally advanced PSCC, with a manageable safety profile.</description>

However, robust quantitative data on their absorption, distribution, and excretion in mammals remain scarce. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of polystyrene (PS) NP biodistribution and elimination in rats using 14C-radiolabeling, the most accurate and quantitative method available. Pregnant rats were exposed to 14C-labeled 20 nm or 100 nm PS NPs (PS20 or PS100) via oral gavage, intratracheal aerosolization, or intravenous injection, and tissue distribution and excretion were determined by radioactivity measurements. We found that PS NPs were exclusively excreted through faeces, irrespective of the exposure routes, without urinary elimination. Both PS20 and PS100 crossed multiple biological barriers, yet only PS20 reached the brain. Maternal transfer of PS20 occurred through both placenta and milk, while PS100 transferred solely via milk. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model further simulated accumulation kinetics across tissues. This study establishes the most comprehensive and reliable quantitative profile of PS NP biodistribution in mammals to date, revealing distinct size-dependent translocation patterns that provide a robust foundation for evaluating their health impacts.</description>

While fecal-oral transmission is the primary route of infection, emerging evidence indicates that saliva may also function as a reservoir for these viruses, posing a potential risk for oral transmission. Previous studies have primarily focused on the decay of viruses in aqueous matrices, like wastewater and freshwater, but the persistence of these viruses in human saliva remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of AdV41 and CVB3 in both human and artificial saliva under various conditions, including the presence of fecal particles and specific oral bacteria. Our findings demonstrated that human saliva significantly reduced viral stability compared to artificial saliva, with marked reductions in viral titers observed within 24-48 hours. Particularly, the presence of fecal particles in both saliva types extended CVB3 viral persistence, suggesting a protective effect due to particle adsorption. However, AdV41 demonstrated an opposite trend when in the presence of fecal particles, suggesting virus-specific differences in how particulate matter influences stability. Additionally, specific oral bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans, significantly enhanced CVB3 stability, with a mean viral recovery of 23.2% of the viral titer after 24 hours in the presence of the bacteria compared to 0.7% in their absence (p = 0.001). This study shows complex interactions between viruses, oral bacteria, and fecal particles within the oral environment, emphasizing the need for further research on oral viral persistence and transmission dynamics. Understanding these mechanisms behind viral persistence in saliva can inform public health strategies aimed at mitigating the risk of transmission.</description>

We retrospectively reviewed HHT patients who underwent oral sclerotherapy between 2021 and 2024 at a tertiary academic center. Eleven patients (64% female, mean age 61.3 years, 82% ACVRL1 genotype) underwent sclerotherapy using a 1:4 mixture of 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate and air. Lesions treated included the lip (36%), tongue (36%), hard palate (18%), and gingiva (9%). Presenting symptoms included oral bleeding with eating and dietary limitations. Adverse effects included transient lip swelling (n = 2) and tongue burning (n = 1). At an average follow-up of 6 months, 10/11 patients with follow-up data had complete symptomatic and clinical resolution. Our findings suggest that oral sclerotherapy is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment for HHT-related oral bleeding that clinicians should consider.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Swisher AR, Hintze JM, Stucky CH, Cronin PA, Entezami P, Hinni ML, Chang BA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70081'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70081&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41451691/'&gt;41451691&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Intraoperative parathyroid hormone (ioPTH) monitoring is crucial during parathyroid surgery to ensure chemical cure. However, delays in processing can prolong operative times. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a checklist to expedite ioPTH assay processes. METHODS: A multidisciplinary checklist was developed to standardize ioPTH collection and workflow. Thirty patients treated with use of the checklist were prospectively studied, while 30 patients treated without use of the checklist were retrospectively reviewed. Time intervals for post-15-minute ioPTH assay results were compared. RESULTS: Thirty age- and sex-matched patients were included in each group (n = 60) involving 5 surgeons. The intervention and control group had a mean baseline PTH of 140.9 and 130.3 pg/mL and a post-15-minute ioPTH of 69.6 and 52.0 pg/mL, respectively. The mean time from sample collection to the post-15-minute ioPTH assay result was significantly reduced in the intervention as compared to the control group (22.2 vs 33.3 minutes; P &lt; .01). The proportional operative time spent awaiting ioPTH assay results was also reduced (24.4 vs 34.1%; P &lt; .01). In subgroup analysis, a significant difference in the total operative time was found in adenomatous disease (68.0 vs 92.2 minutes, P &lt; .05) but not four-gland hyperplasia (119.3 vs 142.3 minutes). DISCUSSION: The implementation of a simple intraoperative checklist effectively reduces the overall ioPTH assay processing time, creating a more efficient surgical workflow. It is low-cost and requires minimal additional resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This quality improvement intervention holds promise for broader adoption in parathyroid surgery to reduce delays and optimize patient care.</description>

This study aims to describe intraoperative methods for identifying the level of AC and to determine a safe inferior limit of thyroid cartilage excision during chondrolaryngoplasty. METHODS: Anterior thyroid cartilage length and anatomical AC position was measured in 105 transgender women who underwent feminization laryngoplasty [FemLar] between April 2022 and March 2025. In this retrospective review, 35/105 patients had a prior chondrolaryngoplasty performed elsewhere. The remaining 70 underwent FemLar for combined voice feminization and neck profile improvement. RESULTS: The AC was attached internally most commonly at 8 mm from the inferior thyroid border in (36%, 38/105), followed by 10 mm (25%, 26/105) and 9 mm (22%, 23/105). Among 70 patients without prior surgery, the AC was at the midpoint in 30%, 1 and 2 mm below midpoint in 43% and 19% respectively and 1 mm and 2 mm above the midpoint in 3% and 4% respectively. Vocal fold detachment was verified in 29% of patients with prior chondrolaryngoplasty where the cartilage had been removed to or inferior to the level of AC. CONCLUSION: The location of AC varies within a range of 2 mm above and below the midpoint or 6-10 mm from the inferior thyroid cartilage border. If not localizing the AC with endoscopy, a 2-3 mm safety margin above the estimated AC level should be considered during chondrolaryngoplasty.</description>

A majority of men who have sex with men (MSM) were using oral tablets; meanwhile alternative long-acting modalities have been and are being developed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of PrEP use and the preferences of potential long-acting PrEP in the MSM community in Hong Kong, an Asian Pacific city where free or subsidised PrEP is not available. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. Eligible participants were adult MSM without HIV infection who normally resided in Hong Kong. Historical and current PrEP use, and preferences of using long-acting injectable for PrEP were tested against sociodemographic and sexual behavioural factors using chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 437 responses collected, 17% had ever used PrEP and 16% were currently using PrEP. Current PrEP users were more likely to have a higher income level (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.11, p = 0.04), have engaged in chemsex (aOR 4.02, p &lt; 0.01), have a non-regular male sex partner (aOR 2.66, p = 0.02), have a male sex partner living with HIV (aOR 3.60, p &lt; 0.01), and be inclined to have condomless sex in the future (aOR 6.86, p &lt; 0.01). Among ever users, MSM who discontinued PrEP had a lower sexual risk than current users, such as recent history of chemsex (OR 0.22, p &lt; 0.01) and inclination to have condomless sex (OR 0.15, p &lt; 0.01). Long-acting injectables were accepted by 27% MSM, who were more likely to be current PrEP users (odds ratio [OR] 2.35, p &lt; 0.01), concerned about efficacy (OR 1.66, p = 0.03), and expecting to use PrEP for more than 2 years in the future (OR 9.69, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of PrEP among MSM indicated an increased awareness over the past decade. However, its promotion could have been hindered by the absence of a publicly funded or subsidised programme. While PrEP users had a higher sexual risk, the utilisation pattern would be affected by the dynamicity of sexual activities. Long-acting injectables had a moderate acceptance rate. Current PrEP users and those anticipated long-term users could be prioritised for its promotion.</description>

This study investigated the utility of Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS) analysis in evaluating spectral changes after EVFS, identifying spectral markers to better capture surgical and therapeutic effects on voice feminization. METHODS: Voice recordings were collected, and LTAS was analyzed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Spectral slope, Formant Cluster Prominence FCP [dB], and FCP (Hz) were examined across timepoints. At 12-months, transgender participants were compared to cisgender male and female control voices for reference. RESULTS: At 3 months, spectral energy increased in the higher frequency range, spectral slope flattened, and FCP [dB] was significantly reduced. By 12 months, spectral slope remained flatter than baseline, and FCP [dB] demonstrated a modest rebound, but remained below preoperative levels. Group comparisons demonstrated clear approximation of transgender women toward cisgender female spectral profiles at 12 months, with divergence from cisgender male patterns. LTAS parameters-including spectral slope and FCP [dB]-showed marked convergence with cisgender female characteristics. Importantly, sound pressure level (SPL) remained stable, suggesting spectral changes primarily reflected structural and behavioral adaptation rather than intensity. CONCLUSIONS: LTAS provides valuable insight into the spectral dynamics of voice feminization after EVFS beyond fo. Observed spectral changes over time suggest behavioral adaptation to surgical modification may extend for up to a year. Thus, LTAS emerges as a useful tool for monitoring recovery and adaptation.</description>

METHODS: The synthesized age-period-cohort prediction method is used for projection. RESULTS: Among men, mortality from oral, prostate, and kidney cancers would increase by 2050. Esophageal and brain cancers follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from most other cancers would decline. Lung (18.54 % of all cancer deaths), prostate (17.25 %), oral (15.10 %), colorectal (11.11 %), and liver (9.07 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in men by 2050, accounting for 71.08 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from bladder and kidney cancers would slightly increase. Among women, mortality from ovarian cancer would increase steadily. Pancreatic, breast, cervical, endometrial, bladder, and brain cancers would follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from other cancers would decline. Lung (13.63 %), breast (13.06 %), bladder (12.90 %), colorectal (12.81 %), and pancreatic (11.24 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in women by 2050, accounting for 63.65 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from ovarian cancer would increase from 3.57 % to 5.42 % (from 2023 to 2050). CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, prostate, pancreatic, endometrial, ovarian, and bladder cancers are projected to surpass their observation in past and may become new threat in future.</description>

His thyrotropin (TSH) worsened to &gt;100 mIU/L, caused by encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis that led to thyroxine malabsorption and enteral loss of protein-bound thyroxine. Several routes of levothyroxine were evaluated prior to subcutaneous levothyroxine. Methods: Subcutaneous levothyroxine was initiated at a low dose of 100 mcg thrice a week. A pharmacokinetic absorption study was performed to assess the bioavailability of subcutaneous levothyroxine against oral levothyroxine. Results: A 103% increase in free thyroxine at 6 hours post-subcutaneous levothyroxine 100 mcg confirmed effective absorption. Area-under-curve analysis showed that the relative bioavailability of subcutaneous levothyroxine was 8.75 times of oral levothyroxine for our patient. Hence, subcutaneous levothyroxine was initiated, with TSH normalizing 20 days later. Conclusions: Subcutaneous levothyroxine may be an alternative in patients with oral malabsorption.</description>

It is a deadly disease and is rarely cured when diagnosed at advanced stages. Early-stage disease is often curable, but clinicians and researchers have been stymied in their attempts to reliably screen for this disease, even in high-risk populations. Effective prevention of ovarian cancer is usually limited to the use of combined oral contraceptives and removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Methods and Results: We aim to review the current guidelines and the evidence reported for both the early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer. Novel imaging techniques, biomarkers, and surgical advances will be discussed. Conclusions: This review will offer (a) an understanding of the epidemiology of EOC (b) analysis and a discussion of relevant molecular markers that might be exploited for more accurate early detection (c) medical and surgical methods to prevent ovarian cancer.</description>

METHOD: This study retrospectively collected clinical data from treatment-naïve patients with unresectable T1-4N0-3M0 stage ESCC who underwent induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by radiotherapy at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between December 2021 and May 2024. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: the early radiotherapy cohort (early-RT, n=34), who initiated radiotherapy after completion of 1-2 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy, and the late radiotherapy cohort (late-RT, n=44), who initiated radiotherapy after completing 3-6 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with safety serving as the secondary endpoint. RESULT: With a cutoff date of May 31, 2025, the median follow-up duration was 25.9 months. In the overall population, the median PFS was 16.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7-20.3) and the median OS was 25.0 months (95%CI, 21.49-28.51). PFS was significantly longer in the early-RT cohort than in the late-RT cohort(20.4 vs. 13.7 months; HR = 0.53; p = 0.032). No statistically significant difference in OS was observed between the two cohorts (26.6 vs. 24.8 months; p = 0.728). Subsequent consolidative immunotherapy significantly improved PFS (median not reached [NR] vs. 12.8 months; HR = 0.46; p = 0.011) and OS (NR vs. 24.1 months; HR = 0.43; p = 0.017). In terms of safety, most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were manageable. The incidence of toxicities did not differ significantly between the early-RT and late-RT cohorts (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC, the combination of early radiotherapy intervention and subsequent consolidative immunotherapy may represent a potential preferred therapeutic strategy. The findings from this study provide a rationale for the design of phase III clinical trials.</description>

Standard hysterectomy may constitute overtreatment. Fertility-sparing approaches, oral or local progestins, hysteroscopic resection, and combined regimens are widely used, though evidence largely derives from early-stage carcinoma. Methods: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched from inception to 13 April 2025. Eligible studies included premenopausal women with AEH treated with oral progestins, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs), hysteroscopic resection, or combination regimens (e.g., oral progestins + metformin, LNG-IUD + GnRH analogues). Random-effects meta-analyses with multilevel modeling were applied. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB-2 and ROBINS-I; certainty of evidence was graded with GRADE-PRO. Results: Forty-nine studies (2313 women) were included. The pooled complete response (CR) rate was 85% (95% CI 80-89%). LNG-IUDs resulted in 88% CR and oral progestins in 80%. Combination therapies achieved up to 95% CR, though data were limited. Hysteroscopic resection combined with hormonal therapy reported high CR rates (96-97%) but relied on small, heterogeneous cohorts with uncertain reproducibility. The pooled recurrence rate was 19% (95% CI, 13-25%), lower with LNG-IUDs (14%) compared with oral progestins (22%). No response occurred in 14% overall and was lower with LNG-IUDs (13%) than oral progestins (19%). Among women attempting conception, the pooled pregnancy rate was 41%, and the live birth rate was 30%. The mean time to achieve CR was 5.6 months, whereas the mean time to recurrence was approximately 33 months. Conclusions: LNG-IUDs provide the most effective and well-supported fertility-sparing treatment for AEH, ensuring high remission with low recurrence. Despite favorable numerical outcomes, the evidence for hysteroscopic resection is limited and inconsistent, not supporting its routine use. Combination regimens may improve response but require confirmation in larger studies.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Uralov D, Harrington SR, Samarah H, Walia AS, Aweeda M, Mustafa MU, Kumar P, Briskin A, Jackson J, Mastrolonardo EV, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1720304'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1720304&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41450924/'&gt;41450924&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors, commonly prescribed for erectile dysfunction, may exhibit immunomodulatory properties by reducing myeloid-derived suppressor cell activity and enhancing T-cell responses. This study evaluated the association between PDE5 inhibitor use and overall survival (OS) in male-predominant solid organ malignancies. METHODS: Male-predominant solid tumors were identified using male-to-female incidence ratio ≥3:1 in SEER database: prostate, bladder, colon, esophageal, hypopharyngeal, laryngeal, tonsillar, and testicular cancers. Using the TriNetX Research Network, we compared male patients prescribed PDE5 inhibitors within 6 months of cancer diagnosis to those without PDE5 exposure. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed on demographic, clinical, and oncologic variables. OS was assessed in a combined pan-cancer cohort, stratified by overall stage, and subgroups of included cancers. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS from diagnosis. RESULTS: After PSM, 108,630 patients were included in each arm of the pan-cancer analysis. PDE5 inhibitor exposure was associated with significantly improved OS at 1, 3, and 5 years compared with controls (5-year OS 93.8% vs 86.6%; HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.41-0.44]). Stratified analyses demonstrated significantly improved OS across all four stages, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.57. Subgroup analyses by tumor site likewise showed statistically significant improvement in OS for every included cancer type, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: PDE5 inhibitor use was consistently associated with improved OS across all male-predominant cancers, including in stage-stratified analyses. These findings support further investigation into the potential role of PDE5 inhibitors in cancer outcomes.</description>

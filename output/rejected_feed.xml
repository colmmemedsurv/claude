      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ayele T, Birhanu M, Kassa S, Degualem SM, Wondmagegn H, Temesgen K, Bezie HE, Abayneh T, Gembe M, Andarge BD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0343208'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0343208&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41712573/'&gt;41712573&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Dehydration from diarrheal diseases remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Nasogastric tube is an easy, efficient, and cost-effective method of management that could be a key to minimizing deaths from diarrheal disease. As such, this study assessed the current practices and barriers toward using nasogastric tube for managing moderate to severe dehydration in under-five children. PURPOSE: To assess the practices and barriers toward the management of moderate to severe dehydration using nasogastric tube in under-five children among health centers in Gamo Zone, South Ethiopia. METHODS: A qualitative study design was conducted among healthcare professionals at selected health centers in Gamo Zone. Data about the practice pattern of managing moderate to severe dehydration and barriers toward nasogastric tube utilization were obtained via in-depth interview. Data were reviewed using constant comparative analysis to identify emerging themes, and axial coding was performed to make connections between categories to organize themes into causal relationships. Hypotheses and concepts were developed inductively from the data. RESULTS: In our study, of thirty participants, 21 (70.0%) correctly diagnosed severe dehydration, while 9 (30.0%) diagnosed moderate dehydration. Among those who diagnosed severe dehydration, 5 (23.8%) recommended intravenous resuscitation, and 16 (76.2%) chose oral rehydration. After being informed of failed attempts, four chose to refer, and one clinician remained fixed on intravenous resuscitation, while the remaining 16 clinicians opted for nasogastric tube. Major challenges mentioned by the participants in managing dehydration were late presentation of the patients and equipment shortage. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study were aware of the significance of nasogastric tube for the treatment of moderate to severe dehydration. However, a gap in clinical skills, a lack of continuous training, high clinician turnover, and institutional policies limiting nasogastric tube utilization for the management of dehydration were major challenges. Therefore, improving clinicians' skills through continuous training and improving management protocol is essential in ensuring safe and effective rehydration and better patient outcomes.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center and an affiliated private practice. METHODS: A retrospective review of Jaw-in-a-Day reconstructions performed between January 2023 and January 2024 was conducted. All patients undergoing fibula or scapula free flap reconstruction with immediate dental implantation and provisional prosthesis were included. Operative times and prosthetic workflows were compared by prosthesis capture method (in situ vs at the head) and team composition (single vs integrated two-surgeon teams). Outcomes measured were operative time, flap and implant survival, perioperative complications, Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) scores, and prosthesis use. RESULTS: 33 patients (median age 66; range 13-83) underwent Jaw-in-a-Day reconstruction, 20 malignant disease cases, and 13 benign or traumatic cases. Fibula free flaps were used in 32 cases and scapula in one. Median operative time was 12h19m. Prosthesis capture in situ trended toward shorter operative and prosthetic times but did not reach significance. The two-surgeon approach significantly reduced operative time by 4h24m (P &lt; .001) and prosthodontic time by 2 hours (P = .01). All flaps survived. Implant survival was 97%, with three failures in 2 patients. At 12 months, 32 patients used definitive prostheses and median FOIS was 7. CONCLUSION: The Jaw-in-a-Day surgical approach is feasible for benign and malignant reconstruction with high flap and implant survival. Early institutional adoption shows a learning curve, but efficiency improves with process refinements, particularly a two-surgeon workflow.</description>

In patients with cystinosis, cystine accumulates within lysosomes in all organs. The cystine-depleting agent cysteamine delays but does not prevent disease progression. METHODS: In this phase 1-2, open-label, ongoing clinical study, we performed a preliminary assessment of CTNS-RD-04, which consists of autologous CD34+ cells transduced with lentiviral vectors carrying CTNS complementary DNA, in patients with cystinosis. The primary end points were the safety and the side-effect profiles of CTNS-RD-04. Secondary end points were measures of efficacy, including white-cell cystine levels and cystine storage depletion. Oral cysteamine was withdrawn before CTNS-RD-04 infusion, and cysteamine eyedrops were withdrawn 1 month after myeloablation. RESULTS: Six participants (20 to 46 years of age) received CTNS-RD-04 and were followed for 29 to 63 months. CTNS-RD-04 doses ranged from 3.63×106 to 9.59×106 CD34+ cells per kilogram of body weight, and vector copy numbers ranged from 0.59 to 2.91 copies per diploid genome. All the patients had sustained and highly polyclonal hematopoietic reconstitution; vector copy numbers at 24 months ranged from 0.51 to 2.67 copies per diploid genome. A total of 217 adverse events occurred, most of which were mild or moderate in severity and largely consistent with the procedures and underlying disease. No evidence of monoclonal expansion was noted. White-cell cystine levels decreased from baseline except in Patient 4, who had the lowest vector copy number. CONCLUSIONS: In this small study, CTNS-RD-04, an ex vivo gene therapy for cystinosis, had adverse effects that were largely consistent with the myeloablative regimen and underlying disease profile. White-cell cystine levels decreased after therapy. (Funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03897361.).</description>

However, few studies have evaluated how embolization patterns and vascular features affect prognosis. METHODS: A 15-year retrospective review was performed on 44 patients with JNA undergoing surgery at one institution. Data included demographics, vascular supply, embolization techniques, surgical outcomes, and recurrence. RESULTS: Forty-three patients underwent PVE. Most tumors were embolized transarterially (93.0%) using polyvinyl alcohol-based agents (79.1%). The internal maxillary artery was most commonly embolized (93.0%). Internal carotid artery supply was present in 34.9%, and more than two vessels were embolized in 23.3%. Postembolization tumor blush occurred in 60.5%, with a median of 5% of the pre-embolization blush remaining after embolization. Neither internal carotid involvement, number of vessels embolized, nor residual blush significantly impacted operative time, surgical outcomes, or recurrence. CONCLUSION: With effective embolization, vascular complexity might not affect JNA resection outcomes. Multicenter studies are required to confirm those findings.</description>

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) measures SDoH based on 16 social factors. This study evaluates the impact of social vulnerability on the quality of life of those living with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS: A retrospective cohort review of 657 patients at a single institution. CRS patients with cystic fibrosis, nasal obstruction, and nasal cancer were excluded. Baseline covariates, including SNOT-22 scores, sex, and history of surgery, were collected. SVI was calculated using the National Social Vulnerability Index 2020 Database by Census Tract. Statistical analyses were conducted. RESULTS: A lower SVI score was associated with lower SNOT-22 scores, independent of sex, presence of polyps, or history of surgery (p &lt; 0.001). Patients in the "Low to Medium" SVI category were significantly less likely to undergo surgery compared to those in other SVI categories (p = 0.04). Compared to patients with CRSwNP, those with CRSsNP had significantly worse SNOT-22 scores (p = 0.038) but no significant difference in SVI scores. Surgery was performed in 69% of patients with CRSsNP and 84% of those with CRSwNP. CONCLUSION: Social vulnerability impacts the likelihood of surgery and quality of life in patients with CRS. Higher vulnerability is associated with worse sinonasal symptoms, regardless of confounders. CRS patients with lower social vulnerability are less likely to have surgery. SNOT-22 scores did not influence the likelihood of surgery.</description>

Here we conducted an epidemiological and laboratory investigation to determine the etiology of the outbreak. Clinical data and specimens were prospectively collected from 108 individuals, of whom 59/108 (54.6%) were female. Children aged &lt;5 years were the most affected (47/108, 43.5%); 14/32 (43.7%) were malnourished. Oro/nasopharyngeal swabs from 96/108 individuals were PCR tested; 26 blood samples were sequenced. Plasmodium falciparum was detected in 56/108 (51.8%) individuals. Co-infections were also detected, with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in 16/56 (28.6%) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in 10/56 (17.9%) individuals. No novel pathogens were detected via metagenomics. Our findings suggest that the outbreak was primarily associated with a surge in malaria cases, with concurrent viral respiratory infections. Increasing decentralized laboratory capacity and strengthening broader health systems remain crucial for faster outbreak detection and investigation.</description>

However, the failure to accurately recognize an oral potentially malignant disorder (OPMD) or the misdiagnosis of a benign lesion can lead to diagnostic delays with significant impact on the patient's health. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of clinical diagnosis compared to the histopathological diagnosis, focusing on OPMDs and suspected benign lesions in an Italian university hospital. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with a clinical diagnosis of benign lesions or OPMDs at the Oral Medicine and Pathology Unit (Maggiore Hospital, Trieste, Italy). Expert clinicians performed the clinical assessment, followed by biopsy and histopathological analysis. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated through sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Cohen's kappa (κ) coefficient was used to determine concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses. RESULTS: The histopathological analysis diagnosed the presence of benign lesions in 74.7% of cases and OPMDs in 25.3%. Sensitivity was highest for odontogenic cysts and tumors (92.06%) and lowest for ulcerative lesions/TUGSE (37.50%). Specificity exceeded 95% across most considered categories. The overall concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses was substantial (κ = 0.70). CONCLUSION: The misdiagnosis of OPMDs or benign lesions leads to diagnostic delays which seriously impact on the patient's therapeutic process. This survey highlights both high diagnostic accuracy and strong concordance between clinical and histological diagnoses. Integrating advanced diagnostic tools and constant clinicians' training is essential to minimize misdiagnoses.</description>

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized trial involving persons with HIV who had inadequate adherence to ART (a persistent HIV-1 RNA level of &gt;200 copies per milliliter or loss to follow-up). Participants received up to 24 weeks of adherence support, conditional economic incentives, and standard care with oral ART (step 1). Participants who had an HIV-1 RNA level of 200 copies per milliliter or lower in step 1 were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either continue standard care or switch to monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine with or without oral lead-in therapy (step 2). The primary outcome was regimen failure, defined as confirmed virologic failure (two consecutive HIV-1 RNA measurements of &gt;200 copies per milliliter) or treatment discontinuation during step 2. RESULTS: In step 1 of the trial, we enrolled 453 participants; the median age was 40 years, 63% were Black, and 29% had been assigned female sex at birth. In step 2, a total of 306 participants underwent randomization; 152 were assigned to receive cabotegravir-rilpivirine and 154 to receive standard care. Step 2 randomization was stopped early on the basis of the superiority of cabotegravir-rilpivirine to standard care in secondary outcomes at a prespecified analysis performed after a median follow-up of 48 weeks. The cumulative incidence of regimen failure by week 48 was 22.8% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 41.2% in the standard-care group (difference, -18.4 percentage points; 98.4% confidence interval [CI], -32.4 to -4.3; P = 0.002). The cumulative incidence of an adverse event was 43.5% in the cabotegravir-rilpivirine group and 42.4% in the standard-care group (difference, 1.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -12.7 to 15.0). Resistance-associated mutations developed in 2 participants with confirmed virologic failure in each group. CONCLUSIONS: Monthly injections of long-acting cabotegravir-rilpivirine were superior to standard oral ART in reducing the risk of regimen failure among persons with HIV who had adherence challenges.

This study aimed to investigate prophylactic effects of naldemedine on OINV in patients initiating regular, oral, strong opioids for cancer pain. METHODS: In this preplanned secondary analysis of a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial investigating the preventive effects of naldemedine on OIC, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either naldemedine 0.2 mg or placebo once daily for 14 days. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate, defined as the proportion of patients with no vomiting episodes and no use of rescue antiemetics within the first three days of opioid initiation. The secondary endpoint was the nausea and vomiting score of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 Palliative Care (EORTC QLQ-C15-PAL). RESULTS: Of the 103 patients, 48 and 47 patients in each group started protocol treatment, respectively. The CR rate was significantly higher in the naldemedine group than in the placebo group (81.3% vs. 38.3%, P &lt; 0.001). Nausea and vomiting scores on the QLQ-C15-PAL at weeks 1 and 2 were significantly better in the naldemedine group (means 7.1 and 6.4) versus placebo (means 44.6 and 35.3; both P&lt;.001). Within the total effect of naldemedine on the QLQ-C15-PAL nausea and vomiting scores at week 2, the proportion mediated through OIC reduction was 21.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Naldemedine may have intrinsic antiemetic potency to prevent both OIC and OINV.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between sarcopenia risk, handgrip strength, and swallowing function in patients with dysphagia undergoing Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A tertiary dysphagia clinic. METHODS: Medical records of individuals aged 65 years and older who attended the dysphagia clinic over a 6-month period were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, clinical symptoms, handgrip strength, SARC-F (Strength, Assistance in walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, and Falls) scores, Penetration Aspiration Scale (PAS) scores, and Yale residue scale scores from FEES. Critically weak grip strength was defined using previously established thresholds. Correlations between sarcopenia indicators and swallowing outcomes were analyzed using Spearman's rho. RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included (mean age 77.6 ± 7.5 years; 52% male). Twenty-five (76%) demonstrated critically weak grip strength, and 9 (27%) had SARC-F ≥ 4, indicating sarcopenia risk. SARC-F scores were negatively correlated with Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) (rs = -0.45, P = .01) and positively correlated with liquid PAS (rs = 0.41, P = .02). Handgrip strength was negatively correlated with age (rs = -0.39, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Most older adults undergoing FEES exhibited critically weak grip strength, suggesting high sarcopenia risk. Higher sarcopenia risk correlated with worse swallowing safety and reduced oral intake. These findings highlight the importance of assessing and addressing nutritional and muscle strength deficits in dysphagic older adults.</description>

This trial compared two commonly used radiation dose regimens in nCRT for resectable thoracic ESCC. METHODS: This single-center, phase II prospective randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with locally advanced thoracic ESCC from February 22, 2018 to February 22, 2021. Patient were randomized 1:1 to receive nCRT with either 50.4Gy/28F or 41.4Gy/23F, concurrent with weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin. The primary endpoint was 2-year progression free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 147 patients were randomized (50.4 Gy, n=72; 41.4 Gy, n=75), of whom 101 underwent surgical resection., Pathological complete response occurred in 23 of 46 patients (50.0%) in the 50.4-Gy group and 18 of 55 patients (32.7%) in the 41.4-Gy group (p=0.078). Using major pathological response (MPR) as an alternative endpoint, the 50.4Gy/28F regimen significantly increased the MPR rate to 73.9%, compared to 52.7% in the low-dose group (p=0.029). In the intention-to-treat population analysis, the 2-year PFS rates were 56.7% for the high-dose group and 49.3% for the low-dose group, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.46-1.11, p=0.14). Two-year OS rates were similar between groups. Grade ≥2 radiation esophagitis occurred more frequently in the 50.4-Gy group, while postoperative complication rates were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Dose escalation from 41.4 to 50.4 Gy in nCRT for resectable ESCC did not improve PFS or OS but was associated with a higher MPR rate and increased esophagitis. These findings support current evidence that routine dose escalation does not confer a survival advantage, while providing randomized ESCC-specific data to inform individualized treatment decisions.</description>

In Egypt, where cultural and religious norms shape health perceptions, HPV prevention, especially vaccination, remains a critical public health issue. This study investigates parental knowledge and attitudes towards HPV infection and vaccination in Egypt, focusing on the influence of cultural and religious beliefs. METHODS: A national cross-sectional survey was conducted from January to April 2024 among 776 Egyptian parents. Participants were recruited using convenience and snowball sampling methods. A comprehensive questionnaire, translated and validated in Arabic, assessed knowledge about HPV and cervical cancer, beliefs about HPV vaccination, and vaccine acceptability. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 28, applying non-parametric tests to examine associations between demographic factors and study outcomes. RESULTS: While 38.5% of parents had heard of HPV, only 26.2% knew about the HPV vaccine. Higher education levels and income were significantly associated with better knowledge of HPV transmission and its link to cervical cancer. Cultural and religious factors played a pivotal role in shaping beliefs, with older and less educated parents showing lower levels of vaccine acceptance. Mothers were more willing than fathers to vaccinate themselves and their daughters, with willingness influenced by gender, age, and income. CONCLUSION: Parental awareness of HPV and its vaccine remains low in Egypt, with significant cultural and religious influences on health beliefs and behaviors. Tailored public health interventions addressing these factors are needed to improve HPV vaccine uptake and reduce the burden of HPV-related diseases in Egypt.</description>

We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate triage of women who are HPV-positive using dual stain (DS) and HPV genotyping. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included 9,645 consecutive women who are HPV-positive undergoing cervical screening in two periods between 2015 and 2017 in the organized cervical screening program at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Absolute risk and clinical performance of DS and cytology for detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 and greater (CIN3+) were estimated overall and by HPV genotype and by age. Cumulative absolute risk of CIN3+ was modeled over 5 years using a prevalence-incidence mixture model, which allows estimating risk accounting for differences in disease ascertainment, surveillance intervals, and compliance. RESULTS: The baseline risk of CIN3+ was 9.4% and 0.8% for women testing positive and negative for DS, respectively, and 6.9% and 2.0% for women testing positive and negative for cytology, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for CIN3+ detection were better for DS compared with cytology over 5 years (P &lt; .001 for all comparisons). Risk in women with HPV16-positive/negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy was substantially higher than the risk in women with HPV16-positive/DS-negative (7.5% v 2.9%, P &lt; .001). DS had better triage performance compared with cytology in all age groups and in women positive for HPV types other than HPV16 or HPV18. CONCLUSION: Long-term reassurance of low risk among DS negatives suggests that DS detects molecular changes earlier in the carcinogenic pathway than cytology. DS has better risk stratification than cytology overall, within HPV risk strata, and across all screening age groups and is a better option for triage of vaccinated populations.</description>

Still, hospitalization cannot be avoided in a substantial portion of patients and potential predictors of HF hospitalization (HFH) are eagerly awaited. AIM: We aimed to identify predictors of HFH after outpatient IV diuretic treatment for WHF, in order to improve the selection of patients who qualify for successful outpatient IV diuretic treatment. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied WHF patients receiving intravenous diuretics in an outpatient day-care setting in one of two Dutch hospitals. A total of 366 patients from hospital A were used to identify predictors of 30-day HF (re-)hospitalization (HFH), which occurred in 88 (24.0%). Mean age was 76 years, 57% were male and 49% had ejection fraction below 40%. Age, eGFR, NT-proBNP, sodium, and haemoglobin were identified as predictors of HFH. The multivariable logistic regression model containing these factors had acceptable calibration and discrimination (AUC 0.73). The performance of the model was less favorable in the 127 patients from hospital B (29 patients with 30-day HFH), with AUC 0.65 and suboptimal calibration, indicating overestimation of risk. Doubling of NT-proBNP plasma levels and higher ambulatory oral loop diuretic dosages were strong predictors of mortality and HFH at 6 months in hospital A. CONCLUSION: In patients with WHF receiving outpatient day-care intravenous diuretic treatment, age, eGFR, NT-proBNP, sodium and haemoglobin predicted 30-day HFH. These factors may guide decisions on day-care treatment versus hospitalization, but require further validation Fig 2.</description>

However, the optimal therapeutic parameters remain undefined. This prospective study aimed to compare the efficacy of two distinct intralesional bevacizumab administration protocols following surgical resection of RRP. METHODS: Between 15/09/2023 and 31/12/2024, adult patients with RRP were enrolled in a prospective research study. Participants were allocated to one of two bevacizumab administration protocols, delivered intralesional during direct microlaryngoscopy and CO₂ laser excision. Disease severity was assessed using the Derkay, Dikkers and Numerical scoring systems, as well as the Voice Handicap Index (VHI), at baseline and at 8-week intervals. RESULTS: Both treatment regimens were associated with reduction in disease burden and improved voice outcomes. No statistically significant differences in disease control were observed between the two administration protocols. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that both dosing regimens of bevacizumab were effective as an adjunctive therapy of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. The higher intralesional doses of bevacizumab are relatively safe and well tolerated in adult patients with laryngeal RRP. Further studies with extended follow-up are warranted to define long-term efficacy and optimal dosing strategies.</description>

This study examined whether the number of remaining teeth mediates the association between age and oropharyngeal dysphagia (OD) risk. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 413 community-dwelling older adults (≥ 60 years) recruited from community health centers in Sulawesi, Indonesia. OD risk was assessed using a validated screening questionnaire. Oral examinations were conducted by trained nurses. Mediation analysis estimated the indirect, direct, and total effects of age on OD risk, adjusting for sex, educational level, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: Participants' mean age was 69.9 years, with 15.3 remaining teeth. Mediation analysis revealed a significant indirect association between age and OD risk, mediated through the number of remaining teeth (adjusted β = 0.076, 95% CI: 0.034-0.114, p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the direct effect of age was not statistically significant. The total effect of age on OD risk remained significant. CONCLUSION: The number of remaining teeth statistically mediated the association between age and OD risk. Although causal inference is limited by the cross-sectional design, these findings highlight oral health as a potentially modifiable factor for reducing OD risk among older adults.</description>

However, data on the cost of cancer is scarce. This study estimated National Health Service (NHS) hospital care costs for eight cancer types by stage at diagnosis in England. METHODS: This national, retrospective, population-based cohort study used individual patient-level data collated by the National Disease Registration Service, NHS England. We included patients aged 50-79 years who were diagnosed with a colorectal, head and neck, liver and bile duct, lung, lymphoma, oesophageal, ovarian, or pancreatic cancer in England between Jan 1, 2014, and Dec 31, 2017. For each patient, we obtained linked national health-care records, incorporating all inpatient hospital care, outpatient activity, and accident and emergency department attendances, and costed these using a payer perspective. Patients were excluded if registration was death certificate only, records related only to a secondary metastatic site, sex and cancer type were incompatible, death status or date were uncertain, or there were zero health-care costs from 6 months before diagnosis to end of follow-up. Net, cancer-related, regression-adjusted hospital care costs were reported for each cancer type and stage overall, annually, and by phase of care. Within each annual period and phase, mean monthly costs were also estimated. FINDINGS: Of 359 106 cancer records registered, 345 629 cancers were available for analysis, and 333 657 cancers were included in the analysis (147 334 [44·2%] occurred in female patients and 186 323 [55·8%] in male patients; 303 227 [90·9%] among participants of White ethnicity, 4452 [1·3%] among participants of mixed or other ethnicity, 7870 [2·3%] among participants of Asian ethnicity, 4179 [1·3%] among participants of Black ethnicity, and 13 929 [4·2%] among participants of unknown ethnicity). Overall costs were higher at later stages for colorectal, head and neck, lymphoma, and ovarian cancers with mean stage IV costs of £37 838, £36 657, £42 667, and £45 871, respectively. Costs for liver and bile duct, lung, oesophageal, and pancreatic cancers were highest for those diagnosed at stage II (£28 356, £29 553, £33 640, and £39 351, respectively), and slightly lower at stages I, III, and IV. Health-care costs were highest in the initial treatment and the end-of-life phases of care. Within each phase, mean cost per month increased with stage for most cancer types studied, though fewer months of follow-up were observed in each phase for liver and bile duct, lung, oesophageal, and pancreatic cancers. INTERPRETATION: Cancer-related NHS hospital care costs by stage at diagnosis differed between cancer types; this heterogeneous pattern could inform detailed and nuanced economic evaluations of early detection initiatives.

Infant movement may also prolong the procedure. Automated computer vision (CV) assessment of video nasolaryngoscopy may improve diagnostic accuracy, shorten procedure time, and reduce infant discomfort. The aim was to develop a CV model to segment laryngeal anatomy, differentiate between normal and laryngomalacia cases, and classify laryngomalacia type (1, 2, or 3). METHODS: A total of 241 pediatric nasolaryngoscopy videos were obtained from The Hospital for Sick Children between August 2023 and March 2025 from participants &lt; 1 year old. Videos were annotated and randomly assigned to a training set [192 (80%)] and testing set [49 (20%)]. Three binary classification models (fine-tuned for feature extraction) were developed to predict laryngomalacia and classify its type. CV predictions were compared with diagnoses made by three staff otolaryngologists. RESULTS: The CV model's Dice similarity coefficient for laryngeal anatomy segmentation was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85-0.88). The model differentiated normal from laryngomalacia cases with an accuracy of 0.90 and predicted type 1 and type 2 laryngomalacia with accuracies of 0.86 and 0.90, respectively. A type 3 model was not developed due to insufficient cases. CONCLUSION: The CV model successfully segmented laryngeal anatomy, differentiated normal from laryngomalacia cases, and classified type 1 and 2 laryngomalacia from pediatric video nasolaryngoscopy. With dataset expansion, further algorithm refinement, and external validation, this model may serve as a clinical decision support tool in the future.</description>

We aim to systematically review and synthesize the clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of ENA-SNT. METHODS: This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines. A literature search was conducted across major databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Articles that reported ENA-SNT cases in humans were eligible for inclusion. Data extraction and quality assessment were independently performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 145 studies were included, comprising 163 patients. The mean age was 28.8 years (range, 0-78), with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The nasal septum (33.3%), inferior turbinate (16.6%), and maxillary sinus (16.0%) were the most frequent tumor sites. Common symptoms included nasal obstruction (73.0%) and epistaxis (68.1%), often in combination (55.2%). Angiography demonstrated no hypervascularity in 23.1% of cases; when present, the internal maxillary artery supplied the tumor in 96.1%. Preoperative biopsy caused brisk bleeding in 44.5%. Surgery was the primary treatment in 94.4% of cases, with a recurrence rate of 5.3% and an average time to recurrence of 3.8 months. Intracranial and orbital involvement were rare: 1.84% and 2.45%, respectively. CONCLUSION: This review supports ENA-SNT as a clinical entity distinct from juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Symptoms develop more rapidly, but the tumor is less aggressive, less vascularized, and has a better prognosis. ENA-SNT can occur across all age groups and in female individuals. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, with low recurrence rates.</description>

Additionally, it seeks to develop a multi-indicator-based diagnostic model to provide a scientific basis for early diagnosis and treatment. METHODS: A total of 126 subjects were included and divided into three groups according to the A/N ratio (Group A/N ≤ 0.6, Physiological group 0.61 ≤ A/N ≤ 0.7, Pathological group A/N ≥ 0.71).The study compared the mandibular, two-dimensional airway and three-dimensional airway indicators among the three groups and combined stratified analysis with correlation analysis to identify the risk factors for adenoid hypertrophy. The effectiveness of the diagnostic model was verified using ROC curves, calibration curves and DCA decision curves. RESULTS: 1.There were no significant differences in gender distribution among the three groups (p = 0.404). However, the ANB angle (5.18 ± 2.06 vs.3.73 ± 3.09, p = 0.041) and Z-angle (63 ± 10 vs.57 ± 10, p = 0.014) were significantly higher in the pathological group. This suggests that adenoid hypertrophy may lead to mandibular retrognathia, which in turn may exacerbate Angle Class II malocclusion.2.Three-dimensional airway analysis revealed that the nasopharyngeal volume in the pathological group was 50% less than that in the control group (4,971 ± 1,803 mm3, p &lt; 0.001), confirming its mechanical compressive effect on the upper airway space.3.Age-stratified analysis indicated that in the control group, the U1-SN and U1-NA angles were significantly higher in the ≥ 11 -year- old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), reflecting physiological compensation. In the physiological group, the U1-SN angle was significantly higher in the 9-to-11-year-old subgroup than in other age groups (p = 0.036), but no difference was found in airway volume. In the pathological group, the Y-axis angle and MP-FH angle were significantly larger in the ≥ 11-year-old subgroup (p &lt; 0.05), implying that early surgical intervention may be necessary for this subgroup.4.A/N was significantly correlated with mandibular, two-dimensional and three-dimensional airway indicators (p &lt; 0.05). Among these, PNS-UPW was identified as an independent risk factor (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.36-0.74, p &lt; 0.001).5.The multi-indicator diagnostic model demonstrated an AUC of 0.950 (95% CI = 0.904-0.982).The calibration curve (Hosmer-Lemeshow test p &gt; 0.05) and DCA decision curve indicated that the model offered significantly higher net benefits than traditional strategies within the threshold probability range of 0.2-0.8. CONCLUSION: This study, leveraging multimodal data analysis, elucidates the pathological process by which adenoid hypertrophy affects dental and maxillofacial development via dual mechanisms of mechanical compression (airway narrowing) and functional compensation (mandibular retrognathia and abnormal tongue position).The developed diagnostic model serves as a quantification tool for the early identification of high-risk children, provides evidence-based support for determining the optimal timing of ENT surgery and designing orthodontic treatment plans, and is anticipated to enhance the precision and timeliness of children's maxillofacial health management.</description>

METHODS: TriNetX, a large international database of anonymized health records, was queried for adults with either positive or negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2024. Patients with cancer or immunodeficiency before the COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable exposure and control groups. Relative risk ratios and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis of CRS diagnosis were calculated 3 months after PCR testing. Sub-analyses were completed to investigate the effects of prior COVID-19 infection on subsequent CRS development stratified by prior vaccination status and by variant-dominant time periods (pre-Delta, Delta, and Omicron). RESULTS: Propensity score-matched COVID-19+ and COVID-19- cohorts each consisted of 2,135,446 patients. Rate of diagnosis of CRS increased following a positive COVID-19 PCR test (RR = 2.13, 95% CI [2.10-2.16]) and varied across variant-dominant periods, with risk ratios of 1.44 (95% CI [1.41-1.47]) during pre-Delta, 1.20 (95% CI [1.15-1.25]) during Delta, and 2.10 (95% CI [2.07-2.13]) during Omicron. Prior COVID-19 vaccination did not modify the risk of CRS among patients with a positive COVID-19 PCR (RR = 0.98, 95% CI [0.92-1.05]). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 infection was found to increase the risk of subsequent diagnosis of CRS. Further studies are needed to better understand the relationship between COVID-19 and the development of sinonasal inflammatory pathology.</description>

In this study, we examined the effect of implementation of a standardized post-operative tracheostomy decannulation protocol on our primary endpoint, return to the emergency room within 30 days for upper airway related issues, as well as on decannulation rates. We also examined the association between several patient/intervention characteristics and successful decannulation prior to discharge. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively for all patients who underwent free flap reconstruction requiring tracheostomy between September 2020 and October 2021 at a single tertiary center. A standardized protocol was implemented to determine candidacy for decannulation prior to discharge. Our protocol was two tiered with initial criteria including: tolerance of finger occlusion, passing of abbreviated fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES), requiring suction no more frequently than every 4 h, adequate cough, no supplemental oxygen requirements, and alert mental status. Patients meeting these criteria progressed to a 24-h capping trial. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 114 patients who underwent the decannulation protocol, as well as a retrospective control cohort of 96 patients from prior to protocol implementation for a total of 230 patients. Although not significant (p = 0.34), a higher proportion of our protocol cohort, 45/114 (39.5%) of patients decannulated before discharge versus 31/96 (32.3%) of our control patients. For our primary endpoint, only a single patient in the protocol cohort had a return to the ED within 30 days for upper airway related issues compared with 6 patients in the control cohort (0.9% vs. 6.2%; p = 0.048), and we found no significant difference in readmission rates. We also found that across both cohorts, patients with an anterior defect involving the genial tubercle had lower rates of decannulation vs. other patients (24.3% vs. 42.1%; p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a standardized protocol for post-operative head and neck reconstruction patients can give providers greater confidence in discerning which patients are appropriate for decannulation prior to discharge and prevent returns to the emergency room.</description>

METHODS: Seven patients with ADLD underwent DBS (GPi = 4; VIM = 3) surgery. Postoperative voice testing was performed after stable DBS programming. Primary outcome measures included tremor rate, extent of fundamental frequency/intensity modulation, percentage of voicing, duration/number of voice breaks, and cepstral peak prominence. Linear mixed effects models tested voice improvement after GPi and VIM surgery, with significance determined after controlling for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: GPi-DBS showed trends for improved percentage of voicing, duration of voice breaks, number of voice breaks, and extent of intensity modulation pre-post within-group with large effect size. VIM-DBS showed trends for improved tremor rate within-group with large effect size. Between-group comparison showed greater improvement in percentage voicing and extent of intensity modulation in patients with GPi-DBS compared to VIM-DBS, whereas tremor rate showed greater improvement after VIM-DBS compared to GPi-DBS. Duration of voice breaks showed more improvement in GPi than VIM but it did not achieve statistical significance after multiple comparison adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: Objective acoustic voice analyses provide preliminary, target-specific patterns that warrant confirmation of bilateral GPi-DBS for patients with ADLD and bilateral VIM-DBS for those with both ADLD and vocal tremor. Future research with larger sample sizes, along with investigations into the neuronal mechanisms underlying laryngeal neuromodulation, is needed to further evaluate the role of DBS in treating ADLD.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jafari M, Hosseini S, Taleei R, Saraei P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.042'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.042&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702442/'&gt;41702442&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Radiation-induced alopecia (RIA) is a common side effect of cranial and head-and-neck radiotherapy that can be temporary or permanent, depending on radiation dose and hair follicles to recover. Since RIA can impact patients' self-image and quality of life, establishing dose thresholds and prevention strategies are essential for patient counseling and treatment planning. METHODS: A PRISMA-guided systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central, including studies that reported RIA incidence, severity, persistence or scalp dose metrics in patients receiving external-beam radiotherapy. RESULTS: Fifteen studies (≈1,500 patients) were included, covering a range of techniques including photon-based modalities (3DCRT, IMRT, VMAT), proton therapy, hippocampus-sparing whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and scalp-avoidance approaches. Across modalities, near-maximum scalp dose (D2%) and volumetric parameters consistently correlated with RIA severity. Temporary RIA typically occurred at ∼20 Gy, whereas permanent RIA was observed at mean doses above 30 to 36 Gy or D2% doses approximately 45 to 50 Gy. Proton NTCP and gEUD models showed strong predictive performance (AUC 0.8 to 0.9) and external validity, supporting their use for real-time plan evaluation. Pediatric patients, especially those receiving craniospinal irradiation with intensive chemotherapy, experienced permanent RIA at lower dose thresholds (∼21 Gy). Technical strategies such as scalp-avoidance VMAT and hippocampus-sparing WBRT reduced scalp dose and preserved hair without compromising tumor control. Although patient-reported outcomes were infrequently assessed, available data consistently highlighted significant psychosocial impact and patient interest in restorative interventions. CONCLUSION: RIA is a reproducible, dose-dependent effect with well-defined scalp dose thresholds. Routine scalp contouring, minimizing near-maximum hotspots, and applying scalp-sparing techniques are feasible and clinically impactful strategies. Integration of NTCP modeling and standardized quality-of-life assessments offers personalized risk prediction, supports informed treatment decision-making, and improves survivorship care.</description>

Cabozantinib, an oral multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity as monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy in malignancies. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of cabozantinib and pembrolizumab for patients with aCM. METHODS: This phase 1b/2 study enrolled 28 patients with unresectable aCM. In phase 1b, escalating dose levels of cabozantinib (20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg) were administered concurrently with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks using a 3 + 3 design to determine recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). In phase 2, patients received cabozantinib at RP2D in combination with pembrolizumab using a Simon 2 stage design. Primary end point of phase 2 was overall response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included disease control rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Phase 1b enrolled eight patients, cabozantinib 40 mg daily dose level was selected as RP2D. Response rate in stage 1 exceeded predefined criteria for proceeding to expansion phase; however, phase 2 was terminated after 20 patients due to low accrual in the setting of evolving standard of care. Among all treated patients, the most common grade ≥3 toxicities were hypertension (n = 10, 36%), hypokalemia (n = 5, 18%), hypophosphatemia (n = 4, 14%), and ALT elevation (n = 4, 14%). Among 20 patients treated in phase 2, ORR was 45%, median PFS was 6.6 months, and median OS was 29.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Cabozantinib and pembrolizumab combination was explored in treatment-naive aCM. Toxicity was consistent with known profiles, but discontinuation rates were notable.</description>

Primarily, adherence to rest has been measured using patient reports, but their validity is unknown. Instrumental measures of rest adherence are uncommon. Furthermore, to our knowledge, subjectively and instrumentally measured voice rest has not been compared in voice patients. We aimed to compare patient-reported voice use (daily and overall schedules) to concurrent dosimeter readings in postsurgical patients prescribed complete or relative voice rest. METHOD: Sixteen women (M = 45.88 years, SD = 15.39, range: 21-69 years) and seven men (M = 46.43 years, SD = 13.43, range: 31-70 years) who underwent microflap phonosurgery for a primary benign vocal fold lesion were randomized to complete or relative rest, controlling for sex and lesion type. Postoperatively, they wore a VocaLog2 Vocal Activity Monitor for a 7-day voice rest period and used a visual analog scale to record daily and overall subjective adherence. Within-subjects (daily/overall report) and between-subjects (relative/complete rest) factors were compared using analysis of variance; dosimeter data were the outcome variable. RESULTS: For both groups, daily (F1,42 = 4.34, p = 0.04) and overall (F1,42 = 4.38, p = 0.04) subjective ratings significantly differed from dosimeter data. The least-squares-adjusted means indicated that both groups' subjective estimates were 79-83 standardized units lower than the instrumental data across both time points. CONCLUSION: Subjective patient reports of adherence should be carefully considered. The duration of voice use did not differ by the type of voice rest recommended.</description>

METHODS: A total of 107 patients (March 2023-March 2025) were assigned to a control group (n = 51, conventional antifungal therapy) or a study group (n = 57, hypericin + PDT). Post-treatment assessments included oral microbiota structure, α-diversity (Chao1, Shannon, Simpson), community differences (via PCoA and hierarchical clustering), and a mediation model to test C. albicans' role in lesion improvement. RESULTS: Chao1 (species richness) showed no significant difference, but the study group had lower Shannon/Simpson (microbial diversity). Opportunistic pathogens (e.g., C. albicans, Fusobacterium) decreased, while beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) increased. PCoA/clustering confirmed distinct community structures. C. albicans reduction mediated 53.1% of lesion size reduction (indirect effect = -2.656; 95% CI: 0.178-5.755). CONCLUSION: Hypericin + PDT effectively treats oral C. albicans infections safely. C. albicans is the core mediator for lesion area reduction, providing a basis for targeted clinical therapy.</description>

METHODS: An exhaustive literature search across international databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) was performed up to October 2025. Quality evaluation was conducted on the retrieved studies, literature management was performed using EndNote 21.3 (Clarivate Analytics, Philadelphia, PA, USA) and meta-analyses were executed using RevMan 5.4 (The Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK) and Stata 18.0 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA). RESULTS: Five studies were included in total, encompassing 465 participants. This meta-analysis of DIF positivity rates in tissues demonstrated significant differences with the following three antibodies between OLP and OLL: fibrin (Fib), IgA, IgM. The area under the curve (AUC) values of Fib and IgA indicated moderate diagnostic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analysis of five studies revealed that Fib, IgA, and IgM exhibited significantly higher positive rates in OLP than in OLL, indicating their promising potential for aiding the differential diagnosis of OLP. However, sole reliance on the positivity of a single antibody is insufficient for distinguishing OLP from OLL. Further research on the immunofluorescence patterns of these antibodies will help clarify the diagnostic criteria. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This report was preregistered on PROSPERO with the registration ID CRD420251088424; the registration form is provided in Appendix 1.</description>

Despite evidence-based recommendations for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat POI, prior studies have shown low HRT use among cervical cancer survivors, particularly those treated with radiation. This study evaluates the impact of practice quality improvement (PQI) initiative within a radiation oncology department on the rates of HRT prescriptions, POI documentation, and counseling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on premenopausal patients aged ≤50 years who received curative-intent radiation for cervical cancer at a single institution from 2018 - 2024. Rates of POI-related counseling and HRT prescriptions were evaluated before and after a PQI intervention targeting POI treatment. HRT prescriptions were stratified by physiologic sex steroid replacement regimens (PSSRR), defined as ≥0.1 mg/day transdermal or ≥2 mg oral 17β-estradiol, vs. other regimens, including oral contraceptives and non-replacement doses of physiologic sex steroid regimens. Binary outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: Sixty patients met inclusion criteria. Patients seen after PQI intervention implementation had 2.1 times higher odds of receiving any HRT prescription, PSSRR or non-PSSRR, than patient seen before PQI intervention implementation (OR = 2.09, p = 0.015). PSSRR prescriptions increased from 3.4% pre-intervention to 57.7% post-intervention, with 80.7% of patients seen by an advanced practice provider (APP) receiving PSSRR. POI documentation increased from 48.3% to 80.8%, and inclusion on the problem list increased from 6.9% to 34.6%. High-quality POI counseling improved from 6.9% to 44.2%, and high-quality HRT counseling improved from 0.0% to 46.2%. CONCLUSION: The radiation oncology department-based PQI initiative significantly improved documentation, counseling, and PSSRR prescriptions for cervical cancer survivors.</description>

Although typically presenting in childhood, TGDCs can remain asymptomatic and manifest later in life. Proper diagnosis is crucial to avoid unnecessary interventions and complications. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 26-year-old South Asian male who presented with a painless, fluctuant midline neck swelling that had progressively enlarged over the past few months. Clinical examination revealed a well-defined, mobile mass at the level of the hyoid bone that exhibited upward movement with tongue protrusion, a hallmark feature of TGDC. Ultrasound confirmed a cystic lesion, and fine-needle aspiration ruled out any malignant features. The patient underwent successful surgical excision via the Sistrunk procedure, which involves the removal of the cyst along with the central portion of the hyoid bone to minimize recurrence. Postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathology report revealed a unifocal tumor and after MDT's discussion total thyroidectomy was planned. Patient was asked to follow-up for radiation therapy afterwards. CONCLUSION: TGDCs can present at any age and should be considered in the evaluation of midline neck masses. A thorough clinical assessment, supported by imaging, is crucial for accurate diagnosis. The Sistrunk procedure remains the gold standard for treatment, significantly reducing the risk of recurrence. In cases with suspicious features or malignancy, total thyroidectomy may be necessary for complete disease management. Early identification and appropriate intervention improve patient outcomes.</description>

METHODS: Searches were performed in five electronic databases and gray literature. Studies involving patients undergoing any type of surgical excision of OL or PVL were included. Data extraction focused on surgical technique, margin size, method of margin delineation, and recurrence outcome. Margin size was categorized in centimeters. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included. More than half of the studies (54.9%) did not report the width of surgical margins. Among those that did, margins between &gt; 2 and &lt; 3 mm were the most frequently reported (19.7%). Notably, 94.5% of the studies did not specify the criteria used to determine the margin width. Furthermore, 76.9% failed to describe the method used to delineate lesion margins. High recurrence was observed in 15.1% of OL cases with surgical margins ≤ 2 mm and in 40% of PVL cases with margins &gt; 2 to ≤ 3 mm. Lesions with margins between 3 and 5 mm showed a lower recurrence rate. CONCLUSION: We identified a lack of standardization in the reporting of surgical margins. Excision with 5 mm of clinically healthy tissue should be considered the optimal approach for the surgical management.</description>

Matcha, a shade-grown green tea consumed as an ultra-fine powder, is rich in catechins that may inhibit the transport of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates such as nadolol. This study investigated the effects of administering single and multiple doses of matcha on the pharmacokinetics of nadolol in an in vivo animal model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 32) were randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 (negative control) was administered normal saline followed by a single oral dose of nadolol (10 mg/kg). Group 2 (matcha single-dose) was administered a single dose of matcha (250 mg/kg) whisked in normal saline, followed by nadolol (10 mg/kg) after 30 min. Group 3 (positive control) received itraconazole (50 mg/kg), followed by nadolol (10 mg/kg) after 30 min. Group 4 (matcha multiple-dose) received matcha (250 mg/kg daily for 21 days) before administering nadolol (10 mg/kg) on day 21. Blood samples were collected at 0, 0.33, 0.66, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 24 h. Nadolol concentrations in plasma were measured by a validated high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FL) method. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using the PK solver add-in for Microsoft Excel. To ensure quality control, caffeine, a key marker compound of matcha green tea, was quantified using HPLC with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). A single oral dosage of matcha (250 mg/kg) had no statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of nadolol compared to the control group (p &gt; .05). Although the multiple-dose matcha group showed an increase in Cmax (~45%), AUC0-t (~18%), and AUC0-∞ (~22%) for nadolol compared to the control group, these differences were not statistically significant (p &gt; .05). In contrast, the t½ (h) of nadolol increased significantly from 4.0 ± 1.6 in the control group to 7.7 ± 4.2 (p = .039) in the matcha multiple-dose group. Itraconazole co-administration significantly increased systemic exposure (AUC) of nadolol (p = .009), confirming the validity of the animal model. Caffeine, a key marker compound in matcha tea, was quantified at 4.18 ± 0.44% w/w of dry matcha tea powder, equivalent to 41.8 ± 4.4 mg/g. This is the first study to explore the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between matcha tea and nadolol. Single and multiple oral doses of matcha green tea had negligible effects on most pharmacokinetic parameters of nadolol, except for an increased half-life in the multiple-dose group. Further research is needed to establish the clinical relevance of this interaction before definitive recommendations on the safety of matcha tea and nadolol coadministration can be made.</description>

DATA SOURCES: The authors conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases, reported using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. REVIEW METHODS: Studies were included if they reported on rates of dental adherence among post-RT head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Data were extracted on rates of guideline adherence, dental health outcomes, barriers to care, and interventions. RESULTS: Twelve studies with a pooled sample size of 2925 patients met inclusion criteria. Adherence to post-RT dental guidelines ranged from 19% to 93%. Commonly reported barriers to adherence included lack of patient education, financial hardship, limited dental provider availability, access to health insurance, and poor care coordination. Facilitators of adherence included integrated survivorship clinics, pre-RT dental counseling, and structured follow-up programs. Interventions with multidisciplinary collaboration and streamlined referral processes showed promise in improving adherence rates. CONCLUSION: Adherence to dental guidelines post-RT is influenced by a combination of individual, provider, and systemic factors. While several interventions show potential, further research is needed to develop effective implementation strategies. Strengthening multidisciplinary communication, improving patient education, and implementing structured follow-up may enhance long-term oral health outcomes for HNC survivors.</description>

This study aimed to investigate the effects of hypoparathyroidism on salivary calcium levels, flow rate, and parotid gland structure, exploring the implications for oral health of this patient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Conducted as a case-control study between January and June 2024, our research included 86 participants: 43 with hypoparathyroidism and 43 in a healthy control group. We compared participants' salivary calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium levels alongside salivary gland ultrasonography features, sialometry results, and oral health questionnaire outcomes. RESULTS: Salivary calcium levels were significantly lower in the hypoPT group [5.43 (4.13-9.65) mg/dL] compared to the control group [7.06 (4.02-13.18) mg/dL] (p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences were observed in salivary phosphorus (p = 0.112) or magnesium (p = 0.938) levels. Despite similar parotid volumes, ultrasonography detected significantly higher prevalence of parenchymal heterogeneity in the hypoparathyroidism cohort (p = 0.025). Scores from the Multidisciplinary Salivary Gland Society questionnaire were significantly higher in the hypoparathyroidism group (p &lt; 0.05), while sialometry measurements were significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: These results collectively suggested that hypoPT is a clinical condition with demonstrable effects on both oral health and salivary gland functions.</description>

Our prior work established OLP-associated fibroblasts (OLP/AFs) in creating the inflammatory milieu, but their interaction with MAIT cells remains unexplored. This study aims to investigate how OLP/AFs interact with MAIT cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral mucosal samples from OLP patients and healthy controls were selected for flow cytometry to detect MAIT cells. MR1 expression on fibroblasts was quantified via RT-qPCR, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence. For functional assays, OLP/AFs were stimulated with formaldehyde-fixed Escherichia coli (E. coli) to induce MR1 surface expression, then co-cultured with PBMCs±anti-MR1 blocking antibody and evaluated the activation status of MAIT. RESULTS: MR1 expression and MR1+ fibroblast density were significantly elevated in OLP lesions compared to healthy controls. OLP/AFs demonstrated higher baseline MR1 expression than normal fibroblasts, which was further enhanced following E. coli stimulation. Co-culture of E. coli-stimulated OLP/AFs with peripheral blood mononuclear cells induced marked activation of MAIT cells. This was evidenced by significantly increased frequencies of CD69+ MAIT cells and elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic molecules. CONCLUSION: OLP/AFs activate MAIT cells via an MR1-dependent mechanism.</description>

METHODS: Recent studies and reviews on AMPK signaling, salivary gland pathology, and tissue regeneration were collected from PubMed, Medline, and Scopus databases. The evidence was synthesized to elucidate the regulatory functions of AMPK in SG injury and recovery. RESULTS: SG homeostasis relies on a balance between cell death and renewal, which is disrupted by severe damage. AMPK functions as a pivotal regulator in this process, promoting acinar cell survival, activating resident stem cells, inhibiting fibrosis, and modulating immune responses. AMPK activation attenuates inflammation and fibrogenesis, enhances tissue regeneration, and fosters a reparative immune microenvironment conducive to glandular recovery. CONCLUSION: AMPK serves as a central hub linking metabolic regulation, immune modulation, and tissue repair in SG disorders. Understanding its molecular mechanisms and optimizing AMPK activation strategies may provide novel therapeutic approaches to restore both function and structure in damaged salivary glands.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 326 final-year dental students from universities in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. Participants completed a structured, anonymous 35-item online questionnaire addressing demographic data, exposure to oral biopsy procedures, self-perceived knowledge and skills, and attitudes towards biopsy practice. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and the Wilcoxon test, with a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: Most students reported having received formal theoretical training in oral biopsy (89.9%). Only 53.4% had performed at least one biopsy during their undergraduate studies, with excisional biopsies being the most common. Despite a high level of agreement regarding the relevance of oral biopsy to clinical practice (p &lt; 0.001), students demonstrated low self-confidence in performing incisional and excisional biopsies (p &lt; 0.001 for both), particularly in lesions suspected of malignancy (p &lt; 0.001). Prior practical experience was significantly associated with higher levels of confidence and more favorable attitudes towards performing biopsies (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Oral biopsy training among Latin American dental students is heterogeneous and largely theoretical, with limited practical experience contributing to reduced diagnostic autonomy and clinical confidence.</description>

PURPOSE: The study's purpose was to estimate the frequency of intraoperative and postoperative complications and identify associated risk factors in external and internal maxillary sinus lift procedures. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study was conducted at the Department of Periodontology, Gulhane Faculty of Dentistry, University of Health Sciences. Adult patients requiring maxillary sinus floor elevation via internal or external approaches were included based on residual bone height and radiographic availability. Exclusion criteria comprised systemic conditions affecting bone healing, heavy smoking, a history of sinus surgery or radiotherapy, and incomplete clinical records. PREDICTOR/EXPOSURE/INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: The primary predictor variable was the sinus lift technique (internal vs external). Additional predictors included patient-related, sinus- and site-related, and procedure-related factors. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was the occurrence of surgery-related intraoperative or postoperative complications (yes/no). Secondary outcomes included the types and frequencies of complications according to surgical technique. COVARIATES: Not applicable. ANALYSES: Statistical analyses included χ2 tests, independent samples t tests, and binary logistic regression analyses to identify independent factors, with P &lt; .05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 144 subjects (mean age, 49.0 ± 10.9 years), of whom 56.9% (n = 82) were women. Internal sinus lift was performed in 60.4% (n = 87) and external sinus lift in 39.6% (n = 57), with no significant age difference between groups (P = .2). Most subjects were systemically healthy 70.1% (n = 101), not using regular medication 72.2% (n = 104), and nonsmokers 91.0% (n = 131). Implant placement was achieved in 61.4% (n = 35). Sinus septa were present in 11.8% (n = 17), sinus pathology in 14.6% (n = 21), and bruxism in 22.9% (n = 33). Internal sinus lift was associated with a significantly lower overall complication rate than the external approach (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Within the limitations of this retrospective study, internal sinus lift procedures were associated with fewer complications than external approaches, highlighting the importance of careful preoperative evaluation and appropriate technique selection.</description>

Methods: We conducted a narrative review combining descriptive analyses of European Cancer Information System (ECIS) outputs with evidence from the European Network of Cancer Registries (ENCR) Working Group on NMSC and from national reports. A targeted PubMed search (2015-2025) assessed scientific usage of European registry data. Results: Nearly 200 PBCRs operate across about 40 European countries, with heterogeneous structures and timeliness. The ECIS estimated 101,500 incident cutaneous melanomas (CM) in the European Union in 2022. Long-term data from Nordic countries show a tenfold increase in CM incidence over the last six decades, with recent plateauing in younger cohorts. NMSC registration remains inconsistent: some countries record both cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC), others record cSCC only, and several omit NMSC entirely. Consequently, Europe-wide NMSC figures are not available from the ECIS. Global estimates exclude BCC and understate the true burden, which is likely between 1 and 1.6 million incident cases annually in Europe. The PubMed search identified 538 European registry-based publications on skin cancer (2015-2025). Conclusions: Melanoma registration in Europe is robust, but NMSC remains under-registered. Priorities include harmonized definitions and counting rules, better integration of outpatient and pathology data, streamlined EU-level reporting, digital/AI-enabled case ascertainment, and sentinel regions to generate reliable NMSC estimates.</description>

It is unclear how cannabis exposure correlates with anesthetic requirements. PURPOSE: The primary purpose was to measure the association between cannabis exposure and total milligrams of propofol (TMP). The secondary purpose was to use cannabis exposure years (CEYs) and TMP for exposure risk stratification. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: The investigators conducted a prospective study with a sample of subjects &gt; 21 scheduled for third molar (M3) removal requiring at least one upper and lower M3 under IVGA between May 1, 2022, and February 28, 2023, at the University of Washington Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) clinic. Exclusion criteria were subjects &lt; 21, pregnant, previous substance use history, or who didn't qualify for IVGA. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was CEY, a continuous variable calculated by multiplying questionnaire responses for frequency (exposures per days, weeks, months, and years) and duration (weeks, months, and years). OUTCOME VARIABLE: The primary outcome variable was TMP (mg). Secondary outcome variables include stratifying cannabis exposure risk with TMP. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, American Society Anesthesiology (ASA) classification, tobacco use, weight, body mass index (BMI), Mallampati score, number of M3s removed, and anesthesia and procedure times. ANALYSES: Independent t test, Fisher exact test, Pearson correlation coefficients, multivariate linear regression, and regression decision tree analysis were used. P values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. RESULTS: The sample was composed of 49 subjects with a mean age of 26.7 ± 5.5 years, 30 (61.2%) females, 38 (77.6%) CUs, and mean CEY 55.6 ± 50.2. Bivariate analysis showed a nonsignificant correlation between CEY and TMP (r = 0.3, P = .07). After adjusting confounders, CEY was significantly associated with TMP (coefficient = 0.7, 95% CI: 0.07 to 1.25, P = .03). Regression decision tree analysis stratified cannabis exposure based on TMP into 3 groups: 1) high risk (≥2 to 3 years, multiple daily use), 2) moderate risk (&gt;2 to 3 years, infrequent use), and 3) low risk (&lt;2 to 3 years, infrequent use). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Subjects reporting cannabis exposure ≥ 2 to 3 years of use with multiple daily sessions can be considered high risk for increased TMP for M3 removal.</description>

This study explores the potential of photochemical tissue bonding (PTB), a light-activated technique that forms molecular crosslinks between collagen molecules, to seal a commercial nerve connector in place for IAN and LN nerve repair. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure and compare the repair strength of conventional suture and PTB repair in a nerve transection model. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This was an ex vivo study conducted on IAN and LN harvested from independently euthanized Yorkshire pigs. The nerves were transected and then repaired by a single operator at Massachusetts General Hospital. Both repair techniques were performed on nerves retrieved from the same donor animal to minimize variability. Intraoral PTB repair of both IAN and LN was also simulated in a euthanized swine model. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variable was the nerve repair technique. Transected IAN and LN nerves were repaired using 4 simple interrupted 10-0 polyamide monofilament sutures or photochemical crosslinked porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) (Axoguard Nerve Connector). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): The primary outcome variable was mechanical repair strength, measured as maximal load to failure and maximum stress at failure, using an ADMET mechanical microtester. COVARIATES: Nerve cross-sectional area was included as a covariate. ANALYSES: Paired t tests were used to compare maximal load to failure and maximum stress at failure between the 2 repair methods. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: A total of 14 nerves were repaired. The maximal load to failure was 2.76 ± 1.01 N and 0.39 ± 0.28 N for the PTB with porcine SIS conduits and suture repair groups, respectively (P = .0006). The maximum stress at failure was 0.490 ± 0.319 N/mm2 and 0.125 ± 0.181 N/mm2 for the PTB with porcine SIS conduits and suture repair groups, respectively (P = .0039). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this study suggest that photosealed porcine SIS across the transected nerve provides greater mechanical strength than that of suture repair alone. Given the known benefits of PTB, this technique has high potential to enhance and streamline nerve repair in oral and maxillofacial surgery.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Podemska E, Gostomczyk K, Jerka D, Borowczak J, Gagat M, Grzanka D, Durślewicz J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2026.1663235'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2026.1663235&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41704611/'&gt;41704611&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Despite advances in therapy, survival remains poor due to late diagnosis and treatment resistance. Identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers is essential to improve risk stratification and clinical outcomes. METHODS: MRPL23 expression was evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker in NSCLC using immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from 110 patients and mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Associations between MRPL23 expression and clinicopathological features, as well as overall survival, were analyzed using survival statistics. RESULTS: MRPL23 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues (p &lt; 0.0001), with particularly elevated levels observed in squamous cell carcinoma. High MRPL23 protein expression was detected in 57 of 110 cases (51.8%) and was associated with shorter overall survival (median OS 34 vs. 48 months; HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.58, p = 0.04). These findings were validated in the TCGA cohort, where high MRPL23 mRNA expression correlated with worse overall survival (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17-1.83, p &lt; 0.01). DISCUSSION: MRPL23 overexpression, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. These results suggest that MRPL23 represents a promising biomarker for improving risk stratification and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies in patients with NSCLC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rees-Punia E, Teras LR, Newton CC, Moore SC, Lee IM, Bates-Fraser L, Chiang KE, Bloodworth DE, Eliassen AH, Mucci L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56971'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.56971&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701497/'&gt;41701497&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether physical activity lengthens survival among people with a history of cancers less commonly studied for such benefit. OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between physical activity assessed after a cancer diagnosis with cancer mortality and, secondarily, changes in physical activity before vs after diagnosis with cancer mortality among people previously diagnosed with 1 of 7 cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used a pooled dataset of 6 cohorts (Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Women's Health Study). Participants were survivors of bladder, endometrial, kidney, lung, oral cavity, ovarian, or rectal cancer who had completed surveys and had repeated measures of leisure-time physical activity. Baseline data were collected from 1976 through 1997. The mean (SD) follow-up was 10.9 (7.0) years. Data were analyzed from June 2023 to March 2024. EXPOSURES: Leisure-time moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) before and after cancer diagnosis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of MVPA in categories of metabolic equivalents of task hours per week (MET-h/wk) measured before and a mean (SD) of 2.8 (1.5) years after cancer diagnosis with cancer mortality. RESULTS: This pooled analysis included 17 141 cancer survivors (mean [SD] age, 67 [8] years; 60% female). Engagement in low amounts of MVPA (&gt;0 to &lt;7.5 vs 0 MET-h/wk) was associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among survivors who had been diagnosed with bladder (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67 [95% CI, 0.50-0.91]), endometrial (HR, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.45-0.87]), and lung cancer (HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.43-0.75]). Doubling the recommended MVPA guideline or more (eg, &gt;15 vs 0 MET-h/wk) was associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among oral (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.15-0.99] for &gt;22.5 to 30.0 MET-h/wk) and rectal (HR, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.33-0.97] for &gt;15.0 to 22.5 MET-h/wk) cancer survivors. Point estimates were less than 1 for cancer mortality among kidney cancer survivors (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.22-1.18] for &gt;15.0 to 22.5 MET-h/wk), although the confidence interval included the null. Compared with survivors who did not meet the MVPA guidelines before or after diagnosis, lung (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.47-0.71]) and rectal (HR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.32-0.83]) cancer survivors who met guidelines after diagnosis had a lower risk of cancer mortality, even if they were inactive before their diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this analysis of 6 pooled cohorts, higher levels of MVPA after a cancer diagnosis were associated with lower risk of cancer mortality among people previously diagnosed with 1 of 7 cancers not commonly studied for their association with MVPA. Findings suggest that it is important for health care professionals to promote physical activity for longevity and overall health among people living with and beyond cancer.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To analyze new skin cancers in participants with high-risk stage II melanoma treated with adjuvant pembrolizumab or placebo. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The multicenter double-blind, phase 3 KEYNOTE-716 randomized clinical trial enrolled 976 participants 12 years or older with completely resected stage IIB or IIC cutaneous melanoma between September 23, 2018, and November 4, 2020. Follow-up was completed on February 16, 2024. This analysis was not prespecified in the trial protocol. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive intravenous pembrolizumab, 200 mg (2 mg/kg for pediatric participants), or placebo, every 3 weeks for no more than 17 cycles. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Secondary analyses of incidence and time to diagnosis of new melanoma or other cutaneous malignant neoplasm, sensitivity analysis of recurrence-free survival (RFS) with new primary melanoma counted as an event, and incidence of immune-mediated severe skin reactions. RESULTS: A total of 976 participants were assigned to treatment (487 to pembrolizumab and 489 to placebo), of whom 589 (60.3%) were male (median age at diagnosis, 61 [IQR, 52-69] years). The median follow-up was 52.8 (range, 39.4-64.8) months. In the pembrolizumab group, 37 participants (7.6%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 168.0 [range, 1.0-1182.0] days); 12 (2.5%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 6 (1.2%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 19 (3.9%) had basal cell carcinoma (BCC), and 9 (1.8%) had cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). In the placebo group, 56 participants (11.5%) were diagnosed with new skin cancers (median time to diagnosis, 177.0 [range, 1.0-1043.0] days); 9 (1.8%) had new invasive primary melanoma, 9 (1.8%) had new primary melanoma in situ, 26 (5.3%) had BCC, and 17 (3.5%) had cSCC. Median RFS with new primary melanoma counted as an event was not reached with pembrolizumab and was 59.2 months (95% CI, 53.9 months to not reached) with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.52-0.80); 48-month RFS was 68.7% and 56.5%, respectively. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred in 16 of 483 participants (3.3%) in the pembrolizumab group and 3 of 486 (0.6%) in the placebo group (grade 3 or 4: 14 [2.9%] vs 3 [0.6%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the incidence of new primary melanoma was not different between groups, whereas nonmelanoma skin cancers were more common with placebo. The RFS benefit of pembrolizumab remained after accounting for new primary melanomas. Immune-mediated severe skin reactions occurred infrequently and were manageable. These findings support the use of adjuvant pembrolizumab in high-risk stage II melanoma. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03553836.</description>

Effective treatments addressing these determinants are needed. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether enhanced group prenatal care (eGPC) outperforms enhanced individual prenatal care (eIPC) for reducing perinatal depressive symptoms. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conduced in 10 Medicaid-serving clinics in California's San Joaquin Valley, enrolling English- or Spanish-speaking Medicaid-eligible pregnant individuals at less than 25 weeks' gestation, from November 2019 to January 2024, with 2 follow-up surveys through 12 weeks postpartum. Analyses were conducted as intention-to-treat. Data were analyzed from December 2024 to December 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomized to eIPC or eGPC. eIPC enhancements included assessments tailored to individual psychosocial, clinical, oral health, and substance use needs. eGPC enhancements included childcare, perinatal mental health screening and referral, transportation stipends, free groceries, and information on community resources. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was depression, operationalized as change in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores from baseline to 3 months postpartum. Outcomes were assessed by masked assessors. RESULTS: Of 1663 individuals assessed, 678 were enrolled and randomized; 4 withdrew consent, yielding an analyzed sample of 674 participants (mean [SD] age, 27.0 [5.8] years), including 50 African American or Black participants (7.4%); 37 biracial, multiracial, or multiethnic participants (5.5%); 485 Latine participants (72.0%); 77 White participants (11.4%); and 24 participants who identified as another race or ethnicity (3.6%). After randomization, there were 294 participants in the eGPC group and 380 participants in the eIPC group. No difference in reductions in depressive symptom severity from baseline to 3 months postpartum by randomization group was observed (Cohen d for between-group change, 0.1; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.3; P = .45), adjusting for baseline depressive symptom severity, self-reported history of a mental health condition, language, and calendar time at enrollment. Instead, participants in both groups experienced small to moderate reductions in depression symptoms from baseline to 3 months postpartum (eGPC: mean [SD] difference, -2.2 [5.3]; Cohen d = -0.4; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.3; P &lt; .001; eIPC: mean [SD] difference, -1.6 [4.5]; Cohen d = -0.5; 95% CI, -0.6 to -0.4; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of pregnant, low-income, primarily Latine individuals, statistically significant improvements were observed in depressive symptom severity from baseline to postpartum, regardless of prenatal care type. There was no evidence of a difference between enhanced prenatal care types for improving depressive symptoms. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04154423.</description>

SLPI plays critical roles in tissue homeostasis and pathology. Through its anti-protease ability, SLPI safeguards tissues from excessive damage caused by proteolytic enzymes released during inflammation and contributes to extracellular matrix remodeling, thereby influencing the cellular and tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, SLPI expression is implicated in shaping the immune landscape that facilitates tumor progression, and in driving epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Consequently, it is not surprising that SLPI plays a complex and context-dependent role across various malignancies. It is overexpressed in most cancers such as colorectal, gastric, pancreatic, and breast carcinomas, and this overexpression often correlates with a more advanced and aggressive disease. Conversely, its levels are reduced in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, where elevated expression may be associated with a more favorable prognosis. This diverse behavior underscores that SLPI function in cancer is tissue-specific and dependent on the functional or pathological state. In prostate cancer, SLPI expression exhibits a bimodal behavior: levels are reduced in the early stages of the disease compared to normal tissues but become significantly upregulated in more advanced and aggressive stages of disease, with significantly higher levels observed in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. Elevated SLPI levels in prostate cancer correlate with a reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival. In this review, we outline the current evidence regarding the multifaceted functions of SLPI and its expanding role in cancer, focusing primarily on the recently described molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of SLPI in prostate carcinoma.</description>

Due to their rarity, the literature consists primarily of case reports. Our systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence from the last two decades to propose a standardized, multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and surgical management of MPs. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted from 2005 to 2025. Studies reporting on surgically resected adult mediastinal paragangliomas were included. Patient demographic data, diagnostic workup, surgical approaches, and outcomes were extracted and analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Analysis of 79 patients from 75 papers revealed a median age of 50 years (female predominance of 62%). Most tumors were in the middle mediastinum (51.9%). Sternotomy was the most common surgical approach (44.3%), with cardiopulmonary bypass utilized in 27.8% of cases. Postoperative complications occurred in 28% of patients, with left vocal cord palsy (12.7%) being most frequent. The median follow-up was 12 months. All percentages refer to the number of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical removal is the standard of care for curative treatment of MPs. However, surgical treatment requires meticulous planning within a multidisciplinary team to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. The choice of surgical approach-open, minimally invasive, or with circulatory support-depends on tumor site, size, and vascular involvement. This review consolidates existing evidence of MPs' surgical management, aiming to mitigate the significant risks associated with surgery. Lifelong follow-up is essential due to the potential for recurrence.</description>

The most common genetic imbalance includes the B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) locus. METHODS: We planned a bi-centric phase Ib dose-escalation study with the chemotherapy-free combination of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax and CD20 antibody obinutuzumab for rrPCNSL patients in Germany. The intended treatment consisted of 6 cycles of fixed-dose obinutuzumab at 1000 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, and an oral daily dose of 600, 800, or 1000 mg venetoclax, depending on the planned dosing group, followed by a 12-month venetoclax maintenance period. The primary endpoint was the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax and obinutuzumab in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: This study was prematurely terminated after registration of 5/15 (33%) patients in dosing group 1 (600 mg oral daily dose of venetoclax) between May 2020 and November 2021. The mean ratio of the concentration of venetoclax in CSF over peripheral blood was 0.55% (±0.28 standard deviation (SD)) and 0.25% (±0.23 SD) for obinutuzumab. Two of five patients achieved complete remission, and each one patient achieved partial remission and stable disease as best response. The median duration of response was 6.5 months (range 0.7-47). CONCLUSIONS: Venetoclax and obinutuzumab can penetrate into the central nervous system, but the CSF concentration did not correlate with the outcome. The combination is feasible, tolerable, and may lead to durable responses in selected rrPCNSL patients.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the dermoscopic features of histologically confirmed subungual squamous cell carcinoma and to compare patterns between invasive and in situ disease. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023470387) following PRISMA and MOOSE guidance. PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched. Extracted data included study design, lesion counts, histologic subtype and specific dermoscopic signs. Random-effects meta-analysis (DerSimonian-Laird with Freeman-Tukey transformation) produced pooled prevalences with 95% confidence intervals. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q and I2. We used subgroup and meta-regression analyses to explore the influence of histologic subtype, sample size and publication year. When the data allowed, diagnostic odds ratios were calculated versus common benign mimickers. RESULTS: Twenty studies comprising 121 lesions (96 invasive, 25 in situ) were included. In invasive lesions, the most common dermoscopic findings were subungual hyperkeratosis (pooled prevalence 89%; 95% CI 78-97; I2 = 0%), onycholysis (85%; 75-93; I2 = 28%), irregular borders (72%; 50-90; I2 = 42%), and splinter hemorrhages (52%; 40-65; I2 = 36%). In situ lesions more often presented with melanonychia (89%) and showed lower rates of hyperkeratosis (50%). Meta-regression identified histologic subtype as a significant predictor of feature prevalence (p &lt; 0.01). Key comparative performance estimates included a diagnostic odds ratio of 12.6 (95% CI 8.3-19.1) for polymorphous vessels distinguishing squamous cell carcinoma from warts and 6.8 (95% CI 3.2-14.5) for hyperkeratosis versus onychomycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Dermoscopy reliably identifies features, particularly hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, irregular margins and hemorrhagic spots, that are common in invasive subungual squamous cell carcinoma; in situ disease more commonly presents with pigmentary changes. Recognition of these signs should lower the threshold for biopsy of suspicious single-digit nail lesions and may facilitate earlier diagnosis and treatment.</description>

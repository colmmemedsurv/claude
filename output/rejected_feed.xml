      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Benavides E, Krecioch JR, Allareddy T, Buchanan A, Keels MA, Mascarenhas AK, Duong ML, O'Brien KK, Ziegler KM, Lipman RD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.11.013'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.11.013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Mar-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581943/'&gt;41581943&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: As an update to the 2012 American Dental Association and US Food and Drug Administration "Dental Radiographic Examinations: Recommendations for Patient Selection and Limiting Radiation Exposure," this resource provides decision-making guidance on the use of various imaging modalities for general and pediatric dental care practitioners. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs convened an expert panel of 6 members along with an expert consultant group of 18 members to develop evidence-based guidance on dental imaging. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant systematic reviews and organizational guidelines addressing 9 clinical questions. The recommendations presented were developed by means of a non-Delphi process (ie, reaching consensus through a structured process). RESULTS: Due to limitations in the available evidence, consensus recommendations rather than formal guidelines were developed. A thorough evaluation of the patient history and clinical findings should precede radiographic examinations. Previously obtained images should be reviewed, and all imaging modalities, especially cone-beam computed tomography, should be used judiciously to minimize cumulative radiation exposure to the patient. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Clinicians should base imaging decisions on the patient's medical and dental histories, clinical examination findings, disease risk assessment, and the presence of specific clinical conditions. When used appropriately, radiographic imaging contributes to dental treatment decisions and results in optimal patient care.</description>

Here, we report a tripartite enzyme complex from oral Streptococcus species-comprising 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGS), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT), and a DUF35 protein-that catalyzes an unusual Friedel-Crafts C-acetylation on a pyrrolidine-2,4-dione scaffold, completing the biosynthesis of the antibiotic reutericyclin A. Cryo-electron microscopy of the S. macacae-derived thiolase complex (SmaATase) reveals a conserved architecture resembling the archaeal HMGS/ACAT/DUF35 complex involved in the mevalonate pathway, yet with key catalytic residues rewired to reprogram substrate specificity. Biochemical characterization, molecular modeling, and evolutionary analysis confirmed that the ancestral activity of HMG-CoA synthesis has been lost, while the complex has been repurposed to mediate Friedel-Crafts C-acylation of small molecule acceptors. These findings reveal a rare example of thiolase complex neofunctionalization, shedding light on an underexplored trajectory in enzyme evolution and offering a template for engineering C-C bond-forming catalysts in synthetic biology.</description>

To investigate how morphology influences nematode-associated microbiomes, we selected two widely distributed species: Acrobeles complexus, exhibiting elaborated oral structures, and Zeldia punctata, with simpler oral morphology. Unlike earlier studies that reported the microbiomes of A. complexus and Z. punctata independently, this study is the first to directly compare the two species. By integrating in silico re-analysis of our previously published microbiome datasets with new light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, we demonstrate how morphological adaptations, such as labial probolae and cuticle structures, shape associated bacterial communities. Our results revealed that A. complexus harbored a more diverse bacterial community than Z. punctata. Morphology showed that the complex oral structures of A. complexus facilitated selective bacterial capture, supporting greater microbial diversity compared to the simpler morphology of Z. punctata. Although statistical significance was not observed, the two species showed distinct patterns of microbial richness and diversity. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) revealed clearly separated bacterial community structures between the species. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified potential microbial biomarkers at the genus level, including Firmicutes and Clostridium in A. complexus and Actinobacteria and Pseudomonas in Z. punctata. Predicted functional pathway analysis revealed notable differences in microbial metabolism, such as enrichment of bacterial secretion systems in A. complexus and amoebiasis and lipid metabolism pathways in Z. punctata. This study highlights the role of morphological adaptations in shaping microbiome composition in Cephalobidae nematodes and provides insights into the contribution of free-living bacterivorous nematodes to soil microbial balance. These findings lay the groundwork for further studies on nematode-mediated microbial interactions in soil ecosystems.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kim D, Lee C, Ryu G, Kong DS, Lee WJ, Kim HY, Jung YG, Hong SD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70145'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70145&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41614369/'&gt;41614369&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Nasoseptal flap (NSF) with floor extension provides wide coverage for skull base reconstruction but transects the nasopalatine nerve, potentially resulting in numbness of the front teeth and palate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative numbness, recovery of sensation, and anatomical predictors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single tertiary center. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 patients who underwent endoscopic transseptal skull base surgery and categorized them as non-NSF (n = 75), NSF without floor extension (n = 7), and NSF with floor extension (n = 78). The primary outcome was patient-reported numbness of the front teeth or palate as assessed during hospitalization and at 3 months. The incisive canal, through which paired NPNs from the nasal cavities pass into the oral cavity, was classified on preoperative computed tomography (CT) as single (one channel receiving bilateral nerves), separated (two channels with bilateral separation), or intermediate (Y-shaped channel). RESULTS: Immediate numbness occurred in 5.3%, 14.3%, and 32.1% of those groups, respectively (P &lt; .001). At 3 months, persistent numbness was reported, respectively, in 1.3%, 0%, and 10.4%, with a significant difference between non-NSF and NSF with floor extension (P = .034). Immediate numbness occurred in 29.7% of those with a single canal and 11.3% of those with a separated canal (P = .021). CONCLUSION: NSF with floor extension increased the incidence of numbness and should be avoided when possible. Patients with a single canal on preoperative CT require careful surgical attention.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lee HJ, Son SY, Kim SI, Lee YC, Ko SG, Eun YG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70407'&gt;10.1002/lary.70407&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41614236/'&gt;41614236&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of objectively confirmed laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) in patients with laryngeal contact granuloma (LCG) using 24-h hypopharyngeal-esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH (HEMII-pH) monitoring, and to compare patient and disease features by reflux status. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with LCG who underwent 24-h HEMII-pH monitoring. Reflux episodes were classified by acidity (acid, weakly acidic, weakly alkaline) and posture (upright, recumbent). Clinical characteristics, reflux episode profiles, lesion laterality, and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) scores were compared between reflux-positive and reflux-negative patients. RESULTS: Among 41 patients, 25 (61.0%) were reflux-positive and 16 (39.0%) were reflux-negative, with no hypopharyngeal reflux event detected. The pH-based classification of reflux events identified a predominance of weakly acidic (46.2%) and weakly alkaline (44.3%) episodes; acidic events were uncommon (9.5%). Most reflux events occurred during upright periods (94.8%), with only 5.2% during recumbent position. Among unilateral lesions, a higher proportion of hypopharyngeal reflux-positive cases involved the left side (76.2% left, 23.8% right), while reflux-negative cases showed no lateral preference (60.0% left, 40.0% right). Symptom screening with the RSI had limited discrimination for hypopharyngeal reflux status (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 46.7%, PPV 60.0%, NPV 36.8%). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the limitations of symptom-based diagnosis and empiric acid suppression in patients with LCG. Pre-treatment 24-h HEMII-pH monitoring can provide a more evidence-based initial approach than routine empiric therapy and supports individualized behavioral interventions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lin S, Zhong J, Yuan S, Su M, Zhang Y, Zhang X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-026-15636-9'&gt;10.1186/s12885-026-15636-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41612311/'&gt;41612311&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer (CC) remains a major global health burden, with tumor microenvironment (TME) plasticity and immune evasion driving its progression. The intricate heterogeneity of neutrophils and their complex crosstalk within the TME remain poorly understood, thereby limiting the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented level of resolution for dissecting neutrophil subpopulations and elucidating their roles in CC pathogenesis. METHODS: We integrated scRNA-seq data from CC tissues (GSE208653, n = 5) with bulk RNA-seq cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas - Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Using Seurat-based clustering, pseudotime trajectory analysis and CellChat, we mapped neutrophil dynamics and intercellular communication networks. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the limma package, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. A prognostic model was subsequently constructed via LASSO-Cox regression. Key targets were further validated through both in vitro functional assays, immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses of human pathological specimens. RESULTS: Four functionally distinct neutrophil subtypes, including immature, mature, antitumor, and interferon-stimulated populations, were characterized in CC, demonstrating dynamic heterogeneity during tumorigenesis. Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) was identified as a critical differentially expressed gene, with the SPP1-CD44 axis serving as a key mediator of neutrophil-tumor cell crosstalk. Downregulation of SPP1 markedly suppressed CC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Furthermore, a prognostic signature based on risk stratification efficiently categorized patients into high- and low-risk cohorts, with validated clinical utility in predicting survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study comprehensively characterized the TME in CC through single-cell transcriptomics. Integrated analysis with bulk RNA-seq established and validated a robust prognostic signature, identifying SPP1 as a key oncogenic driver. The SPP1-centric model demonstrates significant clinical utility for risk stratification. These findings provide new insights into neutrophil heterogeneity and establish a mechanistic foundation for precision therapeutics in CC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 25-item questionnaire with three dimensions was developed. Using convenience sampling, 136 OLP patients from a tertiary hospital in Guangdong Province (December 2023-April 2024) completed the survey. Among them, 30 patients were retested 2-4 weeks after the initial survey, during which no participants received any OLP-related health education interventions. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's α coefficient, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability, while validity was assessed via the content validity index, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire showed strong reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.923; test-retest reliability = 0.909) and validity (content validity index = 0.93). Factor analysis identified three dimensions, explaining 60.84% of the total variance, with adequate model fit indices. CONCLUSIONS: This validated 25-item questionnaire (covering knowledge, attitude, and practice dimensions) serves as an initial, reliable measure of OLP-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-management practices with acceptable construct validity in a single-center sample.</description>

METHODS: Quantitative synthesis without meta-analysis was conducted through an electronic search conducted on Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from 1946 to April 2024 with no restriction on study design. Primary outcome was postoperative bleeding in patients with platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL due to dental interventions. Two reviewers assessed independently, and a third resolved conflicts. This study was reported according to PRISMA 2020 and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024527279). RESULTS: 1633 unique articles were identified. Six case reports, four case series, nine cohort studies and one trial fulfilled the inclusion. Overall, 983 included cases consisted of 968 oral surgery, 10 periodontology and 5 dental anaesthesia cases. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 65 cases following oral surgery procedures, of which 1 was life-threatening. Bleeding rates for cases with platelet levels &lt; 50,000/μL were 12.9%, and 4.9% for ≥ 50,000/μL. Risk ratio was 2.95 (95% CI: 1.76-4.96; p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that platelet counts &lt; 50,000/μL is a contraindication for dental interventions, although findings suggest higher postoperative bleeding rates, particularly in oral surgery. Patients should be assessed individually, with more controlled trials required.</description>

Disruptions in NCC development can result in congenital disorders (neurocristopathies). Yet, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms and signals that govern mammalian NCC formation remains poor. Here, we discovered nuclear receptor superfamily 6 group member 1 (NR6A1/GCNF/RTR) is a novel, critical regulator of mammalian NCC specification, formation and survival. Nr6a1 expression in mouse embryos spatiotemporally overlaps with early NCC development. NR6A1 loss-of-function perturbs anterior cranial NCC formation and survival, with complete agenesis of migratory NCC caudal to the first pharyngeal arch. Using targeted molecular and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that these phenotypes are associated with perturbation of NCC specification and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and with persistent expression of pluripotency-associated factors. Supporting these observations, in vivo overexpression of Oct4 in gastrulating mouse embryos disrupts NCC specification and formation. Conditional temporal deletion revealed that Nr6a1 is required during mid-late gastrulation, demonstrating that the initiation of murine NCC specification likely occurs during gastrulation - earlier than previously thought, but in close alignment with the established timeline of NCC development in other vertebrate model organisms. These findings also reveal that the gold standard transgenic mouse line, Wnt1-Cre, is unsuitable for studying genetic function during NCC specification and formation. In summary, NR6A1 is essential for mammalian NCC development and may function during gastrulation as a bimodal switch modulating pluripotency-associated factors in the neuroepithelium, while concomitantly activating NCC specifiers and regulators of EMT.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 205 hospitalized children diagnosed with MPP at the Third Ward of the department of paediatrics, Jingzhou Central Hospital, from October 2023 to October 2024. Diagnosis was confirmed by pharyngeal MP nucleic acid testing and MP antibody titers (MP-Ab ≥ 1:160). All patients were screened for macrolide-resistant gene mutations (A2063G/A2064G). Patients were categorized based on the presence of macrolide-resistant gene mutations and RMPP diagnosis. Clinical features, laboratory results, and treatments were compared between groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for RMPP. RESULTS: Among 205 children with MPP, 157 (76.6%) harbored A2063G/A2064G mutations. Of the 77 children with RMPP, 71 (92.2%) carried these mutations, showing a significant association (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to the non-resistant group, children with resistant mutations had prolonged fever duration, delayed defervescence after azithromycin, and required more bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (P &lt; 0.05). The RMPP group exhibited more severe symptoms, longer fever and hospital stays, higher inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, D-dimer, ESR, PCT; P &lt; 0.001), and more frequent pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, plastic bronchitis, and extrapulmonary involvement. Multivariate analysis identified macrolide-resistant mutations, fever duration, and D-dimer level as independent risk factors for RMPP. CONCLUSION: The widespread macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae (76.6% in this cohort) was associated with point mutations at the A2063G and/or A2064G loci in the 23S rRNA gene. The development of RMPP is linked to macrolide-resistant mutations, duration of fever and D-dimer levels. D-dimer emerged as the most predictive risk factor.</description>

Volume overload represents a critical factor in effectively controlling hypertension. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) has been validated as an accurate method for assessing volume status. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of BIA-derived volume indicators for hypertension and circadian BP rhythm abnormalities in MHD patients, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing volume control and BP management. METHODS: We used body composition monitor to assess pre-dialysis volume status and employed 44-hour interdialytic ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to obtain BP parameters. Comparative analyses were conducted between controlled vs. uncontrolled ABPM groups, and normal vs. abnormal circadian BP rhythm groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify correlations and independent predictors, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determining optimal predictive cut-off values. RESULTS: Patients in the uncontrolled ABPM group exhibited higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), post-dialysis serum creatinine (Post-HD Scr), post-dialysis urea nitrogen (Post-HD BUN), overhydration (OH), extracellular water (ECW), body surface area-adjusted ECW (ECW/BSA), ECW to total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) and ECW to intracellular water ratio (ECW/ICW), but lower Kt/V and URR. The abnormal circadian BP rhythm group showed higher iPTH, OH, ECW, ECW/BSA and ECW/ICW. Significant correlations were observed: 44h SBP correlated positively with iPTH, OH, ECW/TBW, ECW/ICW, and negatively with Kt/V, URR; 44h DBP correlated positively with iPTH and OH; nocturnal systolic BP decline rate (NSDP) showed negative correlations with iPTH, OH. Multivariate logistic analysis identified OH &gt; 2.35L, ECW/ICW &gt; 0.945 and iPTH &gt; 240.6 pg/ml as independent predictors for hypertension, while OH &gt; 1.55L and iPTH &gt; 203.75 pg/mL predicted abnormal circadian BP rhythm (all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: BIA-derived indicators of volume overload, particularly OH and ECW/ICW, can guide ABPM management in MHD patients and improve long-term outcomes.</description>

The impact of soft diets, which reduce masticatory load, on myokine signaling remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined whether reduced mastication alters myokine secretion from the masseter muscle and affects muscle development and systemic metabolic regulation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either hard or soft diets for short-term (1 week) or long-term (7 weeks). Body weight, masseter muscle weight, epididymal fat weight, and fiber cross-sectional area were assessed. The expression of key myokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, Nfkb1, and myostatin [Mstn]) was measured using qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction), and myostatin protein levels were evaluated using immunohistochemical assays. Short-term soft diet feeding did not produce any major morphological changes. However, long-term feeding significantly reduced masseter weight and fiber size, while increasing the amount of epididymal fat, despite an unchanged total body weight. At the molecular level, IL-6 expression was consistently lower in soft diet-fed mice, and IL-10 levels declined further with long-term feeding. In contrast, TNF-α, Nfkb1, and Mstn levels were elevated at both ages. The immunohistochemical assays confirmed increased myostatin protein levels in the masseter under soft-diet conditions. These results suggest that reduced masticatory stimulation remodels the biochemical environment of the masseter muscle, suppressing anabolic and anti-inflammatory signals while enhancing catabolic pathways. These alterations impair muscle growth and promote fat accumulation indicating that masticatory load regulates craniofacial muscle development and systemic metabolism through myokine-mediated mechanisms. Therefore, maintaining adequate mastication during growth may be critical for oral health, body composition, and long-term metabolic homeostasis.</description>

Though case reports document frontal sinus complications years after surgery, no studies to date examine the presence of delayed frontal sinus disease on long-term imaging after FFC. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: Adult patients who underwent FFC with type III forehead classification between August 2016 to December 2019 were offered postoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. Preoperative and postoperative CTs were compared using the Lund-Mackay (LM) scoring system and assessed for frontal sinus disease. Retrospective chart review for demographic data and new diagnoses of sinusitis were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 40 transfeminine patients were included. The average time from surgery to postoperative CT scan was 71 months (median: 67.5 months; range: 56-96 months). The mean preoperative and postoperative total LM scores were 0.98 and 1.05 (P = .83), respectively. The mean frontal sinus-specific preoperative and postoperative LM scores were 0.2 and 0.15 (P = .64), respectively. Though 5 (12.5%) patients exhibited trace frontal sinus mucosal thickening on postoperative CT scans, significant frontal sinus pathology (eg, mucoceles, osteomyelitis, sinocutaneous fistula) was not found in any patient, and none required surgical treatment for sinus-related disease. CONCLUSION: FFC is a relatively safe procedure with low risk for frontal sinus-related complications within the first 6 years after surgery. Continued surveillance should be considered to detect serious frontal sinus pathology that may develop beyond this timeframe.</description>

Effective treatment is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled trial involving adults with acute, nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion who had symptom onset within 4.5 hours before treatment. Patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive intravenous tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight) and oral placebo or intravenous placebo and oral aspirin (at a dose of 300 mg). The primary end point was vision recovery, defined as a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the affected eye at 30 days of up to 0.7 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; equivalent to ≥20/100). Key secondary visual end points were a BCVA of up to 0.5 logMAR (equivalent to ≥20/63), mean improvement in BCVA, and perimetry score at 30 days. Key safety end points included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and death. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients at 16 sites in six countries underwent randomization, with 40 assigned to receive tenecteplase and 38 to receive aspirin. At 30 days, 8 patients (20%) in the tenecteplase group and 9 patients (24%) in the aspirin group had vision recovery (risk difference, -3.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -22.0 to 14.7; P = 0.69). The outcomes with regard to the secondary visual end points did not differ substantially between the groups. There was a greater incidence of adverse events in the tenecteplase group, including one fatal intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous tenecteplase administered within 4.5 hours after onset of central retinal artery occlusion did not result in significantly greater vision recovery at 30 days than oral aspirin but was associated with serious safety concerns.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TACTIC CRC-02 was a single-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients had previously untreated, unresectable MSS/pMMR, RAS-mutant mCRC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received intravenous tislelizumab (200 mg/m2), bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) on day 1, with oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily) on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle, for up to eight induction cycles followed by maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS: Between March 2023 and March 2024, 52 patients were enrolled and treated. At a median follow-up of 17.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.8 months-not reached), the primary endpoint was met with an ORR of 73.1% (95% CI 61.1% to 85.1%). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95% CI 9.1-11.6 months), and the median overall survival was not mature. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21.2% of patients, with grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events occurring in 1.9%. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with tislelizumab plus XELOX and bevacizumab demonstrated a high ORR and a manageable safety profile in patients with MSS/pMMR, RAS-mutant mCRC. This chemo-immunotherapy combination represents a promising strategy and warrants further investigation in a phase III trial.</description>

In 2022, HPV16/18 genotyping was added for women with borderline/low-grade cytology. Triage with HPV genotyping may better balance screening benefits, harms, and costs. Therefore, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 19 triage strategies based on net monetary benefit (NMB) at cost-effectiveness thresholds of €20,000 and €50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with the highest NMB indicating the most cost-effective strategy. Triage tests included 16/18 genotyping, 7-type (16/18/31/33/45/52/58) genotyping, and cytology (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSIL]: moderate/severe, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US]/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSIL]: borderline/low-grade, negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy [NILM]: normal). Effects on cancer incidence and mortality were obtained by combining POBASCAM trial data with nationwide screening and cancer registries. Time since the onset of high-grade lesion (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [grade 2/3] [CIN2/3]) at baseline of the Population-based Screening Study Amsterdam trial cannot be estimated from the data and was varied between 0 and 10 years. At a €20,000/QALY threshold, immediate referral for HSIL and 16/18-positive ASC-US/LSIL, and repeat cytology for 16/18-negative ASC-US/LSIL and 7-types positive NILM had the highest NMB (€214.1 to €309.3/woman gained compared to referring all HPV-positive women). At a €50,000/QALY threshold, immediate referral for all 16/18-positives and/or HSIL, and repeat cytology for 16/18-negative ASC-US/LSIL and 7-types positive NILM had the highest NMB if time since onset of CIN2/3 was greater than 2 years. Cytology combined with HPV16/18 and extended genotyping is cost-effective for triage of HPV-positives. Immediate colposcopy referral of all HPV16/18-positives is cost-effective at a €50,000/QALY threshold.</description>

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may overcome resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The clinical activity and safety of FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC or anti-PD-1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy in melanoma have not been evaluated. Here we report results from FMT-LUMINate, a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial assessing healthy donor FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC (n = 20) or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (dual ICI) in melanoma (n = 20), in the first-line setting. Eligible patients received a single FMT via oral capsules prior to ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in NSCLC. Secondary endpoints included ORR in melanoma, safety and donor-host microbiome similarity. In NSCLC, the ORR was 80% (16/20), meeting the study primary endpoint. In melanoma, the ORR was 75% (15/20). FMT was deemed safe in both cohorts by an independent data and safety monitoring committee, with no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) in NSCLC and 13 (65%) patients experiencing grade 3 or higher AEs in melanoma. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed that responders developed a distinct post-FMT gut microbiome composition, independent of acquired donor-recipient similarity or strain-level engraftment. Responders exhibited significantly greater loss of baseline bacterial species compared to non-responders, with frequent depletion of Enterocloster citroniae, E. lavalensis and Clostridium innocuum. This finding was reproduced across three published FMT oncology trials. We recolonized antibiotic-treated, tumor-bearing mice with post-FMT stool from two responder patients, and reintroduction of the specific bacterial species that were lost after FMT abrogated the antitumor effect of ICI. Taken together, these findings confirm the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI and suggest that the elimination of deleterious taxa is required for FMT-mediated therapeutic benefit.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wu ZH, Chu ZX, Meng YL, Jiang YJ, Shang H, Hu QH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68970-8'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-68970-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41605946/'&gt;41605946&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite proven oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) efficacy, adherence barriers among men who have sex with men (MSM) persist. Economic viability of digital adherence tools in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires validation. We assessed the 6-month within-trial cost-effectiveness of a digital intervention for real-time enhancement of oral PrEP adherence (DIRECT-PrEP) in China, from health system, multipayer, and societal perspectives. Costs were derived from hospital records, and effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and PrEP-adherence days (PADs). Among 442 participants (247 intervention, 195 standard care), incremental costs per QALY gained for the smart pillbox intervention were $19,575.93 (health system), $19,656.66 (multipayer), and $19,844.42 (societal)-all below the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product ($31,200). Costs per PAD gained were $30.46-$30.86, achieving &gt;95% probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $47.50-$48.50 per PAD. Notably, the intervention demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness per QALY among participants stratified as more socially vulnerable ($16,259.77-$16,490.41) compared with those classified as less socially vulnerable ($23,514.83-$23,834.38). These results establish the smart-pillbox digital intervention as a cost-effective strategy for oral PrEP adherence within primary healthcare settings in LMICs, particularly when prioritizing more socially vulnerable populations, though long-term scalability requires further validation.</description>

We hypothesized that ultra-low-dose nivolumab would retain clinical efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase III randomized superiority trial, patients with advanced solid tumors (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) and progression on ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to ultra-low-dose nivolumab (20 mg intravenously once every 2 weeks) or standard chemotherapy (docetaxel or paclitaxel, as per tumor type). Treatment continued until progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2024, we enrolled 500 patients: 250 per arm; 52% had head and neck and 36% lung cancers. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 1 (range, 1-8); 29% had received ≥2 prior lines. Median OS was significantly longer with ultra-low-dose nivolumab: 5.88 months (95% CI, 4.99 to 7.13) versus 4.70 months (95% CI, 3.91 to 5.65; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.97]; P = .022). One-year OS was 27.3% versus 16.9%. Median progression-free survival was similar: 2.04 months (95% CI, 2.00 to 2.10) with ultra-low-dose nivolumab and 2.09 months (95% CI, 2.04 to 2.17) with chemotherapy (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.23]; P = .77). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were less frequent with ultra-low-dose nivolumab (42.5% v 60.8%; P &lt; .001). Quality of life (QoL) was significantly better with ultra-low-dose nivolumab. CONCLUSION: Ultra-low-dose nivolumab significantly improves OS versus chemotherapy in pretreated solid tumors, with fewer severe toxicities and better QoL. These findings support re-evaluation of ICI dosing strategies and may enhance global access.</description>

While the causes of cancer are complex and varied, certain risk factors - such as exposure to environmental pollutants and specific lifestyle choices - are modifiable and can be addressed. A case-control study was conducted in Bangladesh from 25 August 2023 to 18 April 2024 to examine the association between cancer risk and a range of lifestyle and environmental factors. The study specifically focused on six common cancer types: breast, hematological, oral, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer. This study identified several lifestyle and environmental factors positively associated with cancer risk. Individuals using wood or kerosene for cooking had higher odds of cancer compared to those using supplied gas (AOR = 3.886). Consumption of overcooked or poorly cooked food was associated with an increased risk of cancer compared to the consumption of well-cooked food (AOR = 2.478). Oral hygiene also showed a relationship, with participants brushing their teeth only 2-3 times a week having a higher chance of cancer compared to those who brush regularly (AOR = 3.103). In addition, frequent exposure to mosquito repellent was positively associated with cancer risk (AOR = 1.569), and exposure to inorganic dust showed a similar association (AOR = 1.673). These findings highlight modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors that could inform future cancer prevention strategies in Bangladesh.</description>

This exploratory study assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel once-daily oral selective TRPC6 inhibitor, BI 764198. METHODS: This multicentre phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial assessed BI 764198 (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg once daily) versus placebo over 12 weeks in participants aged 18-75 years with biopsy-confirmed primary FSGS (based on the absence of clinical evidence of secondary cause) or with a disease-causing TRPC6 variant. The study took place in 31 sites in ten countries, and random allocation was performed centrally in blocks in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and was stratified according to use of corticosteroids. Participants were receiving stable conservative and immunosuppressive therapy, with screening urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) at 1·0 g/g or greater and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 30 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or greater. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with proteinuria response (≥25% UPCR reduction from baseline) at week 12. Other key outcomes were safety and tolerability. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on Jan 27, 2022 (NCT05213624) and is complete as of Jan 3, 2025. FINDINGS: From March 10, 2022, to Sept 3, 2024, 139 participants were screened and 67 were randomly assigned to receive placebo or BI 764198 at doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg (five participants were randomly assigned in error and were not treated). 62 participants received treatment, two of whom had missing baseline or post-baseline UPCR measurements and were not included in the full analysis set. Overall, 37 participants (60%) were male and 25 participants (40%) were female; the mean age was 40·7 years (SD 12·6); and the majority of the trial cohort were White (39 [63%] of 62). Proteinuria responses were observed in eight (44%) of 18, two (14%) of 14, and six (43%) of 14 participants receiving BI 764198 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively (16 [35%] of 46 for all BI 764198 doses) versus one (7%) of 14 receiving placebo; corresponding odds ratios (ORs) versus placebo were OR 10·0 (95% CI 1·6-118·1), 1·5 (0·2-19·5), and 6·0 (0·9-73·6) for the three doses of BI 764198, and 4·9 (1·0-48·8) for all doses combined. BI 764198 was well tolerated with no meaningful differences in adverse event frequencies across treatment arms; treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 44 (71%) of 62 participants, with similar frequencies of adverse events observed in the placebo group (ten [71%] of 14) and BI 764198 groups (34 [71%] of 48). INTERPRETATION: BI 764198 lowered proteinuria and was well tolerated by participants in this trial. This is the first evidence of efficacy with a podocyte-targeted therapy in FSGS. Larger randomised controlled trials over longer treatment durations, enabling meaningful subgroup analyses, are planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BI 764198 treatment in FSGS and other conditions affected by podocytopathy.

Here, we report the clinical efficacy and safety profile of lazertinib plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in treatment-naive, EGFR-mutant oligometastatic NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ABLATE is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, non-comparative study that included patients harboring activating EGFR mutations (ex19del or L858R) with synchronous oligometastatic disease (metastatic lesion ≤5). Patients received oral lazertinib 240 mg as monotherapy or in combination with SBRT, which was given immediately or 8 weeks after initiation of lazertinib. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS of lazertinib plus SBRT. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were enrolled in the study (n = 34, lazertinib; n = 33, lazertinib plus SBRT). At a median follow-up duration of 23.1 months (range 7.1-34.1 months), the median PFS was 34.0 months [90% confidence interval (CI) 19.2 months-not reached (NR)] and objective response rate (ORR) was 58% (95% CI 40.7% to 74.4%) for the lazertinib plus SBRT group. In lazertinib monotherapy, the median duration of follow-up was 22.4 months (range 3.7-33.5 months), the median PFS was 24.8 months (90% CI 15.7 months-NR), and ORR was 68% (95% CI 51.9% to 83.4%). SBRT led to local treatment effect with 92% (n = 12/14) progressing to new sites at progression. No new safety signals were seen with the addition of SBRT, and no grade ≥3 radiation pneumonitis was seen. Whole-exome sequencing of baseline tumor samples revealed that TP53 (64%), CRLF2 (43%), and P2RY9 (43%) were the most common mutations in patients treated with lazertinib plus SBRT. CONCLUSION: In treatment-naive, EGFR-mutant oligometastatic NSCLC, adding upfront SBRT to lazertinib is a viable therapeutic option with a manageable safety profile.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This first-in-human, phase I trial evaluated patients with BRAF V600-mutated advanced solid tumors, including brain metastases (≤3 cm) and primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Patients received ABM-1310 monotherapy [25-250 mg twice a day (b.i.d.); Parts A/C] or in combination (ABM-1310 : 100-200 mg b.i.d.; cobimetinib 60 mg once a day, days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; Part B). Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1 or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled (36 monotherapy, 17 combination). Median age was 55 years; 68% were male, 72% had ≥3 prior treatment lines, 92.5% had BRAF V600E mutations, 75% of patients had received prior BRAF plus MEK inhibitor therapy, and 7.5% had BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Common tumor types included melanoma (47%), glioblastoma (17%) and thyroid cancer (13%). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were QT prolongation and rash. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in 6/37 patients (16.2%), all at doses ≥150 mg. All DLTs involved asymptomatic electrocardiogram QT prolonged, with two cases presenting co-occurring toxicities: one with rash and one with renal failure-establishing the MTD at 200 mg b.i.d. Among 50 efficacy-evaluable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 12% and disease control rate (DCR) was 64%. Median progression-free survival was 4.96 months (2.07-8.31) and median overall survival was 24.48 months 11.6-not estimable. In patients with primary CNS tumors (n = 13), ORR was 23.1% and DCR 76.9%. PK analyses showed dose-proportional exposure and moderate accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: ABM-1310 showed a favorable safety profile and encouraging intracranial activity. These findings support continued evaluation for CNS tumors and in cancer patients with prior BRAF inhibitor exposure.</description>

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endocycle throughout the fly's life, increasing their ploidy and size, while at the same time cells in this tissue are lost into the gut lumen as the fly ages. Functionally, these cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when their endocycling is experimentally increased or decreased, there is a concomitant change in ploidy, tissue size, and peritrophic membrane synthesis. Further, we show that inhibition of endocycling makes flies more susceptible to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function in the face of cell loss due to aging or tissue damage.</description>

Implant placement techniques-freehand, pilot-drilled, and fully guided-differ in accuracy, surgical time, and outcomes. In this study, only one predefined index implant per patient was analyzed to avoid confounding from multi-implant cases, and template fabrication for the pilot-drilled group was performed using diagnostic wax-up and thermoplastic material. This study evaluated these techniques in partially edentulous patients. METHODS: Ninety patients were randomly assigned to three groups: freehand (n = 30), pilot- drilled (n = 30), and fully guided (n = 30). Surgery duration, implant placement accuracy, post- operative complications, early implant failure rates, and patient satisfaction were measured. Accuracy was assessed using standardized CBCT imaging at 12 months, and satisfaction was evaluated via a validated questionnaire six months after prosthetic loading. RESULTS: The fully guided technique demonstrated superior accuracy (p &lt; 0.001), shorter surgical times (45 minutes vs. 60 and 75 minutes, p &lt; 0.01), fewer complications (5% vs. 15% and 20%, p &lt; 0.05), and higher satisfaction (9.2/10, p &lt; 0.01). Early implant failure, defined at the implant level, occurred in 4/30 implants (13.3%) in the freehand group, 0/30 in the pilot-drilled group, and 2/30 in the fully guided group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fully guided implant surgery outperformed other techniques in accuracy, efficiency, and patient satisfaction. These findings support fully guided, prosthetically driven workflows as a preferred option for partially edentulous patients, particularly in cases requiring high precision.</description>

Our study aimed to identify additional factors associated with hypoglycaemia in children with acute vomiting and dehydration. METHODS: Our retrospective single-centre study included 560 healthy children and adolescents (aged 29 days to 17.96 years) without known metabolic disorders admitted to hospital with dehydration due to acute illness with vomiting or poor oral intake. Historical and anthropometric parameters were evaluated as potential factors associated with hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: A total of 171 (30.5%) participants (aged 0.6-10.7, median 3.8 years) experienced hypoglycaemia (≤3.3 mmol/l). Besides known factors such as a higher degree of dehydration (OR 2.505, 95% CI 1.532-4.095) and complete absence of oral intake (OR 2.185, 95% CI 1.331-3.586), additional factors independently associated with hypoglycaemia included diarrhoea (OR 0.178, 95% CI 0.068-0.468) and lower body mass index (BMI) (OR 0.011, 95% CI 0.000-0.605). Children with hypoglycaemia had a significantly lower BMI (median 14.29 vs 15.46 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001) than children without hypoglycaemia. Only one child with hypoglycaemia was obese. The highest rate of hypoglycaemia (37.5-51.6%) was observed in the 2-7-year age groups, who also had the lowest median BMI values (13.9-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: Low BMI and absence of diarrhoea were associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia. The typical BMI curve for children with physiologically low values at 2-7 years of age may partially explain the high incidence of hypoglycaemia in otherwise healthy children with decreased oral intake at this age.</description>

While the heritability to NMTC is among the highest of all cancers, the genetic determinants among NMTC families are not well understood. Here, we aim to understand the contribution of rare noncoding germline variants in the etiology of FNMTC. METHODS: We previously reported whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and linkage analysis in 17 PTC families and reported on 41 protein-coding variants in 40 genes that cosegregated with PTC in 11 of the families. Herein, we further leveraged our WGS data to include noncoding variants in our analysis for all 17 families. We hypothesized that most of the pathogenic noncoding variants would be located in theoretical or empirically determined regulatory regions that demonstrate at a minimum, basal thyroid expression, a positive family linkage score, and co-segregation among PTC-affected individuals. To test this hypothesis, we adopted a unique filtering strategy to identify variants that occurred in known DNA elements and transcription factor binding sites, near regions known to impact on gene expression or splicing in thyroid tissue, and/or in characterized thyroid enhancers. We annotated variants using two analyses (ENCODE and transcription factor binding site) within the BasePlayer software. We separately analyzed (1) expression quantitative trait loci, (2) splicing quantitative trait loci, and (3) thyroid enhancers. We then ranked variants according to predicted pathogenicity and performed Sanger sequencing in all individuals of each family. RESULTS: In total, 121 variants were selected based on in-silico prediction and our custom ranking analysis in each pedigree. Of these, 56 variants showed cosegregation among all PTC-affected individuals and were absent from unaffected individuals. This included candidate variants from five of the six PTC families for whom no protein-coding variants were previously found. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that noncoding variants are important in the etiology of FNMTC and provide a framework for identifying noncoding germline variants using a novel approach. Further studies are needed to functionally characterize these variants to better understand the molecular mechanism of their pathogenicity.</description>

The papain-like protease (PLpro) is a dual-functional enzyme essential for viral replication and suppression of host innate immunity. Here, we present the rational design and characterization of YL1004, a tricyclic oral PLpro inhibitor demonstrating robust, cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity and favorable pharmacokinetic properties. YL1004 potently inhibits the enzymatic function of PLpro, disrupts deubiquitination and deISGylation processes, and restores antiviral immune signaling cascades. Notably, YL1004 suppresses the replication of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype, Delta and Omicron variants. Additionally, it is also effective against the Mpro E166V recombinant SARS-CoV-2 strain, which confers resistance to nirmatrelvir. In the lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection model using K18-hACE2 mice, YL1004 confers complete protection to animal survival, significantly reduces viral load in nasal turbinate and lung tissues, and alleviates virus-induced pathological tissue damages. Co-crystal structural analysis revealed a distinctive binding mode, enhancing target engagement through expanded hydrophobic interactive interface and additional hydrogen bonding interactions. Collectively, these findings establish YL1004 as a promising therapeutic candidate, harnessing dual antiviral and immunomodulatory mechanisms to combat SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.</description>

However, we show that different linked and charged polysaccharides can penetrate Caco-2 cell monolayers, and find β-1,3-linked glucan and α-1,4-linked glucan is detectable in rats (male) and mice plasma and liver after oral administration the isotope (99mTc, 3H) and fluorescein labeled polysaccharides. Using gene-knockdown strategies and inhibitors, we further show polysaccharide uptake requires clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and its associated factors Rab5 and dynamin1 in intestinal cells. Strikingly, polysaccharide absorption is attenuated in both CLTC intestine deficient mice and RAB5A, DNM1conventional-knockout mice. Importantly, membrane receptors bone morphogenetic protein receptor type IA (BMPRIA), Dectin-1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are also critical for specific structural polysaccharide internalization. These findings provide novel insight to understand polysaccharide absorption mechanism and lay foundation for oral polysaccharide-based new drugs development.</description>

Many disorders have manifestations within the larynx and patients may present initially to the otolaryngologist with breathing, voice, or swallow concerns. This review focuses on the laryngotracheal manifestations of various autoimmune diseases and associated laryngoscopic abnormalities that commonly occur with autoimmune disease, including infraglottic stenosis, bamboo nodules, cricoarytenoid joint ankylosis, supraglottic stenosis, and multilevel airway stenosis. Commonly implicated autoimmune disorders including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), ANCA-negative GPA, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pemphigus vulgaris, ankylosing spondylitis, sarcoidosis, relapsing polychondritis, and IgG4-related disease are reviewed with emphasis on clinical presentation, typical laryngoscopic findings, diagnostic criteria, and therapeutic options specific to the larynx. A systematic multi-disciplinary approach between the otolaryngologist and rheumatologist is presented. Prompt identification of a laryngeal abnormality as being potentially related to autoimmune disease and direct communication with rheumatology colleagues can offer patients medical treatment options in addition to procedural intervention and may offer long-term benefits to laryngeal function and overall disease-specific health.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: TriNetX Analytics Network, a federated database of de-identified health records from multiple healthcare institutions. METHODS: Infants who underwent primary CLR before 1 year of age were identified using ICD-10 and CPT codes. Patients were categorized into early cleft lip repair (ECLR, &lt;3 months) and traditional cleft lip repair (TLR, 3-12 months) groups. Propensity score matching was performed. Rates of HTS and revision surgery were compared between groups using chi-squared tests and regression analyses. RESULTS: Among 6786 patients, 4321 underwent ECLR and 2465 underwent TLR. HTS was significantly less common in the ECLR group (3.2%) than in the TLR group (5.2%, P = .002). Increasing age at repair was positively correlated with HTS incidence (r2 = 0.58, P = .048). However, revision surgery was more frequent following ECLR (6.6%) compared to TLR (2.6%, P &lt; .001) with age inversely correlated to revision rate (r2 = 0.52, P = .104). These differences persisted after propensity score matching for demographic and clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Earlier CLR (&lt;3 months) is associated with a lower rate of hypertrophic scarring but a higher rate of revision surgery. These findings underscore a trade-off in timing decisions and may guide shared decision-making for surgical planning in patients with cleft lip.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital, January 2017 to June 2023. METHODS: Hospitalized children were classified by whether they received systemic corticosteroids, in addition to systemic antibiotics, prior to any surgery. Primary outcomes were length of admission, need for orbital/sinus surgery, readmission, vision loss, and fungal infection. Multivariable regression controlled for potential confounders, including severity of disease on initial imaging study. RESULTS: Of 222 children with orbital cellulitis (mean age 8.6 years), 26 (12%) received steroids: 17 (65%) intravenous methylprednisolone or dexamethasone, 9 (35%) oral steroids; 16 (62%) 1 day and 10 (38%) 2 to 4 days of steroids. Children receiving steroids more often had proptosis (58% vs 37%, P = .045) and orbital abscess on CT (81% vs 69%, P = .004). Steroid use was associated with decreased orbital or sinus surgery (19% vs 37%; OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.1-0.9; P = .03). There were no differences in length of stay (P = .2), readmission (P = .4), or vision loss (no cases) between the study groups or fungal or secondary infection (no cases). CONCLUSION: Systemic steroid use in children with orbital cellulitis was not associated with adverse outcomes, such as vision loss or readmission, and may offer potential benefits, including avoidance of surgery in some cases. A majority received only 1 day of steroids in our study; further research might evaluate the effects of longer courses and the subjective experience of children who have periocular swelling and pain.</description>

Some of these changes are thought to be mediated through superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to measure the effects of aging on SLN motor and sensory function in a rat model. STUDY DESIGN: Animal study. SETTING: Tertiary-care center. METHODS: Evoked response studies were performed by SLN stimulation. Outcome measures included compound motor (CMAP) and sensory nerve action potential (SNAP) measurements recorded from the cricothyroid muscle and the internal branch of the SLN, respectively. Swallow force measurements were recorded by stimulating the SLN and quantifying the hyoid elevation force. Additionally, force and frequency of electrically and tactile-stimulated swallow reflex were analyzed. These measures were collected in adult Sprague-Dawley rats aged 4, 18, and 24 months. RESULTS: Compared to non-aged rats, advanced age was associated with significantly longer SNAP latency and total duration with a mean difference (95% CI) of 1.23 milliseconds (1.06-1.40) and 2.24 milliseconds (1.89-2.59), respectively. CMAP latency and total duration were also increased by 0.27 milliseconds (0.23-0.31) and 1.5 milliseconds (1.14-1.87), respectively. Advanced age was associated with decreased electrical and tactile-stimulated swallow frequency with a mean difference of 3.3 swallows/10 seconds (95% CI 1.1-5.5) and 2.1 swallows/10 seconds (95% CI 0.71-3.5), respectively. CONCLUSION: Advanced age was associated with longer SNAP and CMAP duration and decreased swallow frequency. The results suggest delayed nerve conduction as a potential mechanism for age-related swallow dysfunction in our rat model. Our work has implications in humans with the hopes for developing targeted therapies for age-related swallow dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sheeja A, Menon JR, Issac ME, Aravindakshan R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/00034894251407783'&gt;10.1177/00034894251407783&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581007/'&gt;41581007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Unilateral vocal fold paralysis (UVFP) causes denervation of intrinsic laryngeal muscles in varying degrees and results in different types of glottal configurations. While the primary goal of surgery is to improve vocal function, outcomes are strongly influenced by how effectively the underlying laryngeal physiology and alignment are restored. Denervation of the posterior cricoarytenoid (PCA) muscle causes the arytenoid to fall anteriorly and medially. Static procedures such as medialization thyroplasty does not address this. This study evaluates the impact of non-selective laryngeal reinnervation (LR) on arytenoid position and vocal function. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on 41 patients with UVFP who underwent Non selective reinnervation between 2021 and 2024 at a tertiary care hospital. Arytenoid prolapse was graded using a 3-point scale from laryngoscopy videos pre- and 6 months post-operatively. Voice outcomes were assessed using Maximum Phonation Duration (MPD) and Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10). RESULTS: Improvement in arytenoid position was defined as an upgrade by at least one grade in the prolapse grading system.70.7% of the patients showed improvement in arytenoid position 6 months post non selective reinnervation surgery. Significant postoperative improvements were observed in both MPD and VHI-10 scores (P &lt; 0.01), correlating with arytenoid stabilization and improved phonatory function. CONCLUSION: Non-selective reinnervation not only improves vocal quality but also restores arytenoid position, addressing a key component of glottic insufficiency in UVFP. These findings support reinnervation as a physiologic, durable solution with functional and anatomic advantages over static medialization.</description>

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-central to stress adaptation, immune regulation, and tissue repair-undergoes pronounced age-related alterations, including elevated basal cortisol, reduced dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate form DHEAS, and an increased cortisol:DHEA(S) ratio. These changes may impair immune function, delay recovery, and exacerbate vulnerability to treatment toxicity. This narrative review synthesizes mechanistic and clinical evidence linking HPA-axis dysregulation to treatment tolerance in geriatric oncology. Common patterns include blunted diurnal cortisol slopes, elevated evening cortisol, and low DHEA(S), which are associated with fatigue, functional decline, and reduced survival across cancer types. However, their predictive value for acute treatment toxicities remains underexplored due to methodological heterogeneity, lack of age-specific reference ranges, and absence from existing geriatric toxicity models. This review proposes a translational roadmap that prioritizes (1) standardization of salivary cortisol/DHEA(S) protocols; (2) prospective, age-stratified validation studies using standardized toxicity endpoints; (3) interventional testing of behavioral or pharmacological strategies to modulate HPA function; and (4) integration into oncology workflows and electronic decision-support tools. Incorporating endocrine biomarkers into risk prediction could refine treatment stratification, enable targeted supportive care, and ultimately improve outcomes for older patients with cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Podobnik G, Ibragimov B, Peterlin P, Strojan P, Vrtovec T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111387'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111387&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41581701/'&gt;41581701&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To extend the previously reported geometric analysis of HaN-Seg: The Head and Neck Organ-at-Risk CT and MR Segmentation Challenge by integrating a dosimetric evaluation, thereby offering a comprehensive assessment of challenge results with practical insights into their clinical applicability. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participating teams of the HaN-Seg challenge were tasked to auto-segment 30 organs-at-risk (OARs) in the head and neck region using paired contrast-enhanced computed tomography and T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. The teams were ranked according to their geometric performance, measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and 95th-percentile Hausdorff distance (HD95). Here, we extend this evaluation with a forward dosimetric analysis, also known as dosimetric impact approximation, including the verification of OAR dosimetric restriction compliance, assessment of OAR priority ratings, evaluation of segmentation performance relative to tumor proximity, and correlation analysis between geometric and dosimetric metrics. RESULTS: All six teams from the previous geometric analysis were assessed for dosimetric performance on the original 14 test cases. Dosimetric analysis revealed minor performance differences among teams, with the best- and worst-performing teams achieving dosimetric compliance in 70.7% and 67.7% of OAR auto-segmentations, respectively. Most teams successfully met priority 1 dosimetric restrictions including the spinal cord, brainstem, optic chiasm, and optic nerves in 11 out of 14 test cases. The lowest compliance rates were observed for the oral cavity and submandibular glands. Correlation analysis revealed no clear relationship between geometric and dosimetric metrics. CONCLUSION: The high dosimetric compliance highlights the practical utility of deep learning OAR auto-segmentation methods. Lower compliance for the oral cavity and submandibular glands most probably stems from their proximity to tumors and the corresponding steep dose gradients, where certain dosimetric constraints are inherently challenging to meet in clinical practice, or from the limitations of the forward dosimetric analysis. These findings underpin the critical need for both geometric and dosimetric evaluations of OAR auto-segmentation tools to ensure robust validation. Such a comprehensive assessment will be essential as commercial deep learning tools become increasingly integrated into the radiotherapy planning workflow.</description>

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 3869 advanced CC patients from South Korea's cancer registry (2012-2019), alongside claims and death records (2012-2021). Among these 2792 patients diagnosed after bevacizumab's NHI inclusion (August 2015), survival outcomes were compared between those receiving bevacizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 1787, 64.0%) versus chemotherapy alone (n = 1005, 36.0%). Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: Following NHI coverage of bevacizumab, median OS increased from 1.5 to 2.5 years, and the 5-year OS rate increased from 25.6% to 41.4% (weighted hazard ratio [wHR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.67). Among patients receiving bevacizumab, median OS was 2.6 years compared to 2.2 years for those not receiving bevacizumab, with 5-year OS rates of 42.0% and 40.2%, respectively (wHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). Subgroup analyses revealed that bevacizumab was associated with significantly better OS in patients with prior concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) history (wHR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75), regardless of histologic subtype (squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]: wHR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.78] vs. non-SCC: wHR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55-0.79]). Conclusions: The national investment in the implementation of bevacizumab was associated with favorable survival outcomes in advanced CC patients. Particularly, bevacizumab showed pronounced survival benefit for patients with prior CCRT history, regardless of histologic subtype.</description>

The classic variant (cPTC) is characterized by indolent behavior and excellent prognosis. However, rare subtypes of PTC most often exhibit adverse clinical behavior. The aim of the study was to assess the aggressiveness of rare variants of PTC by analyzing clinicopathological characteristics (CPCs) and survival outcomes. METHODS: We analyzed 80 patients with rare PTC variants treated between 2009 and 2019 who were compared with cPTC and matched with a control group for age and tumor size. The variants were categorized into high-risk (HRV: tall cell, diffuse sclerosing, columnar cell, and hobnail variants), intermediate-risk (IRV: solid variant (SV)), and low-risk (LRV: oncocytic (OV) and Warthin-like (WLV)) variants. Different CPCs (capsule and blood vessel invasion, lymphonodal metastases, microscopic and macroscopic extrathyroid extension, multifocal and bilateral presentation) and survival outcomes-overall (OS), disease-specific (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared. RESULTS: HRVs exhibited significantly more aggressive CPCs and worse OS, DSS, and DFS compared to cPTC (p &lt; 0.001). IRVs showed no significant difference in CPCs or survival outcomes compared to cPTC. LRVs showed excellent survival but were associated with several unfavorable CPCs. Multivariate analysis identified classification in HRVs as the only independent predictor of recurrence (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Tumors in the HRV group should retain their status as aggressive PTC variants due to unfavorable behavior and poorer prognosis. SVs, despite earlier assumptions, do not exhibit aggressive characteristics. Although the OV and WLV have similar survival to cPTC, their potential for adverse CPCs requires caution.</description>

Targeting epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) alterations with overall response rates of more than 80% has provided a paradigm shift in the treatment of NSCLC; however, NSCLC patients harbouring uncommon mutations and exon 20 insertions still have a dismal prognosis underscoring the urgent need to develop novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with proven activity against these EGFR alterations. Zipalertinib is a newly developed oral, irreversible compound which is characterized by its unique pyrrolopyrimidine structure which discriminates this novel TKI from others. It is active against the classical mutations (i.e., del19, L858R) and some of the uncommon mutations (e.g., T790M, G719X, S768I, L861Q, but not C797S) and is predominantly active in NSCLC cells harbouring exon20ins. Zipalertinib is currently being extensively evaluated in several clinical NSCLC trials (REZILIENT 1-4) and has shown significant clinical activity in NSCLC patients with uncommon mutations, exon20ins, and in brain metastases (REZILIENT 3 trial). Moreover, zipalertinib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by zipalertinib monotherapy as first-line therapy is currently being evaluated in the pivotal, ongoing REZILIENT 3 randomized trial. In addition, the efficacy of zipalertinib is also studied in the adjuvant setting (REZILIENT 4 trial, stage IB-IIIA NSCLCs with exon20ins and uncommon mutations). The role and the integration of therapies targeting exon20ins or uncommon mutations into the first- and second-line treatment armamentarium for NSCLC patients is not yet fully established, and the therapeutic impact of monotherapies (e.g., sunvozertinib, firmonertinib) versus combinations with standard platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., zipalertinib, amivantamab) currently still lacks robust evidence to further change the therapeutic landscape for these patients. Therefore, results from the ongoing trials are eagerly awaited and are expected to shed some light on these open questions.</description>

Methods: A total of 182 patients diagnosed with GEA at our center during the period 2014-2025 were included in this study. Nineteen GEA cases, 6 HPV-independent non-GEA cases, 59 HPV-associated usual endocervical adenocarcinoma cases, and 66 squamous cell carcinoma cases from online database were also included. Results: Vaginal bleeding (39.56%) and watery discharge (35.16%) were the most common symptoms. As many as 21.43% of patients had no specific complaints, and 80% of GEA showed no distinct mass through gynecological examination. A total of 64% of GEA were stage IIB-IV at diagnosis, with a 5-year survival of 41% versus 85% for stage I-IIA (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), lymph node metastasis, and ovarian metastasis were 49.64%, 42.00%, and 29.29%, respectively. The 5-year survival and recurrence rates after primary therapy were 57% and 23%, respectively. For GEA treatment, surgery might be associated with improved overall survival for the population at stage III-IV. Survival analysis identified deep infiltration depth (≥2/3), a maximum diameter of the tumor (MDOT) of ≥3 cm, and ovary metastasis as potential indicators of worse OS and PFS for whole patients. Additionally, ovary metastasis indicated poor PFS and OS for stage I-II. Genomic information TP53 mutation, PTEN deletion and STK11 mutation might be the most prevalent genomic alterations. Conclusions: These findings indicated GEA as an aggressive cervical cancer, with high rate of lymph node metastasis, high recurrence rate and short 5-year survival. Ovary metastasis reflected advanced disease burden and surgery might be associated with improved survival in advanced stage. For genomic information, GEA showed genetic heterogeneity and a low level of genomic instability.</description>

Historically, induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, as established by the CROSS trial, became the standard of care for locally advanced disease due to improvements in R0 resection rates and overall survival. More recently, the ESOPEC trial reexamined this paradigm in esophageal adenocarcinoma, demonstrating superior survival and improved systemic disease control with perioperative chemotherapy using the FLOT regimen compared with chemoradiotherapy. In parallel, the MATTERHORN trial further advanced perioperative treatment by showing improved event-free survival with the addition of the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab to FLOT chemotherapy. Alongside these systemic therapy advances, surgical management has transitioned toward minimally invasive and robotic-assisted esophagectomy, offering equivalent oncologic outcomes with reduced perioperative morbidity. This review summarizes the evolving evidence from pivotal clinical trials, highlights ongoing studies integrating immunotherapy, and discusses emerging strategies such as adoptive cell transfer which currently is under investigation for metastatic recurrence, but in the future may provide additional treatment options for resectable esophageal cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yang C, Alvarado D, Ravindran PK, Keizer ME, Hovinga K, Broen MPG, Kunst HPM, Temel Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18020289'&gt;10.3390/cancers18020289&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41595208/'&gt;41595208&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: The vestibular schwannoma (VS) is the most common cerebellopontine angle tumor in adults, exhibiting a highly variable natural history, from stability to rapid growth. Accurate, the non-invasive prediction of tumor behavior is essential to guide personalized management and avoid overtreatment or delayed intervention. Objective: To systematically review and synthesize the evidence on MRI-based biomarkers for predicting VS growth and treatment responses. Methods: We conducted a PRISMA-compliant search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2025, addressing MRI predictors of VS growth. Cohort studies evaluating texture features, signal intensity ratios, perfusion parameters, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) metrics were included. Study quality was assessed using the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) score, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), and ROBIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews) tool. Data on diagnostic performance, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and p value, were extracted and descriptively analyzed. Results: Ten cohort studies (five retrospective, five prospective, total n = 525 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Texture analysis metrics, such as kurtosis and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, yielded AUCs of 0.65-0.99 for predicting volumetric or linear growth thresholds. Signal intensity ratios on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images for tumor/temporalis muscle achieved a 100% sensitivity and 93.75% specificity. Perfusion MRI parameters (Ktrans, ve, ASL, and DSC derived blood-flow metrics) differentiated growing from stable tumors with AUCs up to 0.85. ADC changes post-gamma knife surgery predicted a favorable response, though the baseline ADC had limited value for natural growth prediction. The heterogeneity in growth definitions, MRI protocols, and retrospective designs remains a key limitation. Conclusions: MRI-based biomarkers may provide exploratory signals associated with VS growth and treatment responses. However, substantial heterogeneity in growth definitions and MRI protocols, small single-center cohorts, and the absence of external validation currently limit clinical implementation.</description>

The aim of this study is to evaluate hybrid [18F]FDG PET/MRI's diagnostic accuracy in EC staging and role in predicting tumor aggressiveness, molecular characterization, and recurrence. Methods: A prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov, ID:NCT04212910) evaluating EC patients undergoing [18F]FDG PET/MRI before surgery (2018-2024). Histology, immunohistochemistry, and patients' follow-up (mean FU time: 3.13y) were used as the reference standard. [18F]FDG PET/MRI, PET only, and MRI only were independently reviewed to assess the diagnostic accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and positive/negative predictive value (PPV, NPV). Imaging parameters were extracted from [18F]FDG PET and pcT1w, T2w, DWI, and DCE MRI. Spearman's correlations, Fisher's exact test, ROC-AUC analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were applied. Results: Eighty participants with primary EC (median age 63 ± 12 years) were enrolled, with 17% showing LN involvement. [18F]FDG PET/MRI provided ACC = 98.75%, SN = 98.75%, and PPV = 100% for primary tumor detection, and ACC = 92.41%, SN = 84.62%, SP = 93.94%, PPV = 73.33%, and NPV = 96.88% for LN detection. PET/MRI parameters predicted LN involvement (AUC = 79.49%), deep myometrial invasion (79.78%), lymphovascular space invasion (82.00%), p53abn (71.47%), MMRd (74.51%), relapse (82.00%), and postoperative administration of adjuvant therapy (79.64%). Patients with a tumor cranio-caudal diameter ≥ 43 mm and MTV ≥ 13.5 cm3 showed increased probabilities of recurrence (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: [18F]FDG PET/MR showed exceptional accuracy in EC primary tumor and LN detection. Derived parameters demonstrated potential ability in defining features of aggressiveness, molecular alterations, and tumor recurrence.</description>

This review discusses the unique molecular characteristics of cemiplimab, a newer anti-PD-1 antibody, and defines its optimal positioning against established standards. Cemiplimab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody distinguished by two key features: an engineered hinge-region mutation that prevents Fab-arm exchange, ensuring exceptional molecular stability which minimizes anti-drug antibody (ADA) risks associated with unstable molecules; and a unique interaction with PD-1 glycosylation sites, potentially enhancing binding efficacy. These structural advantages may be particularly relevant in histologies like squamous NSCLC, where accumulating somatic mutations drive high neoantigen loads and heightened immune responses, creating an environment historically prone to ADA formation. Based on data from the pivotal EMPOWER-Lung program, we highlight cemiplimab's exceptional promise in specific populations. Firstly, in the EMPOWER-Lung 1 trial, cemiplimab monotherapy demonstrated extraordinary survival benefits in a pre-specified analysis of the distinct "ultra-high" PD-L1 expression subgroup (TPS ≥90%), potentially surpassing historical benchmarks. Secondly, cemiplimab displays consistent, robust efficacy in challenging-to-treat squamous histology, both as monotherapy for patients with high PD-L1 expression and in combination with chemotherapy for patients with PD-L1 &lt; 50%. In conclusion, cemiplimab establishes a unique therapeutic niche for patients with squamous histology and ultra-high PD-L1 expression, likely driven by its distinct structural stability and reduced immunogenicity.</description>

However, robust data regarding the efficacy and safety of this approach specifically in patients aged 75 years and older are scarce, as this population is frequently underrepresented in pivotal clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the real-world treatment outcomes and safety profile of first-line immunotherapy in patients aged ≥75 years with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center cohort study. Sixty-one patients aged ≥75 years with histologically confirmed, advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (stage III/IV) who initiated first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy/antiangiogenic therapy) between February 2021 and May 2025 were included. Assessments included tumor response per RECIST 1.1, progression-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events graded per the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria v5.0. RESULTS: The median age was 80 years. The objective response rate was 45.9% (28/61), and the disease control rate was 85.2%. After a median follow-up of 16.7 months, the median progression-free survival was 12.7 months (95% CI: 6.9-17.1), and the median overall survival was 17.7 months (95% CI: 10.7-22.8). Both progression-free survival and overall survival significantly differed among response groups (log-rank p &lt; 0.0001). Treatment was generally tolerable. Any-grade immune-related adverse events occurred in 39.1% of patients, with grade ≥3 events in 1.6%. Non-immune toxicities were common (any grade 93.1%; grade ≥3 in 14.7%), primarily hematologic. CONCLUSION: In this real-world cohort, first-line immunotherapy demonstrated promising efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients aged ≥75 years with advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These findings provide valuable preliminary evidence supporting the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this understudied population and highlight the need for prospective validation to optimize therapeutic strategies.</description>

Increasing evidence suggests that the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), including immune cell composition and spatial organization, plays a critical role in tumor progression and survival outcomes. This study aimed to characterize immune cell density and geospatial clustering patterns within the TIME of PSCC and to evaluate their associations with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) was performed on tumor samples from 57 patients with PSCC using a panel of immune markers to identify lymphoid and myeloid cell populations. Immune cell densities were quantified within tumoral and stromal compartments. Spatial relationships among immune cells and between immune cells and tumor cells were analyzed using point pattern analysis. Survival outcomes, including overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS), were assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models, with analyses stratified by nodal and human papillomavirus (HPV) status. RESULTS: Higher intratumoral and stromal densities of pro-immunogenic M1 macrophages were associated with improved OS. Increased densities of CD3+CD4+ helper T cells in both compartments were also associated with favorable survival outcomes. In contrast, close clustering of pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages with tumor cells and with one another was associated with worse OS, RFS, and CSS. Bivariate clustering of helper T cells with tumor cells was associated with improved OS, including among patients with node-positive disease. Survival outcomes did not differ significantly by HPV status in patients with high helper T cell clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Immune cell density and spatial organization within the TIME are associated with survival outcomes in PSCC. Favorable patterns involving helper T cells and M1 macrophages correlate with improved survival, whereas clustering of M2 macrophages is associated with poorer outcomes, supporting the relevance of spatial immune profiling in this disease.</description>

This study examined temporal changes in the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of malignant tumors in an HIV cohort in Japan. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 3793 men treated for HIV at Osaka National Hospital between 2007 and 2024. Diagnoses of malignant tumors were identified from medical records and the expected numbers of cases were calculated using cancer incidence rates for the general male population of Japan. SIRs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and temporal changes across four periods (2007-2011, 2012-2016, 2017-2020, and 2021-2024) were evaluated using the p for trend. Results: The overall SIR for malignant tumors decreased from 5.12 (95% CI: 4.02-6.43) in 2007-2011 to 0.86 (95% CI: 0.64-1.14) in 2021-2024, mainly owing to a decline in ADMs (SIR: 111.93 to 5.70), including Kaposi's sarcoma (SIR: 4269.39 to 547.26) and AIDS-related lymphoma (SIR: 62.18 to 3.13). The overall SIR for NADMs was similar to that of the general population (1.04; 95% CI: 0.89-1.22), and decreased from 1.64 to 0.69, but the risks of anal cancer (SIR 40.63) and oral/pharyngeal cancer (SIR 3.16) remained high. Conclusions: Among men with HIV in Japan, the overall risk of ADMs and NADMs has decreased; however, the risk of specific NADMs remains high. Cancer prevention strategies for PWH need to focus on high-risk NADMs.</description>

METHODS: In this study, 390 elderly patients with EC treated in the First Affiliated Hospital of Naval Medical University from January, 2023 to June, 2024 were selected as the training group, and 165 elderly patients with EC treated in Qingdao Hiser Hospital Affiliated of Qingdao University from July, 2024 to July, 2025 were selected as the validation group. A cross-sectional study was used for data collection. Three types of assessment tools were used, including the self-made general information questionnaire, outcome variable assessment scale and candidate variable assessment scale. The patients were divided into two groups according to the occurrence of oral frailty. LASSO regression and multivariate analysis were performed using SPSS 27.0 and R 4.4.3 software to identify the independent risk factors for oral frailty. The Bootstrap method with 1000 repeated samplings was used for internal validation of the model, while external validation was conducted using data from the validation group. The performance of the model was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, decision curve analysis (DCA) and other indicators, and the Nomogram was drawn to visualize the model. RESULTS: The incidence of oral frailty in the training group and validation group was 45.90% and 43.03%, respectively. The results showed that radiotherapy history, tumor staging, physical frailty, smoking history, age, and nutritional status were independent risk factors for oral frailty in elderly patients with EC (P&lt; 0.05). The area under the ROC curve of the training group and the validation group were 0.812 (95% CI: 0.771-0.853) and 0.796 (95% CI: 0.730-0.862), respectively. Hosmer-Lemeshow test results (χ2 = 12.382, P = 0.193) and (χ2 = 14.922, P = 0.093) indicated that the model had a good goodness of fit. The consistency between the actual value of the calibration curve and the predicted value was high. The DCA results suggested that the model could obtain net benefits within a large threshold probability in both internal and external validation. CONCLUSION: The risk of oral frailty in elderly patients with EC is high, which is related to radiotherapy history, tumor staging, physical frailty, smoking history, age, nutritional status and other factors. The oral frailty risk prediction model for elderly patients with EC constructed in this study has good predictive efficacy in internal and external validation, which can provide a reference for medical staff to identify high-risk groups early and take targeted intervention measures.</description>

A critical unmet need exists for non-invasive, accurate diagnostic tools for early detection. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a robust machine learning model based on a panel of serum tumor markers for the early prediction of NSCLC and its differentiation from benign pulmonary conditions. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we recruited 2,283 participants, including 1,339 with NSCLC, 313 with pneumonia, 260 with biopsy-confirmed benign lesions, and 371 with other benign lung masses. Serum levels of six key tumor markers-Squamous Cell Carcinoma Antigen (SCCA), Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA), Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125), Cytokeratin 19 Fragment (CYFRA21-1), Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE), and Pro-Gastrin-Releasing Peptide (ProGRP)-were quantified, and a custom deep neural network, LungPanelNet, was constructed for the classification task. RESULTS: The model demonstrated superior predictive performance on an independent testing set, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96), with an accuracy of 89.3%, a sensitivity of 91.5%, and a specificity of 87.8%. Feature importance analysis identified SCCA and CYFRA21-1 as the most significant predictors. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that a machine learning model integrating a panel of serum tumor markers can effectively distinguish NSCLC from a spectrum of benign pulmonary conditions with high accuracy. This approach shows promise as a clinical decision-support tool, though further validation in larger, prospective, multi-center cohorts is warranted. This was a retrospective cohort study without clinical trial registration.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted including two distinct datasets: six patients with histopathologically confirmed ocular MEC treated at our institution and twenty-one cases identified through literature review. Institutional cases were evaluated for clinical course, treatment, and recurrence, whereas literature-derived cases were summarized descriptively due to reporting heterogeneity and incomplete follow-up. RESULTS: Patients in the institutional cohort (n = 6) had a median age of 64 years, with no sex predominance. The lacrimal gland was the most frequent primary site, followed by the eyelid and lacrimal sac. The predominant manifestation was a painless orbital mass, while diplopia and visual loss were less frequent. Intermediate-grade lesions were most common, and orbital tissue invasion was histologically confirmed in two patients. Both patients with invasion experienced tumor recurrence, whereas no recurrence was observed among patients without invasion during follow-u No disease-related deaths occurred within this cohort. The literature-derived group demonstrated substantial variability in grading, invasion patterns, and follow-up duration, reflecting selective reporting toward advanced or recurrent cases. CONCLUSIONS: Ocular MEC demonstrates a high tendency toward local recurrence but generally low disease-specific mortality. Orbital tissue invasion appears to be associated with an elevated risk of recurrence in the institutional cohort, underscoring the need for prolonged surveillance. Given the marked heterogeneity of published cases, survival inference should be limited to consistently followed institutional data.</description>

Older women face underrecognized risks due to age-related immune decline and inadequate screening, highlighting the need for targeted research. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 640 women aged ≥50 years who underwent cervical HPV testing at a tertiary hospital in Kuqa, Xinjiang, from January 2024 to March 2025. A priori sample size calculation indicated a minimum requirement of 544 participants, which was exceeded. Sociodemographic (age, education), behavioral (sexual activity frequency, smoking and alcohol use), and clinical variables (age at menopause, parity, history of cervical surgery, body mass index [BMI]) were extracted from medical records. HPV status and genotypes were detected using a PCR-based DNA microarray, and cervical pathology was classified according to WHO criteria. Statistical analyses were preceded by assessment of variable normality. Analyses included descriptive statistics, binary and ordinal logistic regression, chi-square tests, t-tests/ANOVA, and point-biserial correlation analysis (SPSS 26.0; p&lt;0.05). RESULTS: The overall HPV prevalence was 20.6% (132/640), with high-risk genotypes HPV16 (29.5%), HPV53 (18.2%), and HPV58 (12.1%) being the most prevalent. Binary logistic regression showed that a history of cervical surgery (e.g., conization) was strongly associated with a reduced likelihood of HPV positivity (OR=0.015, 95% CI: 0.008--0.028, p&lt;0.001). Univariate analysis indicated that sexual activity frequency was higher in HPV-positive than HPV-negative women (2.35 ± 1.14 vs. 2.11 ± 1.10, t=2.225, p=0.026), but this association was not significant in the multivariate model (OR=1.020, 95% CI: 0.796--1.307, p=0.874). Point-biserial correlation analysis revealed a negative association between HPV positivity and BMI (r_pb=-0.088, p&lt;0.05). HPV-positive women had a higher rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared with HPV-negative women (31.1% vs. 1.2%, p&lt;0.001). A post hoc power analysis for the cervical surgery-HPV association yielded a power &gt;99.9%. CONCLUSION: Women aged ≥50 years in Xinjiang have a non-negligible HPV prevalence, with HPV16 and HPV53 as dominant genotypes. A history of cervical surgery was associated with a markedly lower likelihood of HPV detection in this cross-sectional analysis. The association between sexual activity frequency and HPV status was not consistent across analyses and requires cautious interpretation. HPV positivity was strongly correlated with cervical pathological lesions, emphasizing the urgency of tailored screening and prevention strategies for this population.</description>

The development of this malignancy is associated with numerous risk factors; however, its primary etiology often remains unclear. Research on the potential association between breast cancer and carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) has been conducted for three decades, yet a definitive consensus has not been reached. The development of prophylactic cervical cancer vaccines has greatly heightened the urgency of this issue: if a causal relationship can be established, it would open a feasible avenue for preventing this common cancer. This review aims to systematically integrate relevant evidence and provide a critical commentary on the association between HPV and breast cancer. We analyzed evidence from 34 studies on HPV DNA detection in breast cancer cells. We discuss the prevalence and genotypes of HPV detected in breast cancer across different geographical regions, the state of the viral genome (integrated vs. episomal), viral load, and potential mechanisms for HPV-associated breast carcinogenesis-particularly its role in inducing genomic instability via activation of APOBEC3B. Additionally, we explore the histopathological and clinical characteristics of HPV-positive breast cancer. The synthesized evidence suggests that high-risk HPV types are present in a subset of breast cancers worldwide, but with lower viral loads compared to cervical cancer, indicating a potentially different mode of action. The association between HPV and breast cancer warrants further rigorous investigation to clarify its clinical and preventive implications.</description>

METHODS: This study included 108 enhanced CT scans of colon cancer, including 68 cases of ascending colon, 14 cases of transverse colon, 18 cases of descending colon, and 8 cases of sigmoid colon; there were 56 cases of MSI-H and 52 cases of microsatellite stability (MSS). In the first stage, the segmentation model MSI-SAM was trained to accurately segment the lesion locations in the CT scans. In the second stage, the mask acquired from the MSI-SAM segmentation was multiplied by the original CT image (CT_Origin) bitwise, and the result was merged with the mask obtained from the MSI-SAM segmentation (Segment) to obtain CT_ROI. Both CT_ROI and CT_Origin were then diagnosed using the colon cancer MSI status diagnosis model. RESULTS: The performance of the suggested CT segmentation model MSI-SAM in the ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, and sigmoid colon areas (DSC: IoU) was (0.886:0.798), (0.878:0.783), (0.923:0.857), and (0.854:0.747), respectively. The AUC of the MSI status diagnostic model for patients with colon cancer was 0.935 (95% CI 0.892-0.947), the ACC was 0.913, the sensitivity was 1.000, and the specificity was 0.846. CONCLUSIONS: The segmentation masks created by the trained deep learning segmentation model achieved a level comparable to that of expert radiologists, and the deep learning diagnostic model played an essential role in supporting doctors in diagnosis.</description>

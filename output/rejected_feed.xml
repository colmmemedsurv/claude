      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Itoh N, Okumura N, Akazawa-Kai N, Wachino C, Kuriki S, Kawabata T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0340599'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0340599&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41628185/'&gt;41628185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since antimicrobial shortages are becoming common owing to manufacturing issues and sudden demand, individualized antimicrobial optimization by infectious disease specialists is essential. We evaluated the effects of a 12-month antimicrobial stewardship program at a university-affiliated hospital in Japan during antimicrobial shortages. In this single-center retrospective observational study, from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2025, we compared the pre-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program without infectious disease specialists) and post-intervention (antimicrobial stewardship program with infectious disease specialists and formal consultation service) periods. The evaluated outcomes included antimicrobial use, microbiological indicators (number of culture specimens submitted and hospital-acquired resistant organisms), patient outcomes (in-hospital mortality and length of hospital stay), and antimicrobial costs. A Bayesian structural time-series analysis adjusted for seasonality was used to assess intervention effects. In total, 24,601 inpatients were included (11,782 before intervention and 12,819 after). Shortages affected nine intravenous and two oral antibiotics. The antimicrobial stewardship program team provided 1110 feedback instances (acceptance rate, 74.1%) and conducted 172 infectious disease consultations in the post-intervention period. Carbapenem use, antipseudomonal agent use, incidence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the cost of carbapenems per patient-day significantly decreased. Narrow-spectrum antibiotic use, anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agent use, all intravenous antimicrobial use, total intravenous and oral antimicrobials, and the number of inpatient specimens were significantly increased. All antimicrobial costs, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay remained unchanged. Antimicrobial stewardship program supported by infectious disease specialists/consultants significantly reduced carbapenem and antipseudomonal agent use without negatively affecting patient outcomes. These findings highlight infectious disease specialists' critical role in supporting effective antimicrobial stewardship programs, particularly during limited antimicrobial supply and increased clinical complexity.</description>

METHODS: We performed a single center, randomized clinical trial (EudraCT 2020-001852-16) in which patients with severe covid-19 in need of hospitalization were randomized in two groups. The first group received 12.5 mg oral iodine for 8 days, the second group did not receive iodine next to the standard of care. Primary endpoints were deterioration of disease defined as transfer from the ward to the intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Next to these parameters we collected parameters in line with the recommendations made by the WHO in the early days of the pandemic. On these additional datasets we performed an exploratory analysis and investigated possible confounders and trends. The inclusion phase of the study was between October 2020 and April 2022. Finally, in vitro validations were performed. RESULTS: Outcomes from 141 participants were analyzed, revealing no significant differences in mortality or transfers to intensive care between the iodine-treated group (67 patients) and the control group (74 patients). In an exploratory analysis we found that patients randomized to receive oral iodine had a significantly shorter stay at the ICU (p = 0.016). In vitro validations proved increased virus-induced type I interferon responses upon iodine administration in pulmonary cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that while iodine does not reduce mortality or ICU admissions, it may enhance antiviral immunity through increased type I interferon responses, contributing to shorter ICU stays in COVID-19 patients. The role of iodine in enhancing IFN-I mediated antiviral immunity warrants future research.

All data on severe periodontitis used in this study were derived from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. Annual years lived with disability (YLDs) and their estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) were calculated and stratified by year, age, geographical region, and socio-demographic index (SDI) at global, regional, and national levels. Decomposition analysis assessed the contributions of demographic and epidemiological factors to the evolving burden of severe periodontitis. A frontier analysis identified areas for improvement and disparities among countries based on development levels. Distributional inequalities were measured using the slope index of inequality (SII) and concentration index. The autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) was used to project the disease burden up to 2036. In 2021, there were 6,903.28 thousand YLDs (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 2,772.28-14,106.18 thousand) attributed to severe periodontitis globally. Between 1990 and 2021, the global age-standardized rate (ASR) of YLDs showed a stable trend, increasing slightly from 79.62 (95% UI: 31.46-169.62) to 80.89 (95% UI: 32.47-165.37) with an EAPC of 0.08% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.03 to 0.18). Population growth accounted for 66.73% of the global increase in YLDs. SII values rose from 12.72 (95% CI: 1.92-23.52) in 1990 to 44.99 (95% CI: 31.14-58.85) in 2021, while the concentration index decreased from 0.05 (95% CI: -0.04 to 0.13) in 1990 to 0.035 (95% CI: -0.06 to 0.13). According to the forecasts, the global ASR of YLDs for severe periodontitis is projected to show a slight decline over the next 15 years. Significant potential exists for reducing the burden of severe periodontitis across countries, irrespective of their development levels. Severe periodontitis remains a significant global health challenge, with substantial cross-country disparities that persist despite overall stable trends in global YLDs. Targeted interventions and policies are urgently needed to address these disparities, focusing on improving oral health outcomes across all countries, regardless of their socio-demographic development levels.</description>

Evidence from LMICs indicates that intravenous (IV) iron formulations such as ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) are safe and effective alternatives to oral iron, and there is emerging data on implementation strategies and outcomes. Client outcomes are important additional considerations for successful scale-up of new interventions. We assessed patient experiences and satisfaction among women receiving IV versus oral iron for anaemia in pregnancy in Nigeria. METHODS: This mixed-methods study was nested in a type 1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial that enrolled 1,056 pregnant women at 20-32 weeks gestational age. Participants were randomised to receive either FCM or oral ferrous sulphate (FS). Twenty-five percent of participants were sequentially sampled for interviewer-administered exit surveys and 66 women who received IV iron were purposively selected for in-depth interviews at last study visit. Quantitative data from the two treatment groups were evaluated using the Chi-squared test, while qualitative data were analysed thematically. RESULTS: We surveyed 252 women (128 treated with FCM and 124 with FS). Significantly higher proportions of the FCM (73.4%) versus FS group (57.3%) had positive perceptions of care (p = 0.007). Positive perceptions, experiences and satisfaction with FCM were buttressed by the qualitative findings, for reasons such as good communication and quality of provider care, single-dose administration, minimal side effects, positive health outcomes and not bearing treatment costs. CONCLUSION: Participants in this IV versus oral iron trial had positive perceptions of FCM. These patient-reported findings support available evidence on service and implementation outcomes and further support IV iron scale up in LMIC settings. Future implementation research should further assess client outcomes under real-world conditions.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective dataset of 12,742 annotated frames from 55 laryngoscopy video recordings was annotated with bounding boxes identifying vocal fold polyps. Pretrained YOLO11 and YOLO12 models were fine-tuned to detect the polyps in the frames. A temporal tracking algorithm was further developed to propagate missed detections across adjacent frames. RESULTS: YOLO12 outperformed YOLO11 across all metrics. On the hold-out test set, YOLO12 reached a precision of 83.1% and an F1 score of 67.6%, with a mean average precision at 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 64.1%. By comparison, YOLO11 achieved a precision of 67.3% and an F1 score of 56.2%, with a mAP@0.5 of 56.0%. Incorporating temporal tracking increased mAP@0.5 to 70.4% with YOLO 12, while maintaining a detection speed of 21.4 frames per second (fps), close to real time (30 fps). CONCLUSIONS: Using YOLO 12 for vocal fold polyp detection in stroboscopy was enhanced with temporal tracking, achieving a mAP@0.5 of 70.4% with near real time performance. These results demonstrate the potential of real-time AI-assisted detection of vocal fold lesions.</description>

METHODS: Patients who underwent head and neck reconstruction with either FFF, MSAP, or ALT were included. The primary outcome was functional recovery, assessed using the modified LEFS, a PROM measuring functional status, administered at multiple post-operative timepoints. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were included in the analysis: 33 FFF, 22 MSAP and 20 ALT. Patients undergoing lower extremity free flap surgery overall recovered well. The LEFS scores at different time points demonstrated quicker recovery for the MSAP group, while ALT and FFF recovered later. After 360 days, the MSAP group also demonstrated improved functional outcomes compared to the ALT and FFF. CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing lower extremity free flap surgery recover well. The MSAP had the least donor-site morbidity. Donor-site morbidity should be considered when counseling patients.</description>

METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of 69 patients (78.3% male) from two Chinese hospitals assessed ulcer characteristics, pain (VAS), micronutrient levels, and psychological scores (SCARED, DSRSC, CPRS, SDQ). Statistical analysis used nonparametric tests and correlation analysis (SPSS 26.0). RESULTS: Zinc deficiency (37.7%) correlated with longer disease duration (12.0 vs. 6.0 months, p = 0.035) and shorter ulcer-free intervals (60.0 vs. 95.2 days, p = 0.040). Zinc levels inversely linked to emotional symptoms (r = -0.416, p = 0.022) but positively to prosocial behavior (r = 0.526, p = 0.003). Pain intensity associated with anxiety (VAS: 4.0 vs. 3.0, p = 0.025) and psychosocial distress (r = 0.461, p = 0.010). Older children (8-16 years) had longer disease duration (12.0 vs. 3.6 months, p &lt; 0.001) and higher zinc deficiency (47.5% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.048). Iron showed paradoxical associations with emotional symptoms (r = 0.452, p = 0.012) and prosocial behavior (r = -0.382, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: Zinc deficiency and psychological factors critically influence the chronicity of FOU. Multidisciplinary care combining micronutrient supplementation and behavioral interventions is recommended.</description>

Nowadays, newer possibilities are offered by micro-needles as an effective transmucosal drug delivery. The aim of this single-blinded randomized clinical trial was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of micro-needling (MN) as a novel technique for transmucosal delivery of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) and hyaluronic acid (HA) on symptomatic OLP lesions. METHODS: Twenty volunteers with bilateral symptomatic OLP lesions were randomly assigned to the study involving four different treatment groups (G): G1, topical TA alone; G2, MN as an adjunct to the topical TA; G3, topical TA and HA; and G4, MN as an adjunct to the topical TA and HA. Lesions were assessed at baseline, and on Days 7, 14, 28, and 56 using parameters including the percentage healing index (PHI), reticulation/erythema/ulceration (REU) score, and visual analogue scale (VAS). Statistical analysis was then performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: Twenty patients (40 lesions; 10 per group) were included. G4 showed a significantly higher PHI compared to both G1 (p   &lt; $$ &lt; $$  0.001) and G3 (p &lt; 0.05) at all observation times. Regarding the REU score, G4 achieved significantly greater reductions compared to G1 at all observation times (p &lt; 0.05), compared to G2 on Days 7, 28, and 56 (p &lt; 0.05), and compared to G3 on Days 28 and 56 (p &lt; 0.05). Regarding the VAS, both G2 and G4 showed a statistically significant reduction on Day 7 compared to G1 and G3 (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study uncovered the advantages of MN in promoting healing, reducing severity, and alleviating pain in OLP patients. Therefore, MN has the potential to become an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality for symptomatic OLP. Moreover, the adjunctive use of MN with topical application of both TA and HA demonstrated the most significant therapeutic benefits, suggesting a synergistic effect.

Otolaryngologic manifestations often precede systemic symptoms but are commonly misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis or infection, delaying treatment and increasing the risk of irreversible renal damage. AIM: This review aimed to characterize otolaryngologic presentations in GPA and evaluate their correlation with renal involvement to improve early recognition and clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. They searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar up to July 2025. They included case reports and case series that described head and neck manifestations in patients with confirmed GPA. Two reviewers independently screened 784 records, selected 17 studies, and extracted data on clinical features, ANCA status, and renal outcomes. The Murad and JBI tools assessed methodological quality. RESULTS: Nasal crusting, epistaxis, septal perforation, and saddle-nose deformity were the most frequent otolaryngologic findings. Oral lesions, including ulcerations and "strawberry gingivitis," were less common but highly suggestive. Subglottic stenosis, otitis media with effusion, and orbital inflammation also occurred. Many patients received initial misdiagnoses, leading to treatment delays. Renal involvement, primarily glomerulonephritis, developed in most systemic cases, often concurrent with or shortly after severe ENT disease. Destructive lesions correlated strongly with renal complications. PR3-ANCA positivity ranged from 21 to 100%, with most studies reporting rates above 85%. Histopathologic confirmation was achieved through biopsies of nasal or gingival tissue. Immunosuppressive therapy-controlled disease activity, while surgery managed structural sequelae. CONCLUSION: Destructive otolaryngologic manifestations predicted renal involvement in GPA. Early biopsy, ANCA testing, and multidisciplinary management improved diagnostic accuracy and prevented organ damage. Future research should develop standardized ENT activity scores and prospective registries.</description>

Although multiple surgical techniques have been developed, their long-term outcomes remain inadequately defined. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of surgical interventions used to manage CSF rhinorrhea. METHODS: A comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library was conducted from database inception to March 2025. Studies evaluating any surgical interventions for managing CSF rhinorrhea and following the patients for at least one year were included. Our study outcomes were success, recurrence, and complication rates. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 18 BE. RESULTS: Our review encompassed 114 studies involving 4187 patients with CSF rhinorrhea. The endoscopic repair demonstrated a high primary success rate, estimated at 93% (1-2 years), 92% (2-5 years), and 91% (more than 5 years). Recurrence after endoscopic repair remained low, varying from 7% to 11%. Complications were uncommon, with meningitis reported in 1-2% of cases, sinusitis estimated at 1%, and headache from 1 to 3%. The craniotomy approach achieved a high primary success rate, reaching 95% at 1-2 years, then dropping to 75% at 2-5 years, and increasing again to 98% at &gt; 5 years. Additionally, the risk of recurrence (5-22%) and complications were generally higher after craniotomy (3-6%). CONCLUSION: Endoscopic repair demonstrated excellent long-term outcomes with minimal morbidity, supporting its role as the standard approach for most CSF rhinorrhea cases. Although craniotomy carries a higher risk of recurrence and complications, it remains appropriate for complex or frontal defects. Surgical management should be individualized according to defect site, CSF flow, and patient-specific factors to optimize outcomes. Nevertheless, we have some limitations as most included studies were observational and retrospective, and there was heterogeneity in study design and outcome reporting.</description>

Due to the lack of standardized outcome parameters for diagnosing SD or assessing its treatment over time, the evaluation of systematic clinical evidence on the effects of BoNT therapy on SD symptom control is difficult. The registry presented in this article aimed to evaluate outcomes after BoNT treatment in SD patients in Austria and Germany, based on selected subjective and objective voice parameters. METHODS: 41 patients with SD were included in this multicentric registry, after drop-out of 2 patients the results of 39/41 (95.1%) patients could be analyzed per protocol. Demographic and treatment characteristics as well as the occurrence of therapy-related side effects were recorded. Perceptual voice sound evaluation (RBH scale), voice range profile measurements (VRP), number of spasms, and severity of voice strain were assessed. Patients were asked to complete the Voice Handicap Index (VHI-9i), the Communicative Participation Item Bank (CPIB), and indicate their perceived phonation effort on a VAS scale. The parameters were compared between baseline and 1-month post-BoNT treatment. RESULTS: The patients received all BoNT type A (Xeomin®/Merz, Allergan®/Allergan or Dysport®/Ipsen). SD symptoms did not affect the frequency or dynamic range of the singing voice nor did they affect MPT; in contrast all the other parameters assessed were aberrant at baseline. BoNT treatment improved Jitter-%, Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI), degrees of roughness and hoarseness, but failed to restore them to normal. BoNT significantly reduced the voice spasm and strain. Phonation effort improved by approximately 50%. VHI-9i classification was reduced from moderate to mild after treatment, and CPIB from moderate to mild. The VHI-9i results were significantly positively correlated with the CPIB results. CONCLUSION: The results of this registry showed that BoNT injection, the current off-label treatment of SD symptoms, failed to restore normal voice quality. This registry's outcomes also indicate that the choice of the applied BoNT brand is site-specific and does not appear to be associated with differences in efficacy. We also showed that the effects of the BoNT on the SD symptoms are best described by semi-quantitative outcome measures such as spasm counts and voice strain, and by patients-reported outcome measures (PROMs), such as CPIB and VHI-9i than by more objective parameters such as frequency and dynamic range of the singing voice.</description>

With the increasing use of YouTube as a source of medical information, concerns have arisen regarding the accuracy and reliability of video content on this platform. This study aimed to evaluate the quality, reliability, and usefulness of English-language YouTube videos related to AH. METHODS: A total of 300 videos were screened using specific keywords, and 93 met the inclusion criteria. Videos were assessed for their general characteristics and classified as either useful or misleading based on scientific accuracy. The Global Quality Scale (GQS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), and JAMA benchmarks were used to evaluate video quality and reliability. RESULTS: Among the included videos, 78.5% were deemed useful, while 21.5% were misleading. Videos uploaded by academic institutions and physicians demonstrated significantly higher mDISCERN, GQS, and JAMA scores (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, the majority of misleading videos were uploaded by independent users. A strong correlation was found between viewer engagement metrics (likes, comments) and daily view counts (p &lt; 0.001), though higher popularity did not consistently align with higher quality or reliability. CONCLUSION: Although YouTube offers a substantial number of informative videos on AH, the presence of misleading content remains a concern, particularly from non-professional sources. Healthcare professionals and institutions are encouraged to produce high-quality, reliable video content to enhance public health literacy and counter misinformation.</description>

Senolytic drugs selectively eliminate senescent cells, offering a potential strategy to mitigate therapy-induced senescence (TIS) and improve cancer treatment outcomes. This review aimed to synthesize preclinical in vivo evidence evaluating the effects of senolytic and senogenic combination therapy on tumor burden and mechanistic outcomes, including senescence, SASP modulation, proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage markers. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, a literature search was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception to August 2025. Search terms included: "senolytic drugs," "cellular senescence," "senescence clearance," "therapy-induced senescence," "senomorphic drugs," "chemotherapy," "cancer treatment," "in vivo," and "xenograft," "PARP inhibitor," "CDK4/6 inhibitor," "BCL-2 inhibitor," "BH3-mimetic," and "BET inhibitor". Eligible studies included in vivo cancer models evaluating senolytic + senogenic combinations compared with the senogenic strategy alone, with outcomes related to tumor burden or mechanistic markers. Data extraction captured study design, animal model, tumor type, treatment regimen, and quantitative outcomes including senescence, SASP factors, proliferation, apoptosis, and DNA damage. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for preclinical studies. RESULTS: The initial search identified 1,262 articles, of which 36 fulfilled the inclusion criteria after screening. All included studies were therapeutic mechanistic in vivo investigations. Across cancer types including colorectal, breast, ovarian, lung, melanoma, meningioma, prostate, head and neck, bladder, pancreatic, and hepatocellular carcinoma, senolytic co-treatment consistently reduced tumor burden compared with senogenic alone. Senescence markers such as SA-β-gal, p21, p53 and p16INK4a were decreased in the majority of combination groups, confirming attenuation of senescence-associated cell-cycle arrest. IL-6 was the most consistently suppressed SASP cytokine. Ki-67 was decreased and Caspase-3 activation increased across most models, supporting reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. BCL2 downregulation and γ-H2AX elevation were observed in several studies, further suggesting increased apoptotic activity and DNA damage. CONCLUSION: Senolytic plus senogenic combinations demonstrate robust preclinical efficacy in reducing tumor growth and senescent burden while promoting apoptosis across diverse in vivo models. These findings highlight senotherapy as a promising adjunct to conventional senescence-inducing anticancer therapies and underscore the need for standardized in vivo methodologies and translational studies to guide clinical application. This review protocol was prospectively registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD420251161998).</description>

Alternatively, mandibular preservation and wrapping with a periosteal free flap may achieve healing in selected patients. Our objective was to assess the success rate and morbidity of revascularization of mandibular ORN using a humeral periosteal free flap. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed using medical records of patients who had undergone humeral periosteal free flap reconstruction for mandibular ORN. Clinical data, including age, gender, ORN site, ORN grade according to the Notani classification, clinical and radiological outcomes and complications were analyzed. The primary endpoint was ORN healing, defined as complete resolution of the main symptom (exposure, chronic infection, fistula, or fracture) at 6 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 36 lesions in 34 patients with mandibular ORN associated with bone exposure and/or infection and/or pathologic fracture were included. ORN healing at 6 months was achieved in 64.7% (n = 22/34) of treated sites in the overall cohort and in 91.6% (n = 22/24) of patients with a viable flap. CONCLUSION: The humeral periosteal free flap can be considered a reasonable surgical option for advanced mandibular ORN to avoid segmental mandibulectomy.</description>

This prospective pilot study aims to compare nasal mucosal sensitivity to air-jet stimuli between ENS patients and patients who underwent septoplasty/turbinate reduction (septo-turb) surgery, but without ENS symptoms. METHODS: Seven ENS and seven septo-turb subjects were recruited through a sample of convenience (from 06/2023 to 09/2024) due to the rarity of ENS. A precise, 0.25 s air jet ranging from 0.5 to 5 L/min was delivered via a 25-gage microcannula, with a 0.4 × 1.6 mm side opening placed 2 mm from the mucosal surface at predetermined sites that include the medial and lateral side of the nasal valve, the head and the center of inferior turbinate and their opposing septum. Detection thresholds were determined using a single-staircase method in 0.5 L/min steps. RESULTS: The ENS group had a significantly higher (less sensitive) threshold than the septo-turb group for the septum opposing the center of the inferior turbinate (ENS: 2.43 ± 1.37 L/min; septoplasty: 1.39 ± 1.27 L/min, p = 0.016); however, not for other sites. This regional threshold significantly correlated with all self-reported symptom scores (NOSE, SNOT-22, ENS6Q, VAS) (r = 0.45-0.54, all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Significant regional differences in air-jet stimulus sensitivity between ENS and septoplasty patients were found that significantly correlated with symptom scores. A future larger sample size would make a more definitive conclusion.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hu Y, Li X, Zhang L, Du L, Jin L, Zhou P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-026-26275-x'&gt;10.1186/s12889-026-26275-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41618277/'&gt;41618277&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Parental decision-making is pivotal to the uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among girls aged 9-14 years. However, the characteristics that distinguish parents who are willing versus unwilling to vaccinate-particularly those who are unwilling-remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to examine the underlying reasons and attributes associated with parental willingness and unwillingness, thereby providing evidence on the classification and heterogeneity of HPV vaccine hesitancy. METHODS: In May 2024, we conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey using convenience sampling among 1,331 parents of girls aged 9-14 years from seven schools in Shanghai, China. The survey collected sociodemographic characteristics, willingness to vaccinate daughters against HPV and the underlying reasons, and parental knowledge literacy regarding cervical cancer, HPV, HPV vaccination, and cervical cancer screening. Two-step cluster analysis was used to classify parents based on their stated reasons for willingness or unwillingness to vaccinate. We then examined associations between parental characteristics and cluster membership. RESULTS: Among 1,076 parents of unvaccinated girls aged 9-14 years, 18.12% reported unwillingness to vaccinate. Cluster analysis identified three distinct refusal clusters, labeled as the Moderate and Hesitant type (low knowledge literacy and limited understanding of HPV-related risks), the Trust-Critical type (high knowledge literacy but low institutional trust), and the Social-Norm Sensitive type (high educational attainment and susceptibility to peer and societal influences). Significant between-cluster differences were observed in educational attainment, number of children, and knowledge literacy, indicating that vaccine refusal is structurally diverse rather than uniform. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine refusal among Chinese parents is heterogeneous and appears to be shaped by cognitive, emotional, and social factors. Tailored interventions are therefore warranted. Segmented strategies that address cluster-specific drivers may reduce vaccine hesitancy more effectively than uniform public health messaging.</description>

Here, we report a tripartite enzyme complex from oral Streptococcus species-comprising 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase (HMGS), acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACAT), and a DUF35 protein-that catalyzes an unusual Friedel-Crafts C-acetylation on a pyrrolidine-2,4-dione scaffold, completing the biosynthesis of the antibiotic reutericyclin A. Cryo-electron microscopy of the S. macacae-derived thiolase complex (SmaATase) reveals a conserved architecture resembling the archaeal HMGS/ACAT/DUF35 complex involved in the mevalonate pathway, yet with key catalytic residues rewired to reprogram substrate specificity. Biochemical characterization, molecular modeling, and evolutionary analysis confirmed that the ancestral activity of HMG-CoA synthesis has been lost, while the complex has been repurposed to mediate Friedel-Crafts C-acylation of small molecule acceptors. These findings reveal a rare example of thiolase complex neofunctionalization, shedding light on an underexplored trajectory in enzyme evolution and offering a template for engineering C-C bond-forming catalysts in synthetic biology.</description>

To investigate how morphology influences nematode-associated microbiomes, we selected two widely distributed species: Acrobeles complexus, exhibiting elaborated oral structures, and Zeldia punctata, with simpler oral morphology. Unlike earlier studies that reported the microbiomes of A. complexus and Z. punctata independently, this study is the first to directly compare the two species. By integrating in silico re-analysis of our previously published microbiome datasets with new light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, we demonstrate how morphological adaptations, such as labial probolae and cuticle structures, shape associated bacterial communities. Our results revealed that A. complexus harbored a more diverse bacterial community than Z. punctata. Morphology showed that the complex oral structures of A. complexus facilitated selective bacterial capture, supporting greater microbial diversity compared to the simpler morphology of Z. punctata. Although statistical significance was not observed, the two species showed distinct patterns of microbial richness and diversity. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) revealed clearly separated bacterial community structures between the species. Linear discriminant analysis effect size identified potential microbial biomarkers at the genus level, including Firmicutes and Clostridium in A. complexus and Actinobacteria and Pseudomonas in Z. punctata. Predicted functional pathway analysis revealed notable differences in microbial metabolism, such as enrichment of bacterial secretion systems in A. complexus and amoebiasis and lipid metabolism pathways in Z. punctata. This study highlights the role of morphological adaptations in shaping microbiome composition in Cephalobidae nematodes and provides insights into the contribution of free-living bacterivorous nematodes to soil microbial balance. These findings lay the groundwork for further studies on nematode-mediated microbial interactions in soil ecosystems.</description>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of postoperative numbness, recovery of sensation, and anatomical predictors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Single tertiary center. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 160 patients who underwent endoscopic transseptal skull base surgery and categorized them as non-NSF (n = 75), NSF without floor extension (n = 7), and NSF with floor extension (n = 78). The primary outcome was patient-reported numbness of the front teeth or palate as assessed during hospitalization and at 3 months. The incisive canal, through which paired NPNs from the nasal cavities pass into the oral cavity, was classified on preoperative computed tomography (CT) as single (one channel receiving bilateral nerves), separated (two channels with bilateral separation), or intermediate (Y-shaped channel). RESULTS: Immediate numbness occurred in 5.3%, 14.3%, and 32.1% of those groups, respectively (P &lt; .001). At 3 months, persistent numbness was reported, respectively, in 1.3%, 0%, and 10.4%, with a significant difference between non-NSF and NSF with floor extension (P = .034). Immediate numbness occurred in 29.7% of those with a single canal and 11.3% of those with a separated canal (P = .021). CONCLUSION: NSF with floor extension increased the incidence of numbness and should be avoided when possible. Patients with a single canal on preoperative CT require careful surgical attention.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with LCG who underwent 24-h HEMII-pH monitoring. Reflux episodes were classified by acidity (acid, weakly acidic, weakly alkaline) and posture (upright, recumbent). Clinical characteristics, reflux episode profiles, lesion laterality, and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI) scores were compared between reflux-positive and reflux-negative patients. RESULTS: Among 41 patients, 25 (61.0%) were reflux-positive and 16 (39.0%) were reflux-negative, with no hypopharyngeal reflux event detected. The pH-based classification of reflux events identified a predominance of weakly acidic (46.2%) and weakly alkaline (44.3%) episodes; acidic events were uncommon (9.5%). Most reflux events occurred during upright periods (94.8%), with only 5.2% during recumbent position. Among unilateral lesions, a higher proportion of hypopharyngeal reflux-positive cases involved the left side (76.2% left, 23.8% right), while reflux-negative cases showed no lateral preference (60.0% left, 40.0% right). Symptom screening with the RSI had limited discrimination for hypopharyngeal reflux status (sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 46.7%, PPV 60.0%, NPV 36.8%). CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight the limitations of symptom-based diagnosis and empiric acid suppression in patients with LCG. Pre-treatment 24-h HEMII-pH monitoring can provide a more evidence-based initial approach than routine empiric therapy and supports individualized behavioral interventions.</description>

The intricate heterogeneity of neutrophils and their complex crosstalk within the TME remain poorly understood, thereby limiting the development of targeted therapeutic strategies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an unprecedented level of resolution for dissecting neutrophil subpopulations and elucidating their roles in CC pathogenesis. METHODS: We integrated scRNA-seq data from CC tissues (GSE208653, n = 5) with bulk RNA-seq cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas - Cervical Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Endocervical Adenocarcinoma (TCGA-CESC) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) database. Using Seurat-based clustering, pseudotime trajectory analysis and CellChat, we mapped neutrophil dynamics and intercellular communication networks. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using the limma package, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses. A prognostic model was subsequently constructed via LASSO-Cox regression. Key targets were further validated through both in vitro functional assays, immunohistochemical (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) analyses of human pathological specimens. RESULTS: Four functionally distinct neutrophil subtypes, including immature, mature, antitumor, and interferon-stimulated populations, were characterized in CC, demonstrating dynamic heterogeneity during tumorigenesis. Secreted Phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) was identified as a critical differentially expressed gene, with the SPP1-CD44 axis serving as a key mediator of neutrophil-tumor cell crosstalk. Downregulation of SPP1 markedly suppressed CC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. Furthermore, a prognostic signature based on risk stratification efficiently categorized patients into high- and low-risk cohorts, with validated clinical utility in predicting survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study comprehensively characterized the TME in CC through single-cell transcriptomics. Integrated analysis with bulk RNA-seq established and validated a robust prognostic signature, identifying SPP1 as a key oncogenic driver. The SPP1-centric model demonstrates significant clinical utility for risk stratification. These findings provide new insights into neutrophil heterogeneity and establish a mechanistic foundation for precision therapeutics in CC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 25-item questionnaire with three dimensions was developed. Using convenience sampling, 136 OLP patients from a tertiary hospital in Guangdong Province (December 2023-April 2024) completed the survey. Among them, 30 patients were retested 2-4 weeks after the initial survey, during which no participants received any OLP-related health education interventions. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's α coefficient, split-half reliability, and test-retest reliability, while validity was assessed via the content validity index, exploratory factor analysis, and confirmatory factor analysis. RESULTS: The questionnaire showed strong reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.923; test-retest reliability = 0.909) and validity (content validity index = 0.93). Factor analysis identified three dimensions, explaining 60.84% of the total variance, with adequate model fit indices. CONCLUSIONS: This validated 25-item questionnaire (covering knowledge, attitude, and practice dimensions) serves as an initial, reliable measure of OLP-related knowledge, attitudes, and self-management practices with acceptable construct validity in a single-center sample.</description>

METHODS: Quantitative synthesis without meta-analysis was conducted through an electronic search conducted on Ovid MEDLINE and Embase from 1946 to April 2024 with no restriction on study design. Primary outcome was postoperative bleeding in patients with platelet count &lt; 50,000/μL due to dental interventions. Two reviewers assessed independently, and a third resolved conflicts. This study was reported according to PRISMA 2020 and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024527279). RESULTS: 1633 unique articles were identified. Six case reports, four case series, nine cohort studies and one trial fulfilled the inclusion. Overall, 983 included cases consisted of 968 oral surgery, 10 periodontology and 5 dental anaesthesia cases. Postoperative bleeding occurred in 65 cases following oral surgery procedures, of which 1 was life-threatening. Bleeding rates for cases with platelet levels &lt; 50,000/μL were 12.9%, and 4.9% for ≥ 50,000/μL. Risk ratio was 2.95 (95% CI: 1.76-4.96; p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that platelet counts &lt; 50,000/μL is a contraindication for dental interventions, although findings suggest higher postoperative bleeding rates, particularly in oral surgery. Patients should be assessed individually, with more controlled trials required.</description>

Disruptions in NCC development can result in congenital disorders (neurocristopathies). Yet, our understanding of the cellular mechanisms and signals that govern mammalian NCC formation remains poor. Here, we discovered nuclear receptor superfamily 6 group member 1 (NR6A1/GCNF/RTR) is a novel, critical regulator of mammalian NCC specification, formation and survival. Nr6a1 expression in mouse embryos spatiotemporally overlaps with early NCC development. NR6A1 loss-of-function perturbs anterior cranial NCC formation and survival, with complete agenesis of migratory NCC caudal to the first pharyngeal arch. Using targeted molecular and genomic approaches, we demonstrate that these phenotypes are associated with perturbation of NCC specification and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and with persistent expression of pluripotency-associated factors. Supporting these observations, in vivo overexpression of Oct4 in gastrulating mouse embryos disrupts NCC specification and formation. Conditional temporal deletion revealed that Nr6a1 is required during mid-late gastrulation, demonstrating that the initiation of murine NCC specification likely occurs during gastrulation - earlier than previously thought, but in close alignment with the established timeline of NCC development in other vertebrate model organisms. These findings also reveal that the gold standard transgenic mouse line, Wnt1-Cre, is unsuitable for studying genetic function during NCC specification and formation. In summary, NR6A1 is essential for mammalian NCC development and may function during gastrulation as a bimodal switch modulating pluripotency-associated factors in the neuroepithelium, while concomitantly activating NCC specifiers and regulators of EMT.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 205 hospitalized children diagnosed with MPP at the Third Ward of the department of paediatrics, Jingzhou Central Hospital, from October 2023 to October 2024. Diagnosis was confirmed by pharyngeal MP nucleic acid testing and MP antibody titers (MP-Ab ≥ 1:160). All patients were screened for macrolide-resistant gene mutations (A2063G/A2064G). Patients were categorized based on the presence of macrolide-resistant gene mutations and RMPP diagnosis. Clinical features, laboratory results, and treatments were compared between groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors for RMPP. RESULTS: Among 205 children with MPP, 157 (76.6%) harbored A2063G/A2064G mutations. Of the 77 children with RMPP, 71 (92.2%) carried these mutations, showing a significant association (P &lt; 0.05). Compared to the non-resistant group, children with resistant mutations had prolonged fever duration, delayed defervescence after azithromycin, and required more bronchoscopic alveolar lavage (P &lt; 0.05). The RMPP group exhibited more severe symptoms, longer fever and hospital stays, higher inflammatory markers (CRP, LDH, D-dimer, ESR, PCT; P &lt; 0.001), and more frequent pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion, plastic bronchitis, and extrapulmonary involvement. Multivariate analysis identified macrolide-resistant mutations, fever duration, and D-dimer level as independent risk factors for RMPP. CONCLUSION: The widespread macrolide resistance in M. pneumoniae (76.6% in this cohort) was associated with point mutations at the A2063G and/or A2064G loci in the 23S rRNA gene. The development of RMPP is linked to macrolide-resistant mutations, duration of fever and D-dimer levels. D-dimer emerged as the most predictive risk factor.</description>

Volume overload represents a critical factor in effectively controlling hypertension. Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA) has been validated as an accurate method for assessing volume status. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of BIA-derived volume indicators for hypertension and circadian BP rhythm abnormalities in MHD patients, providing a theoretical basis for optimizing volume control and BP management. METHODS: We used body composition monitor to assess pre-dialysis volume status and employed 44-hour interdialytic ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) to obtain BP parameters. Comparative analyses were conducted between controlled vs. uncontrolled ABPM groups, and normal vs. abnormal circadian BP rhythm groups. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify correlations and independent predictors, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves determining optimal predictive cut-off values. RESULTS: Patients in the uncontrolled ABPM group exhibited higher levels of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), post-dialysis serum creatinine (Post-HD Scr), post-dialysis urea nitrogen (Post-HD BUN), overhydration (OH), extracellular water (ECW), body surface area-adjusted ECW (ECW/BSA), ECW to total body water ratio (ECW/TBW) and ECW to intracellular water ratio (ECW/ICW), but lower Kt/V and URR. The abnormal circadian BP rhythm group showed higher iPTH, OH, ECW, ECW/BSA and ECW/ICW. Significant correlations were observed: 44h SBP correlated positively with iPTH, OH, ECW/TBW, ECW/ICW, and negatively with Kt/V, URR; 44h DBP correlated positively with iPTH and OH; nocturnal systolic BP decline rate (NSDP) showed negative correlations with iPTH, OH. Multivariate logistic analysis identified OH &gt; 2.35L, ECW/ICW &gt; 0.945 and iPTH &gt; 240.6 pg/ml as independent predictors for hypertension, while OH &gt; 1.55L and iPTH &gt; 203.75 pg/mL predicted abnormal circadian BP rhythm (all p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: BIA-derived indicators of volume overload, particularly OH and ECW/ICW, can guide ABPM management in MHD patients and improve long-term outcomes.</description>

The impact of soft diets, which reduce masticatory load, on myokine signaling remains unclear. Accordingly, we examined whether reduced mastication alters myokine secretion from the masseter muscle and affects muscle development and systemic metabolic regulation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either hard or soft diets for short-term (1 week) or long-term (7 weeks). Body weight, masseter muscle weight, epididymal fat weight, and fiber cross-sectional area were assessed. The expression of key myokines (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α, Nfkb1, and myostatin [Mstn]) was measured using qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction), and myostatin protein levels were evaluated using immunohistochemical assays. Short-term soft diet feeding did not produce any major morphological changes. However, long-term feeding significantly reduced masseter weight and fiber size, while increasing the amount of epididymal fat, despite an unchanged total body weight. At the molecular level, IL-6 expression was consistently lower in soft diet-fed mice, and IL-10 levels declined further with long-term feeding. In contrast, TNF-α, Nfkb1, and Mstn levels were elevated at both ages. The immunohistochemical assays confirmed increased myostatin protein levels in the masseter under soft-diet conditions. These results suggest that reduced masticatory stimulation remodels the biochemical environment of the masseter muscle, suppressing anabolic and anti-inflammatory signals while enhancing catabolic pathways. These alterations impair muscle growth and promote fat accumulation indicating that masticatory load regulates craniofacial muscle development and systemic metabolism through myokine-mediated mechanisms. Therefore, maintaining adequate mastication during growth may be critical for oral health, body composition, and long-term metabolic homeostasis.</description>

Though case reports document frontal sinus complications years after surgery, no studies to date examine the presence of delayed frontal sinus disease on long-term imaging after FFC. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary care center. METHODS: Adult patients who underwent FFC with type III forehead classification between August 2016 to December 2019 were offered postoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. Preoperative and postoperative CTs were compared using the Lund-Mackay (LM) scoring system and assessed for frontal sinus disease. Retrospective chart review for demographic data and new diagnoses of sinusitis were extracted. RESULTS: A total of 40 transfeminine patients were included. The average time from surgery to postoperative CT scan was 71 months (median: 67.5 months; range: 56-96 months). The mean preoperative and postoperative total LM scores were 0.98 and 1.05 (P = .83), respectively. The mean frontal sinus-specific preoperative and postoperative LM scores were 0.2 and 0.15 (P = .64), respectively. Though 5 (12.5%) patients exhibited trace frontal sinus mucosal thickening on postoperative CT scans, significant frontal sinus pathology (eg, mucoceles, osteomyelitis, sinocutaneous fistula) was not found in any patient, and none required surgical treatment for sinus-related disease. CONCLUSION: FFC is a relatively safe procedure with low risk for frontal sinus-related complications within the first 6 years after surgery. Continued surveillance should be considered to detect serious frontal sinus pathology that may develop beyond this timeframe.</description>

Effective treatment is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a phase 3, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, controlled trial involving adults with acute, nonarteritic central retinal artery occlusion who had symptom onset within 4.5 hours before treatment. Patients were assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive intravenous tenecteplase (at a dose of 0.25 mg per kilogram of body weight) and oral placebo or intravenous placebo and oral aspirin (at a dose of 300 mg). The primary end point was vision recovery, defined as a best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the affected eye at 30 days of up to 0.7 logMAR (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution; equivalent to ≥20/100). Key secondary visual end points were a BCVA of up to 0.5 logMAR (equivalent to ≥20/63), mean improvement in BCVA, and perimetry score at 30 days. Key safety end points included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and death. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients at 16 sites in six countries underwent randomization, with 40 assigned to receive tenecteplase and 38 to receive aspirin. At 30 days, 8 patients (20%) in the tenecteplase group and 9 patients (24%) in the aspirin group had vision recovery (risk difference, -3.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, -22.0 to 14.7; P = 0.69). The outcomes with regard to the secondary visual end points did not differ substantially between the groups. There was a greater incidence of adverse events in the tenecteplase group, including one fatal intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous tenecteplase administered within 4.5 hours after onset of central retinal artery occlusion did not result in significantly greater vision recovery at 30 days than oral aspirin but was associated with serious safety concerns.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: TACTIC CRC-02 was a single-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II trial. Eligible patients had previously untreated, unresectable MSS/pMMR, RAS-mutant mCRC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. Patients received intravenous tislelizumab (200 mg/m2), bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), and oxaliplatin (130 mg/m2) on day 1, with oral capecitabine (1000 mg/m2 twice daily) on days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle, for up to eight induction cycles followed by maintenance therapy. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS: Between March 2023 and March 2024, 52 patients were enrolled and treated. At a median follow-up of 17.8 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 15.8 months-not reached), the primary endpoint was met with an ORR of 73.1% (95% CI 61.1% to 85.1%). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95% CI 9.1-11.6 months), and the median overall survival was not mature. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 21.2% of patients, with grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events occurring in 1.9%. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: First-line treatment with tislelizumab plus XELOX and bevacizumab demonstrated a high ORR and a manageable safety profile in patients with MSS/pMMR, RAS-mutant mCRC. This chemo-immunotherapy combination represents a promising strategy and warrants further investigation in a phase III trial.</description>

In 2022, HPV16/18 genotyping was added for women with borderline/low-grade cytology. Triage with HPV genotyping may better balance screening benefits, harms, and costs. Therefore, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of 19 triage strategies based on net monetary benefit (NMB) at cost-effectiveness thresholds of €20,000 and €50,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), with the highest NMB indicating the most cost-effective strategy. Triage tests included 16/18 genotyping, 7-type (16/18/31/33/45/52/58) genotyping, and cytology (high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [HSIL]: moderate/severe, atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance [ASC-US]/low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions [LSIL]: borderline/low-grade, negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy [NILM]: normal). Effects on cancer incidence and mortality were obtained by combining POBASCAM trial data with nationwide screening and cancer registries. Time since the onset of high-grade lesion (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [grade 2/3] [CIN2/3]) at baseline of the Population-based Screening Study Amsterdam trial cannot be estimated from the data and was varied between 0 and 10 years. At a €20,000/QALY threshold, immediate referral for HSIL and 16/18-positive ASC-US/LSIL, and repeat cytology for 16/18-negative ASC-US/LSIL and 7-types positive NILM had the highest NMB (€214.1 to €309.3/woman gained compared to referring all HPV-positive women). At a €50,000/QALY threshold, immediate referral for all 16/18-positives and/or HSIL, and repeat cytology for 16/18-negative ASC-US/LSIL and 7-types positive NILM had the highest NMB if time since onset of CIN2/3 was greater than 2 years. Cytology combined with HPV16/18 and extended genotyping is cost-effective for triage of HPV-positives. Immediate colposcopy referral of all HPV16/18-positives is cost-effective at a €50,000/QALY threshold.</description>

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may overcome resistance to anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The clinical activity and safety of FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC or anti-PD-1 plus anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) therapy in melanoma have not been evaluated. Here we report results from FMT-LUMINate, a multicenter, open-label, phase 2 trial assessing healthy donor FMT plus anti-PD-1 in NSCLC (n = 20) or anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4 (dual ICI) in melanoma (n = 20), in the first-line setting. Eligible patients received a single FMT via oral capsules prior to ICI initiation. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) in NSCLC. Secondary endpoints included ORR in melanoma, safety and donor-host microbiome similarity. In NSCLC, the ORR was 80% (16/20), meeting the study primary endpoint. In melanoma, the ORR was 75% (15/20). FMT was deemed safe in both cohorts by an independent data and safety monitoring committee, with no grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) in NSCLC and 13 (65%) patients experiencing grade 3 or higher AEs in melanoma. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing revealed that responders developed a distinct post-FMT gut microbiome composition, independent of acquired donor-recipient similarity or strain-level engraftment. Responders exhibited significantly greater loss of baseline bacterial species compared to non-responders, with frequent depletion of Enterocloster citroniae, E. lavalensis and Clostridium innocuum. This finding was reproduced across three published FMT oncology trials. We recolonized antibiotic-treated, tumor-bearing mice with post-FMT stool from two responder patients, and reintroduction of the specific bacterial species that were lost after FMT abrogated the antitumor effect of ICI. Taken together, these findings confirm the clinical activity of FMT in combination with ICI and suggest that the elimination of deleterious taxa is required for FMT-mediated therapeutic benefit.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wu ZH, Chu ZX, Meng YL, Jiang YJ, Shang H, Hu QH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68970-8'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-68970-8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41605946/'&gt;41605946&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite proven oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) efficacy, adherence barriers among men who have sex with men (MSM) persist. Economic viability of digital adherence tools in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires validation. We assessed the 6-month within-trial cost-effectiveness of a digital intervention for real-time enhancement of oral PrEP adherence (DIRECT-PrEP) in China, from health system, multipayer, and societal perspectives. Costs were derived from hospital records, and effectiveness was evaluated using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and PrEP-adherence days (PADs). Among 442 participants (247 intervention, 195 standard care), incremental costs per QALY gained for the smart pillbox intervention were $19,575.93 (health system), $19,656.66 (multipayer), and $19,844.42 (societal)-all below the cost-effectiveness threshold of three times per capita gross domestic product ($31,200). Costs per PAD gained were $30.46-$30.86, achieving &gt;95% probability of cost-effectiveness at willingness-to-pay thresholds of $47.50-$48.50 per PAD. Notably, the intervention demonstrated greater cost-effectiveness per QALY among participants stratified as more socially vulnerable ($16,259.77-$16,490.41) compared with those classified as less socially vulnerable ($23,514.83-$23,834.38). These results establish the smart-pillbox digital intervention as a cost-effective strategy for oral PrEP adherence within primary healthcare settings in LMICs, particularly when prioritizing more socially vulnerable populations, though long-term scalability requires further validation.</description>

We hypothesized that ultra-low-dose nivolumab would retain clinical efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this phase III randomized superiority trial, patients with advanced solid tumors (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1) and progression on ≥1 prior line of systemic therapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to ultra-low-dose nivolumab (20 mg intravenously once every 2 weeks) or standard chemotherapy (docetaxel or paclitaxel, as per tumor type). Treatment continued until progression or intolerable toxicity. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). RESULTS: From June 2020 to February 2024, we enrolled 500 patients: 250 per arm; 52% had head and neck and 36% lung cancers. The median number of prior lines of therapy was 1 (range, 1-8); 29% had received ≥2 prior lines. Median OS was significantly longer with ultra-low-dose nivolumab: 5.88 months (95% CI, 4.99 to 7.13) versus 4.70 months (95% CI, 3.91 to 5.65; hazard ratio [HR], 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.97]; P = .022). One-year OS was 27.3% versus 16.9%. Median progression-free survival was similar: 2.04 months (95% CI, 2.00 to 2.10) with ultra-low-dose nivolumab and 2.09 months (95% CI, 2.04 to 2.17) with chemotherapy (HR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.23]; P = .77). Grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events were less frequent with ultra-low-dose nivolumab (42.5% v 60.8%; P &lt; .001). Quality of life (QoL) was significantly better with ultra-low-dose nivolumab. CONCLUSION: Ultra-low-dose nivolumab significantly improves OS versus chemotherapy in pretreated solid tumors, with fewer severe toxicities and better QoL. These findings support re-evaluation of ICI dosing strategies and may enhance global access.</description>

While the causes of cancer are complex and varied, certain risk factors - such as exposure to environmental pollutants and specific lifestyle choices - are modifiable and can be addressed. A case-control study was conducted in Bangladesh from 25 August 2023 to 18 April 2024 to examine the association between cancer risk and a range of lifestyle and environmental factors. The study specifically focused on six common cancer types: breast, hematological, oral, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer. This study identified several lifestyle and environmental factors positively associated with cancer risk. Individuals using wood or kerosene for cooking had higher odds of cancer compared to those using supplied gas (AOR = 3.886). Consumption of overcooked or poorly cooked food was associated with an increased risk of cancer compared to the consumption of well-cooked food (AOR = 2.478). Oral hygiene also showed a relationship, with participants brushing their teeth only 2-3 times a week having a higher chance of cancer compared to those who brush regularly (AOR = 3.103). In addition, frequent exposure to mosquito repellent was positively associated with cancer risk (AOR = 1.569), and exposure to inorganic dust showed a similar association (AOR = 1.673). These findings highlight modifiable lifestyle and environmental factors that could inform future cancer prevention strategies in Bangladesh.</description>

This exploratory study assessed the safety and efficacy of a novel once-daily oral selective TRPC6 inhibitor, BI 764198. METHODS: This multicentre phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised controlled trial assessed BI 764198 (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg once daily) versus placebo over 12 weeks in participants aged 18-75 years with biopsy-confirmed primary FSGS (based on the absence of clinical evidence of secondary cause) or with a disease-causing TRPC6 variant. The study took place in 31 sites in ten countries, and random allocation was performed centrally in blocks in a 1:1:1:1 ratio and was stratified according to use of corticosteroids. Participants were receiving stable conservative and immunosuppressive therapy, with screening urine protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) at 1·0 g/g or greater and estimated glomerular filtration rate at 30 mL/min per 1·73 m2 or greater. The primary endpoint was the proportion of participants with proteinuria response (≥25% UPCR reduction from baseline) at week 12. Other key outcomes were safety and tolerability. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov on Jan 27, 2022 (NCT05213624) and is complete as of Jan 3, 2025. FINDINGS: From March 10, 2022, to Sept 3, 2024, 139 participants were screened and 67 were randomly assigned to receive placebo or BI 764198 at doses of 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg (five participants were randomly assigned in error and were not treated). 62 participants received treatment, two of whom had missing baseline or post-baseline UPCR measurements and were not included in the full analysis set. Overall, 37 participants (60%) were male and 25 participants (40%) were female; the mean age was 40·7 years (SD 12·6); and the majority of the trial cohort were White (39 [63%] of 62). Proteinuria responses were observed in eight (44%) of 18, two (14%) of 14, and six (43%) of 14 participants receiving BI 764198 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg, respectively (16 [35%] of 46 for all BI 764198 doses) versus one (7%) of 14 receiving placebo; corresponding odds ratios (ORs) versus placebo were OR 10·0 (95% CI 1·6-118·1), 1·5 (0·2-19·5), and 6·0 (0·9-73·6) for the three doses of BI 764198, and 4·9 (1·0-48·8) for all doses combined. BI 764198 was well tolerated with no meaningful differences in adverse event frequencies across treatment arms; treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 44 (71%) of 62 participants, with similar frequencies of adverse events observed in the placebo group (ten [71%] of 14) and BI 764198 groups (34 [71%] of 48). INTERPRETATION: BI 764198 lowered proteinuria and was well tolerated by participants in this trial. This is the first evidence of efficacy with a podocyte-targeted therapy in FSGS. Larger randomised controlled trials over longer treatment durations, enabling meaningful subgroup analyses, are planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of BI 764198 treatment in FSGS and other conditions affected by podocytopathy.

Here, we report the clinical efficacy and safety profile of lazertinib plus stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in treatment-naive, EGFR-mutant oligometastatic NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ABLATE is a phase II, multicenter, randomized, non-comparative study that included patients harboring activating EGFR mutations (ex19del or L858R) with synchronous oligometastatic disease (metastatic lesion ≤5). Patients received oral lazertinib 240 mg as monotherapy or in combination with SBRT, which was given immediately or 8 weeks after initiation of lazertinib. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS of lazertinib plus SBRT. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients were enrolled in the study (n = 34, lazertinib; n = 33, lazertinib plus SBRT). At a median follow-up duration of 23.1 months (range 7.1-34.1 months), the median PFS was 34.0 months [90% confidence interval (CI) 19.2 months-not reached (NR)] and objective response rate (ORR) was 58% (95% CI 40.7% to 74.4%) for the lazertinib plus SBRT group. In lazertinib monotherapy, the median duration of follow-up was 22.4 months (range 3.7-33.5 months), the median PFS was 24.8 months (90% CI 15.7 months-NR), and ORR was 68% (95% CI 51.9% to 83.4%). SBRT led to local treatment effect with 92% (n = 12/14) progressing to new sites at progression. No new safety signals were seen with the addition of SBRT, and no grade ≥3 radiation pneumonitis was seen. Whole-exome sequencing of baseline tumor samples revealed that TP53 (64%), CRLF2 (43%), and P2RY9 (43%) were the most common mutations in patients treated with lazertinib plus SBRT. CONCLUSION: In treatment-naive, EGFR-mutant oligometastatic NSCLC, adding upfront SBRT to lazertinib is a viable therapeutic option with a manageable safety profile.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This first-in-human, phase I trial evaluated patients with BRAF V600-mutated advanced solid tumors, including brain metastases (≤3 cm) and primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Patients received ABM-1310 monotherapy [25-250 mg twice a day (b.i.d.); Parts A/C] or in combination (ABM-1310 : 100-200 mg b.i.d.; cobimetinib 60 mg once a day, days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle; Part B). Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD); secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetic (PK) profile and antitumor activity per RECIST v1.1 or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were enrolled (36 monotherapy, 17 combination). Median age was 55 years; 68% were male, 72% had ≥3 prior treatment lines, 92.5% had BRAF V600E mutations, 75% of patients had received prior BRAF plus MEK inhibitor therapy, and 7.5% had BRAF inhibitor monotherapy. Common tumor types included melanoma (47%), glioblastoma (17%) and thyroid cancer (13%). The most frequent treatment-related adverse events were QT prolongation and rash. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred in 6/37 patients (16.2%), all at doses ≥150 mg. All DLTs involved asymptomatic electrocardiogram QT prolonged, with two cases presenting co-occurring toxicities: one with rash and one with renal failure-establishing the MTD at 200 mg b.i.d. Among 50 efficacy-evaluable patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 12% and disease control rate (DCR) was 64%. Median progression-free survival was 4.96 months (2.07-8.31) and median overall survival was 24.48 months 11.6-not estimable. In patients with primary CNS tumors (n = 13), ORR was 23.1% and DCR 76.9%. PK analyses showed dose-proportional exposure and moderate accumulation. CONCLUSIONS: ABM-1310 showed a favorable safety profile and encouraging intracranial activity. These findings support continued evaluation for CNS tumors and in cancer patients with prior BRAF inhibitor exposure.</description>

A previous study identified a population of cells in the proventriculus which incorporate bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), a marker of DNA synthesis, and proposed that these cycling cells are multipotent stem cells that replace dying cells elsewhere in the tissue. Here, we re-investigate these cycling cells and find that they do not undergo mitosis, do not generate clonal lineages, and do not proliferate in response to tissue damage, and are therefore not stem cells. Instead, we find that these cells continually endocycle throughout the fly's life, increasing their ploidy and size, while at the same time cells in this tissue are lost into the gut lumen as the fly ages. Functionally, these cells play a critical role in the synthesis of peritrophic membrane components, and we show that when their endocycling is experimentally increased or decreased, there is a concomitant change in ploidy, tissue size, and peritrophic membrane synthesis. Further, we show that inhibition of endocycling makes flies more susceptible to orally infectious bacteria. Altogether, we show that continual endocycling of these cells is critical for maintaining tissue size and function in the face of cell loss due to aging or tissue damage.</description>

Implant placement techniques-freehand, pilot-drilled, and fully guided-differ in accuracy, surgical time, and outcomes. In this study, only one predefined index implant per patient was analyzed to avoid confounding from multi-implant cases, and template fabrication for the pilot-drilled group was performed using diagnostic wax-up and thermoplastic material. This study evaluated these techniques in partially edentulous patients. METHODS: Ninety patients were randomly assigned to three groups: freehand (n = 30), pilot- drilled (n = 30), and fully guided (n = 30). Surgery duration, implant placement accuracy, post- operative complications, early implant failure rates, and patient satisfaction were measured. Accuracy was assessed using standardized CBCT imaging at 12 months, and satisfaction was evaluated via a validated questionnaire six months after prosthetic loading. RESULTS: The fully guided technique demonstrated superior accuracy (p &lt; 0.001), shorter surgical times (45 minutes vs. 60 and 75 minutes, p &lt; 0.01), fewer complications (5% vs. 15% and 20%, p &lt; 0.05), and higher satisfaction (9.2/10, p &lt; 0.01). Early implant failure, defined at the implant level, occurred in 4/30 implants (13.3%) in the freehand group, 0/30 in the pilot-drilled group, and 2/30 in the fully guided group (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Fully guided implant surgery outperformed other techniques in accuracy, efficiency, and patient satisfaction. These findings support fully guided, prosthetically driven workflows as a preferred option for partially edentulous patients, particularly in cases requiring high precision.</description>

Our study aimed to identify additional factors associated with hypoglycaemia in children with acute vomiting and dehydration. METHODS: Our retrospective single-centre study included 560 healthy children and adolescents (aged 29 days to 17.96 years) without known metabolic disorders admitted to hospital with dehydration due to acute illness with vomiting or poor oral intake. Historical and anthropometric parameters were evaluated as potential factors associated with hypoglycaemia. RESULTS: A total of 171 (30.5%) participants (aged 0.6-10.7, median 3.8 years) experienced hypoglycaemia (≤3.3 mmol/l). Besides known factors such as a higher degree of dehydration (OR 2.505, 95% CI 1.532-4.095) and complete absence of oral intake (OR 2.185, 95% CI 1.331-3.586), additional factors independently associated with hypoglycaemia included diarrhoea (OR 0.178, 95% CI 0.068-0.468) and lower body mass index (BMI) (OR 0.011, 95% CI 0.000-0.605). Children with hypoglycaemia had a significantly lower BMI (median 14.29 vs 15.46 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001) than children without hypoglycaemia. Only one child with hypoglycaemia was obese. The highest rate of hypoglycaemia (37.5-51.6%) was observed in the 2-7-year age groups, who also had the lowest median BMI values (13.9-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: Low BMI and absence of diarrhoea were associated with increased odds of hypoglycaemia. The typical BMI curve for children with physiologically low values at 2-7 years of age may partially explain the high incidence of hypoglycaemia in otherwise healthy children with decreased oral intake at this age.</description>

Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 3869 advanced CC patients from South Korea's cancer registry (2012-2019), alongside claims and death records (2012-2021). Among these 2792 patients diagnosed after bevacizumab's NHI inclusion (August 2015), survival outcomes were compared between those receiving bevacizumab with platinum-based chemotherapy (n = 1787, 64.0%) versus chemotherapy alone (n = 1005, 36.0%). Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Results: Following NHI coverage of bevacizumab, median OS increased from 1.5 to 2.5 years, and the 5-year OS rate increased from 25.6% to 41.4% (weighted hazard ratio [wHR], 0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.67). Among patients receiving bevacizumab, median OS was 2.6 years compared to 2.2 years for those not receiving bevacizumab, with 5-year OS rates of 42.0% and 40.2%, respectively (wHR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.90). Subgroup analyses revealed that bevacizumab was associated with significantly better OS in patients with prior concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) history (wHR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.61-0.75), regardless of histologic subtype (squamous cell carcinoma [SCC]: wHR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.78] vs. non-SCC: wHR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.55-0.79]). Conclusions: The national investment in the implementation of bevacizumab was associated with favorable survival outcomes in advanced CC patients. Particularly, bevacizumab showed pronounced survival benefit for patients with prior CCRT history, regardless of histologic subtype.</description>

Targeting epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) alterations with overall response rates of more than 80% has provided a paradigm shift in the treatment of NSCLC; however, NSCLC patients harbouring uncommon mutations and exon 20 insertions still have a dismal prognosis underscoring the urgent need to develop novel EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with proven activity against these EGFR alterations. Zipalertinib is a newly developed oral, irreversible compound which is characterized by its unique pyrrolopyrimidine structure which discriminates this novel TKI from others. It is active against the classical mutations (i.e., del19, L858R) and some of the uncommon mutations (e.g., T790M, G719X, S768I, L861Q, but not C797S) and is predominantly active in NSCLC cells harbouring exon20ins. Zipalertinib is currently being extensively evaluated in several clinical NSCLC trials (REZILIENT 1-4) and has shown significant clinical activity in NSCLC patients with uncommon mutations, exon20ins, and in brain metastases (REZILIENT 3 trial). Moreover, zipalertinib in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy followed by zipalertinib monotherapy as first-line therapy is currently being evaluated in the pivotal, ongoing REZILIENT 3 randomized trial. In addition, the efficacy of zipalertinib is also studied in the adjuvant setting (REZILIENT 4 trial, stage IB-IIIA NSCLCs with exon20ins and uncommon mutations). The role and the integration of therapies targeting exon20ins or uncommon mutations into the first- and second-line treatment armamentarium for NSCLC patients is not yet fully established, and the therapeutic impact of monotherapies (e.g., sunvozertinib, firmonertinib) versus combinations with standard platinum-based chemotherapy (e.g., zipalertinib, amivantamab) currently still lacks robust evidence to further change the therapeutic landscape for these patients. Therefore, results from the ongoing trials are eagerly awaited and are expected to shed some light on these open questions.</description>

Methods: A total of 182 patients diagnosed with GEA at our center during the period 2014-2025 were included in this study. Nineteen GEA cases, 6 HPV-independent non-GEA cases, 59 HPV-associated usual endocervical adenocarcinoma cases, and 66 squamous cell carcinoma cases from online database were also included. Results: Vaginal bleeding (39.56%) and watery discharge (35.16%) were the most common symptoms. As many as 21.43% of patients had no specific complaints, and 80% of GEA showed no distinct mass through gynecological examination. A total of 64% of GEA were stage IIB-IV at diagnosis, with a 5-year survival of 41% versus 85% for stage I-IIA (p &lt; 0.05). The rate of lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), lymph node metastasis, and ovarian metastasis were 49.64%, 42.00%, and 29.29%, respectively. The 5-year survival and recurrence rates after primary therapy were 57% and 23%, respectively. For GEA treatment, surgery might be associated with improved overall survival for the population at stage III-IV. Survival analysis identified deep infiltration depth (≥2/3), a maximum diameter of the tumor (MDOT) of ≥3 cm, and ovary metastasis as potential indicators of worse OS and PFS for whole patients. Additionally, ovary metastasis indicated poor PFS and OS for stage I-II. Genomic information TP53 mutation, PTEN deletion and STK11 mutation might be the most prevalent genomic alterations. Conclusions: These findings indicated GEA as an aggressive cervical cancer, with high rate of lymph node metastasis, high recurrence rate and short 5-year survival. Ovary metastasis reflected advanced disease burden and surgery might be associated with improved survival in advanced stage. For genomic information, GEA showed genetic heterogeneity and a low level of genomic instability.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Selznick H, Lee KC, Hershberger M, Panchal N, Brandfon B, Ford BP&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.006'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2026.01.006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41628897/'&gt;41628897&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is a biologic complication of implant therapy that compromises long-term function and esthetics. With obesity rising globally, determining whether body mass index (BMI) independently contributes to peri-implantitis is critical for identifying at-risk patients and improving implant success. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between BMI and peri-implantitis. STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of implants placed at the Philadelphia Veterans Authority Medical Center between 2006 and 2019. Patients were included in the study if they had complete medical and dental records and a BMI recorded within 3 months of placement. Patients with systemic confounders such as bisphosphonate therapy, head and neck radiation, or incomplete data were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The primary predictor variable was BMI, which was utilized as a binary variable as either nonobese (&lt;30 kg/m2) or obese (≥30 kg/m2). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome was time from implant placement to peri-implantitis, defined as radiographic evidence of crestal bone loss with clinical bleeding on probing, with or without suppuration. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, sex, diabetes status, smoking history, alcohol use, implant location, and prior bone grafting. ANALYSES: Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed for each predictor, and time-to-event curves were compared with log-rank tests to identify significant predictors of peri-implantitis. Multivariate analysis of significant predictors was performed using Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted hazard ratios. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Our database included 325 subjects who received 1,138 implants. Utilizing a subject-level analysis, 325 implants (28.6%) composed the final study sample after randomly selecting 1 implant per subject. The mean subject age was 59.3 ± 10.6 years, and 310 (95.4%) of subjects were male. Peri-implantitis occurred in 80 implants (24.6%). The 5-year peri-implantitis rates were 22.7 and 34.0% for subjects with BMI&lt;30 kg/m2 and BMI≥30 kg/m2, respectively (P = .04). In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 remained independently associated with an increased risk of peri-implantitis (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.44; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Elevated BMI is an independent predictor of peri-implantitis. These findings emphasize the need for integrating BMI and metabolic screening into implant planning and maintenance. Recognition of obesity-related inflammatory mechanisms may improve preventive strategies and long-term implant outcomes in clinical practice.</description>

Historically, induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, as established by the CROSS trial, became the standard of care for locally advanced disease due to improvements in R0 resection rates and overall survival. More recently, the ESOPEC trial reexamined this paradigm in esophageal adenocarcinoma, demonstrating superior survival and improved systemic disease control with perioperative chemotherapy using the FLOT regimen compared with chemoradiotherapy. In parallel, the MATTERHORN trial further advanced perioperative treatment by showing improved event-free survival with the addition of the immune checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab to FLOT chemotherapy. Alongside these systemic therapy advances, surgical management has transitioned toward minimally invasive and robotic-assisted esophagectomy, offering equivalent oncologic outcomes with reduced perioperative morbidity. This review summarizes the evolving evidence from pivotal clinical trials, highlights ongoing studies integrating immunotherapy, and discusses emerging strategies such as adoptive cell transfer which currently is under investigation for metastatic recurrence, but in the future may provide additional treatment options for resectable esophageal cancer.</description>

Accurate, the non-invasive prediction of tumor behavior is essential to guide personalized management and avoid overtreatment or delayed intervention. Objective: To systematically review and synthesize the evidence on MRI-based biomarkers for predicting VS growth and treatment responses. Methods: We conducted a PRISMA-compliant search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases for studies published between 1 January 2000 and 1 January 2025, addressing MRI predictors of VS growth. Cohort studies evaluating texture features, signal intensity ratios, perfusion parameters, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) metrics were included. Study quality was assessed using the NOS (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale) score, GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation), and ROBIS (Risk of Bias in Systematic reviews) tool. Data on diagnostic performance, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and p value, were extracted and descriptively analyzed. Results: Ten cohort studies (five retrospective, five prospective, total n = 525 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Texture analysis metrics, such as kurtosis and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features, yielded AUCs of 0.65-0.99 for predicting volumetric or linear growth thresholds. Signal intensity ratios on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images for tumor/temporalis muscle achieved a 100% sensitivity and 93.75% specificity. Perfusion MRI parameters (Ktrans, ve, ASL, and DSC derived blood-flow metrics) differentiated growing from stable tumors with AUCs up to 0.85. ADC changes post-gamma knife surgery predicted a favorable response, though the baseline ADC had limited value for natural growth prediction. The heterogeneity in growth definitions, MRI protocols, and retrospective designs remains a key limitation. Conclusions: MRI-based biomarkers may provide exploratory signals associated with VS growth and treatment responses. However, substantial heterogeneity in growth definitions and MRI protocols, small single-center cohorts, and the absence of external validation currently limit clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vedachalam S, Freihat M, Alomari AK, Sears CR, Al Nasrallah N&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1733651'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1733651&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41626164/'&gt;41626164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Organizing pneumonia (OP) is often considered a benign finding, but in some cases, it may be associated with underlying malignancy. With the increasing use of minimally invasive biopsy techniques, understanding the relationship between OP and lung cancer is critical to avoid delayed or missed diagnoses. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of OP and lung malignancy and report characteristics of these cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all lung pathology reports at Indiana University from January 1, 2010, to January 1, 2023, encompassing over 8,000 cases. Cases with histopathologic diagnoses of OP with and without lung malignancy were identified; relevant clinical, radiologic, and follow-up data were extracted. Using language extraction, we identified pathology cases showing both organizing pneumonia and carcinoma (Cohort 1) and transbronchial biopsies identified as "organizing pneumonia" (Cohort 2). Cohort 2 was selected to reflect current clinical practice. RESULTS: In Cohort 1 (n=57), 88% of samples demonstrating both organizing pneumonia and malignancy were obtained via surgical resection. Among these, squamous cell carcinoma accounted for 46% and adenocarcinoma for 37% of cases, with all T-stages represented (44% T1, 29% T2, 16% T3, and 11% T4). In this cohort, thirty-eight prior biopsy samples prior to surgery were reviewed; 76% revealed malignancy, but none showed definitive organizing pneumonia likely due to focal nature of OP. Cohort 2 (n=40), 7.5% of patients in whom organizing pneumonia was identified through minimally invasive bronchoscopic sampling were ultimately diagnosed with concurrent lung cancer. All required repeat tissue sampling for cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Lung malignancy is known to be associated with OP. A high degree of suspicion should be maintained if OP is found on minimally invasive techniques, particularly if malignancy is strongly suspected.</description>

The aim of this study is to evaluate hybrid [18F]FDG PET/MRI's diagnostic accuracy in EC staging and role in predicting tumor aggressiveness, molecular characterization, and recurrence. Methods: A prospective study (ClinicalTrials.gov, ID:NCT04212910) evaluating EC patients undergoing [18F]FDG PET/MRI before surgery (2018-2024). Histology, immunohistochemistry, and patients' follow-up (mean FU time: 3.13y) were used as the reference standard. [18F]FDG PET/MRI, PET only, and MRI only were independently reviewed to assess the diagnostic accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), and positive/negative predictive value (PPV, NPV). Imaging parameters were extracted from [18F]FDG PET and pcT1w, T2w, DWI, and DCE MRI. Spearman's correlations, Fisher's exact test, ROC-AUC analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were applied. Results: Eighty participants with primary EC (median age 63 ± 12 years) were enrolled, with 17% showing LN involvement. [18F]FDG PET/MRI provided ACC = 98.75%, SN = 98.75%, and PPV = 100% for primary tumor detection, and ACC = 92.41%, SN = 84.62%, SP = 93.94%, PPV = 73.33%, and NPV = 96.88% for LN detection. PET/MRI parameters predicted LN involvement (AUC = 79.49%), deep myometrial invasion (79.78%), lymphovascular space invasion (82.00%), p53abn (71.47%), MMRd (74.51%), relapse (82.00%), and postoperative administration of adjuvant therapy (79.64%). Patients with a tumor cranio-caudal diameter ≥ 43 mm and MTV ≥ 13.5 cm3 showed increased probabilities of recurrence (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: [18F]FDG PET/MR showed exceptional accuracy in EC primary tumor and LN detection. Derived parameters demonstrated potential ability in defining features of aggressiveness, molecular alterations, and tumor recurrence.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bell JB, Saint-Germain MA, Yuen CA, Wilmington A, Dresser L, Walker MT, Trevino CR, Salvatori R, Mukherjee D, Kamson DO, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1635097'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1635097&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41626179/'&gt;41626179&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The scope of comorbid conditions with meningiomas is understudied. There is limited published evidence to date suggesting higher prevalence of thyroid diseases in patients with meningiomas. This retrospective study was designed to evaluate this association. METHODS: The medical records from 584 patients with intracranial meningiomas were reviewed. The prevalence of thyroid disease was calculated as well as odds ratios to compare patient cohorts. Subsequently, the results were externally validated using SlicerDicer data from a second institution's electronic medical record. RESULTS: Within the Endeavor Intracranial Meningioma cohort, thyroid disease was found in 196/584 (33.6%): hypothyroidism in 154/584 (26.4%), nodular disease in 34/584 (5.8%), thyroid cancer in 9/584 (1.5%), and hyperthyroidism in 8/584 (1.4%) patients. An additional 9/584 (1.5%) patients had a different thyroid disease or diagnosis. Our external validation with patients only from the second institution yielded significant association of meningioma with thyroid hormone medication use (OR = 6.1), hypothyroidism (OR = 7.5), thyroid cancer (OR = 14.6), hyperthyroidism (OR = 5.9), and thyroid nodules (OR = 10.8). Comparing meningioma patients to patients with glioblastoma yielded a similar association between meningioma and general thyroid disorders (OR = 2.1), thyroid hormone usage (OR = 2.1), hypothyroidism (OR = 1.7), thyroid cancer (OR = 3.1), and thyroid nodules (OR = 7.5). These observations were not confounded by female overrepresentation. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms thyroid disease, particularly hypothyroidism, to be a common comorbid condition in patients with intracranial meningiomas in two independent datasets. Further research is needed to assess the role of thyroid disorders in the outcomes for patients with meningioma.</description>

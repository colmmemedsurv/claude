      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Loriot Y, Powles T, Moreno V, Kang TW, Cicin I, Girvin A, Akapame S, O'Hagan A, Zhu W, Tammaro M, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00826'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00826&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41538748/'&gt;41538748&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: First-line treatment options for cisplatin-ineligible patients with metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) are limited. We conducted a phase II study of erdafitinib, alone or with cetrelimab, in FGFR-altered mUC. METHODS: Adults with mUC and select FGFR alterations who are ineligible for cisplatin were randomly assigned 1:1 in a noncomparative design to once-daily erdafitinib 8 mg (with pharmacodynamically guided uptitration to 9 mg) or erdafitinib 8 mg plus intravenous cetrelimab 240 mg once every 2 weeks at cycles 1-4 and 480 mg once every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were investigator-assessed confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and safety; secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). No statistical hypotheses were tested. RESULTS: At data cutoff, 87 patients were randomly assigned and treated (erdafitinib, n = 43; erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, n = 44). Of 64 patients with PD-L1 expression data, 56 (87.5%) had low levels of PD-L1 expression (combined positive score &lt;10). Median survival follow-up was 14.2 months. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib was 44.2% (95% CI, 29.1 to 60.1) with one complete response (CR); median DOR and median OS were 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to not estimable [NE]) and 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.3 to NE), respectively. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib plus cetrelimab was 54.5% (95% CI, 38.8 to 69.6), with six (13.6%) CRs; median DOR and median OS were 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.8 to NE) and 20.8 months (95% CI, 12.0 to NE), respectively. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83.7% and 68.2% in erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab groups, respectively), stomatitis (69.8% and 56.8%), and dry mouth (37.2% and 56.8%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 46.5% and 45.5% of patients receiving erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, respectively. CONCLUSION: First-line erdafitinib monotherapy and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in cisplatin-ineligible patients with mUC.</description>

The expression, prognostic, single-cell value, immune cell infiltration, and immune check-point (ICI) of TRPV1 in pan-cancer were assessed. Functional assays were performed to evaluate the effect of TRPV1 in vitro. TRPV1 was significantly upregulated in 13 cancers, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, the expression of TRPV1 was significantly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and ICI. Cellular function and western blot experiments revealed that TRPV1 may be required for cancer cell migration in head and neck cancer and lung cancer by inhibition of PI3K/AKT and promotion of immune cell infiltration and autophage. Our study suggests that TRPV1 may be able to regulate the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune-related physiological activities and thereby regulating the occurrence and progression of cancers. Thus, TRPV1 could be used to develop new-targeted drugs for cancers.</description>

Current evidence-based treatments for AN have limited efficacy, with less than half of the patients achieving full recovery in long-term follow-up studies. Recent findings have identified gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis as a potential contributor to AN pathology through the gut-brain axis. This open-label, non-randomized, feasibility trial (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05834010) evaluated the feasibility of utilizing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to modify the GM and GM-associated signaling in females with AN and to examine biological effects following a single FMT procedure. Adult female participants diagnosed with AN were recruited. FMT was administered either orally via capsules or as rectal enema. Stool and blood samples were collected pre- and one week post-FMT to assess GM composition, hormonal changes, and biomarkers. Primary endpoints: Feasibility of FMT in individuals with AN and preferred route of FMT. Secondary endpoints: A single FMT treatment can alter GM composition in individuals with AN short term and relevant gut brain signaling in serum. 18/22 participants (81%) completed FMT and sampling and 19/22 participants chose oral capsules, with no serious adverse effects reported. GM analysis showed significant shifts toward donor composition 1-week post-FMT, with improved stool consistency. No significant changes were observed in psychopathology measures or appetite-related biomarkers. Oral FMT is a feasible intervention for adult women with AN, leading to changes in GM profile. Future studies should focus on placebo-controlled trials to assess the efficacy of repeated oral treatments and explore long-term effects on GM, appetite, body weight, sex hormones, disorder-specific symptoms, and overall well-being.</description>

Pathogenic LINE-1 (pL1HS) retrotransposons promote LUSC progression by fostering immune evasion. Elucidation of the mechanistic link between retrotransposon activity and TME reprogramming could help identify strategies to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Here, we conducted integrated multi-omics analyses, including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with proteomics, that revealed hyperactivated cGAS-STING signaling and a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-rich TME in pL1HS+ LUSC. Mechanistically, LINE-1 open reading frame 1 protein (L1-ORF1p) underwent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its intrinsically disordered region, forming cytosolic condensates that scaffolded pL1HS nucleic acid, HMGN2, and cGAS into a ternary complex. This complex sustained chronic non-canonical NF-κB signaling-dependent cGAS-STING activation, which in turn drove immune suppression via MDSCs recruitment and activation. The coiled-coil domain of L1-ORF1p stabilized these condensates by binding HMGN2, perpetuating this immunosuppressive cascade. Dual targeting of pL1HS and cGAS restored anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor growth in preclinical models. Together, this work reveals a therapeutically actionable LLPS-driven axis that can be targeted with a combinatorial strategy to overcome immune evasion in LUSC, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.</description>

Despite advancement in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), there are currently no established guidelines delineating the appropriate surgical extent for defining adequate ESS in cases of primary diffuse CRS. METHODS: Through a modified Delphi technique, 33 statements regarding the extent of surgery for each paranasal sinus were drafted following a literature review and submitted to an expert panel composed of 15 internationally recognized ESS experts. A consensus meeting was held to discuss the results for each iteration. An additional statement was added during the meeting, and a total of 34 statements were voted on during the last round. RESULTS: Consensus was reached in 17 statements out of 34. Type 1 medial maxillary antrostomy, bilateral anteroposterior ethmoidectomy, and at least DRAF I frontal sinusotomy should be performed in all cases of primary diffuse CRS, with a particular focus on mucosal sparing, regardless of the likelihood of subsequently needing biologic therapy. DRAF III frontal sinusotomy should not be considered as a first-line approach even in patients with risk factors for recurrence. Treatment of the sphenoid sinus might be avoided in cases where it is not involved by the pathology. CONCLUSION: This document outlines a consensus on the appropriate surgical approach for primary diffuse CRS, aiming to promote standardization while preserving individual clinical judgment.</description>

However, emerging evidence from other organ systems suggests mucosal and muscle compartments engage in reciprocal interactions with functional consequences. We hypothesized that similar crosstalk exists in the VF, whereby fibrotic mucosa influences adjacent muscle. To model this process, we stimulated human VF fibroblasts (HVOX) with TGF-β1, a central mediator of fibrosis, and examined the effects on rat VF myoblasts (rVF-Mbs), as well as reciprocal influences of rVF-Mbs on fibroblasts. METHODS: HVOX fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1, and the effects on rVF-Mbs were assessed using conditioned media and co-culture. Myotube formation was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and nuclear localization of Smad2/3 was examined in conditioned media experiments. qRT-PCR quantified transcripts related to myogenic differentiation and Smad2/3 signaling. ALK4/5 inhibition was performed in co-culture to test TGF-β/Smad2/3-signaling pathway involvement. Reciprocal effects were examined by changes in fibrogenic gene expression in HVOX fibroblasts. RESULTS: Both conditioned media and co-culture suppressed myogenic differentiation in rVF-Mbs; increased inhibition was observed in co-culture, as indicated by reduced myotube formation, decreased Myh2 expression, and activation of Smad2/3 signaling. ALK4/5 inhibition abrogated these effects. Differentiating rVF-Mbs attenuated the fibrogenic phenotype of HVOX fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrotic VF mucosal cells can impair myogenic differentiation through TGF-β/Smad2/3-mediated fibroblast-myoblast crosstalk, and myogenic cells may exert reciprocal anti-fibrotic effects. These findings suggest mucosa-muscle interactions may contribute to VF pathology and highlight Smad2/3 as a potential therapeutic target. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA STUDY DESIGN: In vitro.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 300 patients aged over 65 with inoperable ESCC who underwent IMRT. Patients were randomly allocated to a training set (n = 211) and a validation set (n = 89) in a 7:3 ratio. Prognostic variables were initially screened using univariate Cox regression, followed by variable selection via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Independent predictors were identified through multivariate Cox analysis and incorporated into a nomogram model. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index, receiver operating characteristic curves, and calibration curves, with the model's discriminative ability further validated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Four independent prognostic factors were identified: age ≥ 70 years (HR = 1.50, P = 0.019), Karnofsky performance status score ≥ 80 (HR = 0.54, P = 0.003), radiotherapy dose ≥ 58 Gy (HR = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), and serum albumin ≥ 40 g/L (HR = 0.70, P = 0.041). The nomogram demonstrated predictive ability for 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS), with better predictive performance for 5-year OS. The area under the curve values in the training cohort were 0.732 and 0.681, while those in the validation cohort were 0.570 and 0.740, respectively. Calibration and decision curve analyses confirmed the clinical utility and accuracy of the model. Compared to the AJCC 8th edition TNM staging system, the nomogram exhibited superior long-term prognostic performance in this population. CONCLUSION: This study proposes a clinical nomogram model to assist clinicians in predicting the survival of elderly patients with inoperable ESCC undergoing IMRT and formulating treatment plans.</description>

We evaluated the associations between oral broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotic use and eoCRC. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Cases were persons aged 15-49 years with in situ or invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma (2009-2021); controls were individually matched 10:1 on age, sex, and length of KPSC membership. Those with ≥15 years of membership were included to assess exposure 2-15 years earlier. Data were collected from electronic health records. Crude and multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate antibiotic use from 10-14.9, 5-9.9, and 2-4.9 years before diagnosis/index date with risk of overall CRC, colon, and rectal cancer. RESULTS: A total of 295 cases and 2,794 controls were included. In the 10-14.9 years before diagnosis/index date, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was not associated with eoCRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for any use=1.07 (95% CI: 0.82-1.40)]; aOR for &gt;90 days cumulative use =1.40 (0.82-2.38)]. An elevated risk of colon adenocarcinoma was suggested for &gt; 90 days cumulative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [aOR=2.04 (1.09-3.85)]. No clear association was observed for broad-spectrum antibiotic use within 5-9.9 or 2-4.9 years prior to diagnosis or with rectal cancer during any period, or for narrow-spectrum antibiotics in any exposure window. CONCLUSIONS: An association between long-term cumulative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and early-onset colon cancer is suggested. IMPACT: Further investigation into antibiotics and eoCRC risk by duration of use and window of exposure is warranted.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hofmann S, Schlachter S, Gast M, Erschens R, Schröpel C, Diebig M, Gritzka S, Lehmann JAM, Schwarz E, Jarczok MN, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC public health | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-025-26088-4'&gt;10.1186/s12889-025-26088-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41527061/'&gt;41527061&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Leadership in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is associated with a variety of challenges and stressors, which are reflected in their managers' commonly experienced high stress levels. In this context, psychological strain can arise, but compared to large companies, SMEs face particular difficulties in implementing mental health promotion intervention. These difficulties partially originate in a profound lack of comprehensive research on the effectiveness and prospects of success of intervention strategies in SMEs. This study aims to close this gap by evaluating a stress management training for managers in SMEs (KMU-GO). Implementing established stress management strategies and making them more accessible within the SME context, the training aims to improve participants' psychological and physiological well-being. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with an intervention and a waitlist control group in Germany. The intervention comprised 1.5 days of stress management training and two refresher sessions, focusing on short- and long-term coping strategies and self-reflection. Based on a sample of N = 155 managers, we conducted a multilevel analysis of covariance on psychological measures, namely stress reactivity, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, changes in physiological stress indices (i.e., hair cortisol concentration and salivary alpha-amylase activity) were examined. RESULTS: Regarding the psychological measures, we found significant training effects six months after baseline. Twelve months after baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups for either psychological or physiological variables. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present stress management training is effective in reducing psychological strain in SME managers. In order to achieve more sustainable effects, a continuation of the refresher sessions could be considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Before including the first participant, the KMU-GO trial is registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS): DRKS00023457 (registered on 5 November 2020).</description>

Digital tools tailored to their linguistic and cultural needs are limited. This study reports the development and preliminary evaluation of MoDeHe (Mobile Dentist Hearing), a novel mobile application designed to improve communication and support dental management for DHH individuals. METHODS: MoDeHe was fully developed by a multidisciplinary team, incorporating input from DHH consultants and dental professionals. The application consists of two main modules: (i) the Patient Information module, which provides educational sign language (SL) videos on oral health and common dental procedures, and (ii) the Dental Examination module, which includes SL-supported decision trees to facilitate communication during clinical examinations. A pre-post observational study was conducted with 39 DHH participants. Baseline measures included self-reported oral health status and items from the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale. Post-test measures assessed usability, satisfaction, communication preferences, and confidence attending dental care independently. RESULTS: At baseline, 82.1% of participants had not visited a dentist in over two years and 89.7% perceived their oral health as poor. Communication barriers contributed to cancelled appointments (69.2%) and reliance on interpreters (61.5%). After interacting with MoDeHe, 97.4% reported satisfaction, 66.7% preferred the app as their primary communication facilitator, and 84.6% felt confident visiting the dentist without an interpreter. CONCLUSIONS: MoDeHe is an innovative mobile health (mHealth) solution developed specifically for DHH individuals to enhance communication and accessibility in dental care. Its offline functionality and culturally adapted SL content support scalability in diverse, resource-limited settings. Future studies should assess long-term clinical usability and adaptation to regional SL variations.</description>

OMD images also have insufficient supervision information and fuzzy lesion boundaries, failing to meet mobile medicine's high accuracy requirements. METHODS: To solve these issues, we proposed a weakly supervised OMD segmentation model with multi-task collaboration (WSSM). Using Mamba as the backbone, WSSM realizes efficient lesion segmentation via classification-segmentation dual-branch collaboration. The classification branch captures multi-directional, multi-scale features via a dedicated network, and its pseudo-label module fuses class activation maps, box annotations, and predictive annotations for deeper supervision. The segmentation branch adopts a symmetric network to extract overall lesion features, with a boundary adaptive module enhancing fuzzy boundary representation to improve accuracy. RESULTS: Experiments on the OMD dataset demonstrated that WSSM outperformed existing weakly supervised methods significantly, with its Dice index increasing by 6.06% compared to WSSL. CONCLUSIONS: Our model, with Mamba as the backbone (balancing local texture feature extraction and long-range semantic dependency modeling of OMD lesions), enables deeper supervision via dual-branch collaboration, significantly improving boundary segmentation accuracy in scenarios with insufficient OMD supervision and unclear boundaries.

However, distinguishing SjD-related dry mouth from idiopathic xerostomia (IX) remains challenging. This study evaluates whether elastography, an advanced ultrasonographic technique measuring gland stiffness, can improve differentiation. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 192 patients diagnosed with SjD (n = 83) or IX (n = 109) were assessed for xerostomia severity and underwent conventional, Doppler ultrasonography, and shear wave elastography (SWE) of salivary glands. Additional SjD-related indicators, including serological and pathological markers, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified key differentiators, and generalized additive model (GAM) examined nonlinear associations. RESULTS: SjD patients showed significantly higher parotid gland stiffness (23.9 ± 10.9 kPa) compared to IX patients (15.1 ± 6.7 kPa, p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, submandibular gland homogeneity and parotid stiffness were independent predictors of SjD. Multivariate analysis revealed parotid stiffness as the strongest factor associated with SjD (OR = 1.152 per kPa increase, 95% CI: 1.080-1.241). GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear exposure-response pattern, with the modeled proportion of SjD reaching approximately 50% at a parotid stiffness of 17.7 kPa. CONCLUSION: Parotid gland stiffness shows promise as a clinical tool for distinguishing SjD from IX.</description>

The aim of the present paper is to investigate the association between advanced stages of periodontitis (Stage III/IV) and the intensity and duration of sleep bruxism events, measured as bruxism work index (BWI) and bruxism time index (BTI) through surface electromyography. METHODS: Subjects were selected from patients regularly attending the School of Dentistry of the University of Siena, Siena, Italy, with the aim of having a test group of patients with periodontitis and a control group without periodontitis. Two calibrated operators performed the periodontal assessment. The sleep-time surface electromyographic activity of the left masseter muscle was registered through a portable device (dia-BRUXO, Biotech-Novations, Sanremo, Italy). Differences between cases and controls in the outcome variables concerning masseter activities were assessed. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups for the sleep bruxism work index and bruxism time index. Instead, a moderately negative significant correlation was found between the bruxism work index and the full mouth bleeding score. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced stages of periodontitis (Stage III and Stage IV) do not exhibit a higher frequency and intensity of sleep bruxism events compared to healthy individuals.</description>

In Asia, live-bird markets (LBMs) are key human-animal interfaces for zoonotic virus transmission. Traditional sampling strategies are time-consuming, expensive and carry significant biosafety risks. Here, we assess the performance of metagenomics on environmental samples (ES) versus traditional poultry swabs for detecting viral pathogens in two Cambodian LBMs between January 2022 and April 2023. ES, including air (n = 35), cage swabs (n = 17), carcass wash water (n = 17) and drinking water (n = 9) are collected alongside oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs from chickens (n = 30) and ducks (n = 29). ES is sensitive in detecting 40 viruses from pathogen families including Orthomyxoviridae and Coronaviridae. Air samples capture the greatest diversity of poultry viruses. Viral contigs from ES show high sequence identity to poultry swab contigs when aligned to the same gene. We show ES outperforms poultry samples in detecting the highly pathogenic influenza A/H5N1, including clades 2.3.4.4b and 2.3.2.1c, which are found in the environment but are missed by poultry swabs. Our findings show metagenomics on ES replicates traditional surveillance, offering broader coverage and improved pathogen detection. This approach could be pivotal for mitigating zoonotic spillover and enhancing pandemic preparedness.</description>

While polysomnography is the diagnostic gold standard for identifying OSA, its accessibility is limited. Mouth breathing is a key, observable symptom associated with P-OSA, and it can further increase OSA risk by altering craniofacial development. Recognizing mouth breathing can aid in the early diagnosis and treatment of P-OSA. AIM: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate and consolidate the existing evidence on the relationship between mouth breathing and P-OSA. DESIGN: The research question was framed using the PEO format. A comprehensive literature search was conducted through MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane and OVID up to September 2025. Study quality was assessed, and data were managed using Distiller SR software. RESULTS: The search identified 3722 articles. After removing duplicates, the articles were screened and reviewed, of which 13 studies - 2 cross-sectional and 11 cohort-met inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. Most studies reported a significant correlation between mouth breathing and OSA severity, with some identifying mouth breathing as a predictor of persistent OSA after adenotonsillectomy. However, variability in diagnostic methods contributed to inconsistent findings. CONCLUSION: The available literature suggests that mouth breathing is closely linked to P-OSA, playing a key role in both early diagnosis and ongoing assessment of treatment efficacy. Recognizing mouth breathing as an early marker of P-OSA underscores the need for vigilant assessment by healthcare providers.</description>

METHODS: An online survey was developed and emailed to practicing Australian Otolaryngologists, determined by membership and registration status with the Australian Society of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgeons (ASOHNS). RESULTS: Seventy-four of 507 ASOHNS members completed the survey. Only 20.3% completed Laryngology fellowships (n=15/74). Those who saw &lt;2 individual RRP patients/year were excluded, leaving 46 respondents. The majority (n=29/46) only operated on &lt;5 patients per year, typically adults (n=37/46). Lasers overall were the most common instrument used in adult patients (n=17/37), whilst the microdebrider in those who managed juvenile disease (n=9/17). Adjuvant therapy was used in 74.4%, stroboscopy in 58.1% and voice therapy in 86.1%. Laryngology-trained respondents saw more patients, used stroboscopy, recommended vaccination, used laser and adjuvant therapy more than other respondents. CONCLUSION: Our findings reflect the current trends of pre-operative, intraoperative and post-operative management of RRP amongst Australian Otolaryngology consultants. Many of these practices are consistent with findings from international literature, except for in-office procedures. Despite being a relatively rare disease, RRP presents a significant disease burden to the global population emphasising the importance of how it is managed. In recent decades, contemporary management options such as new ablative and angiolytic lasers and adjuvant options such as intralesional bevacizumab and the HPV vaccination have changed the way we manage RRP, particularly amongst the laryngology fellowship trained subspecialty population.</description>

DATA SOURCES: We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases from 2011 to November 30, 2024. The search included terms related to snoring, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and acoustic analysis. REVIEW METHODS: The review was structured using the PICO framework and adhered to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. A total of 591 records were identified, and 42 studies were included after screening and full-text review. Methodological quality was assessed using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) tool, and data extraction focused on ML models, data sets, feature extraction methods, and performance metrics. RESULTS: ML models such as support vector machine (SVMs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and hybrid deep learning architectures achieved high accuracy (up to 98.6%) in snore classification and OSA detection. Key features included mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), wavelet transforms, and deep spectral representations. Several studies attempted VOTE classification, reporting unweighted average recalls (UARs) of 49% to 75% with baseline pipelines, and up to 87.5% to 94.7% UAR or 92.2 to 95.5% accuracy when using targeted features with SVM or k-nearest neighbor (kNN). Challenges included limited external validation, data set imbalance, and noise interference. CONCLUSION: AI-driven snore analysis holds potential for noninvasive OSA screening and anatomical site classification. Future work should focus on multimodal data integration, real-world validation, and model generalizability to support clinical translation.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: US academic medical institutions. METHODS: The 2015 to 2024 Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) Faculty Salary Reports were analyzed. Univariate linear regressions assessed trends by gender in faculty representation and median compensation for OHNS, general surgery, ophthalmology, and neurosurgery. RESULTS: From 2015 to 2024, female representation increased at all ranks in OHNS. Assistant professors saw the fastest growth (+12.38/year, P &lt; .001), followed by associate professors (+6.99/year, P &lt; .001), professors (+4.68/year, P &lt; .001), chiefs (+0.59/year, P = .012) and chairs (+0.47/year, P = .004). Increases in female faculty outpaced growth for male faculty at all ranks except chief (chief [male]: +1.77/year, P = .017). Over this time, the gender pay difference narrowed significantly for assistant (-0.42%/year, P = .029) and associate professors (-0.86%/year, P = .008). Cross-specialty comparisons showed that ophthalmology had greater female representation at every rank compared to OHNS but saw a widening pay difference at the associate professor level (+1.17%/year, P = .038). General surgery had improved gender representation over the study period at all ranks except chair but without any significant changes in gender pay difference. For neurosurgery, the gender pay difference narrowed only for assistant professors (-0.74%/year, P = .016), but gender representation at this level did not improve (+0.16%/year, P = .28). CONCLUSION: Over the past decade, OHNS has demonstrated improvements in gender representation and pay equity at junior ranks, but differences persist at senior levels. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.</description>

The high postoperative recurrence rate of PACG is a problem, and a method of permanent drainage is desirable. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to investigate which techniques can achieve permanent drainage. METHODS: We report new symptomatic PACG cases treated by endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization using a nasoseptal mucosal flap (NSMF). To verify the safety, efficacy, and long-term preventive effect on recurrence using an NSMF during endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization, a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Library databases. RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up, our two patients, who each developed hypoglossal nerve palsy and abducens nerve palsy, experienced maintained patency to the sphenoid sinus and complete recovery of their symptoms. The systematic literature review of endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization for PACG revealed that the use of an NSMF was the most effective surgical procedure in select cases. The 5-year estimated recurrence-free survival rates were 46.0% in the simple drainage group, 80.7% in the drainage using stenting group, and 97.1% in the drainage using an NSMF group. CONCLUSION: Transsphenoidal marsupialization using an NSMF may prevent recurrence or stenosis of the opened orifice of the PACG cavity, whereas simple drainage often leads to recurrence. However, more importantly, this approach should be limited to cases in which wide or safe fenestration to the sphenoid sinus can be performed.</description>

To evaluate the efficacy of ITI versus VT using propensity score matching (PSM) in ARVA. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at the Tokyo Voice Center between July 2014 and December 2024 using medical records in ARVA. The intervention group comprised 197 of 210 patients who received ITI (mean voice recording period: 40.98 days after injection). The control group included 412 of 488 patients who underwent voice therapy (VT) between April 2015 and December 2024 (mean voice recording period: 79.91 days after initial VT). The primary outcome was defined as the improvement in VHI, calculated as the difference between post-treatment and pre-treatment scores. PMS was used to compare ITI and VT. RESULTS: Before PSM, the mean age and sex (female) were 65.30 years (standard deviation [SD], 14.01) and 48 patients (24.67%) in the ITI group and 64.81 years (SD, 14.42) and 246 patients (59.71%) in the VT group, respectively. T-tests revealed no significant differences in outcomes. After PSM (C-statistic = 0.746), the baseline characteristics were balanced (standardized mean difference &lt; 0.1). Post-matching, t-tests revealed significantly greater voice improvement in the ITI group (p = 0.023). CONCLUSION: ITI appears effective for improving voice outcomes in ARVA. Future studies should include prospective interventional trials and comparative analyses with other injectable agents to determine the most effective treatment.</description>

A recent consensus statement by the International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group (IPOG) reclassified lesions based on anatomic location rather than the classic germ cell layer classification. Type I FBCAs are external and superficial to the parotid fascia, and type II FBCAs are juxtaposed to, or involving, the parotid gland. The consensus statement supports extensive resection to prevent recurrence. We hypothesized that type II FBCAs may be multicentric. The objective of this study was to search for histological evidence of this characteristic which, if present, supports the recommendation of the IPOG consensus for extended surgical resection. METHODS: Archived histopathologic resections of type II FBCAs were evaluated for satellite lesions or filamentous tracts off the main lesion indicating respiratory epithelium and extension of pathology beyond the typical resection. RESULTS: Pathologic analysis identified 22 archived tissue specimens with adequate histology to evaluate for the presence of FBCA tissue in the parotid gland. 6/22 (27.3%) demonstrated FBCA tissue external to the main lesion or multiple epithelial rests of similar tissue outside the primary lesion consistent with pathology beyond the primary cyst itself. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the notion that type 2 FBCAs are extensive and can be multicentric. These findings also support the clinical experience and recommendation of the IPOG consensus statement for a more extensive dissection and removal of surrounding tissue in the effort to best prevent recurrence.</description>

The Phase 3, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month, randomized clinical trial, MODIFY (NCT03425539), aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lucerastat in adults with FD with moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain. The single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) (NCT03737214) evaluated the longer-term safety and tolerability of lucerastat over 72 months. Lucerastat 1000 mg twice daily (n = 80), compared with placebo (n = 37), failed to affect neuropathic pain at Month-6, with no significant difference between treatment groups (LSM difference -0.42 [95% CI -1.23, 0.40], p = 0.32) (primary endpoint). In contrast, a decrease in baseline plasma Gb3 was observed at Month-6 in lucerastat-treated participants but not placebo-treated participants (LSM difference -873.53 ng/mL [95% CI -1097.53, -649.53], p &lt; 0.0001; NS due to hierarchical testing). In an unplanned OLE Month-18 interim analysis, the eGFR slope (mL/min/1.73m2/year) in 93 participants with pre- and post-randomization (23-month median lucerastat exposure) eGFR data was -3.50 (-5.04, -1.969) and -1.48 (-2.64, -0.33), respectively. Lucerastat was safe and well tolerated. Lucerastat's strong pharmacodynamic effect did not translate into an effect on neuropathic pain. The potential effect of lucerastat on renal function requires further investigation (Trial registration NCT03425539, NCT03737214; 2017-003369-85, 2018-002210-12.

METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of annual survey of the Society of Physician Assistants in Otorhinolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery (SPAO-HNS) data, collected 2015 to 2024. The survey captured self-reported practice patterns, compensation models, and clinical responsibilities. Statistical analyses included linear and logistic regressions to evaluate temporal trends and differences by practice setting. RESULTS: A total of 1227 survey responses were analyzed. Most respondents were physician assistants (93.7%), predominantly working in private stand-alone otolaryngology practice environments (66.8%). Majority of respondents reported working an average of 40 hours per week with salary-based compensation (71.8%), though productivity-based bonuses rose over the study period (P =&lt; .001). Common procedures performed independently included cerumen removal, foreign body extraction, and nasal endoscopy or flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Practice setting influenced patient volume and scope of responsibilities, with stand-alone practices reporting higher outpatient volumes. The proportion of respondents planning to leave otolaryngology within 5 years nearly doubled from 17% in 2015 to 29% in 2024. CONCLUSION: This 10-year longitudinal analysis highlights the integral and evolving contributions of physician assistants and nurse practitioners to otolaryngology care across diverse practice settings. The findings document an expanding role in enhancing access to care and performing office procedures independently. However, the rising proportion of respondents intending to leave the field signals emerging workforce sustainability challenges. Proactive strategies to support recruitment, retention, and professional development are needed to ensure a stable and effective otolaryngology workforce capable of meeting growing patient needs.</description>

METHODS: Adults who underwent office-based transnasal double balloon dilations of the PES at a single academic institution over a 3-year period were retrospectively studied. Clinicodemographic data, prior PES dilation history, procedural indications, pre-procedure anxiolytic usage, procedural data including the number of office-based double balloon dilation procedures performed and dilation diameter, complications, and subjective outcomes at 2 weeks post-dilation were recorded. RESULTS: Nineteen office-based double balloon dilations to 24 mm (12 + 12-mm balloons) were performed in seven patients (mean age: 65.3 years, 57.1% female). Indications for dilation were varied. Two (28.6%) patients had a history of oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy. No patients were post-laryngectomy. The majority (85.7%) of patients underwent at least one prior in-office transnasal single balloon dilation. Two (28.6%) patients required a pre-procedure anxiolytic. One complication occurred involving post-procedure epistaxis that resolved with topical oxymetazoline application. No esophageal lacerations or perforations were encountered. No procedures required early termination due to poor patient tolerance. The majority (71.4%) of patients reported subjective improvement in dysphagia symptoms at 2-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: Double balloon dilation of the PES is feasible in unsedated patients in the office setting.</description>

Distinguishing between the two can be challenging when serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are severely elevated. Carcinomas classically present with markedly increased values and more severe clinical symptoms. METHODS: Clinical data was obtained via retrospective chart review and literature review. RESULTS: Three cases of female patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism with markedly elevated PTH levels (755-3547.4 pg/mL) underwent uncomplicated parathyroid adenoma excision with no histopathologic evidence of malignancy. Appropriate intraoperative reduction in PTH levels was observed, and all patients experienced normalization in calcium levels postoperatively. There is a notable deficit in available literature regarding similar cases. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rarity of parathyroid carcinoma, these exceptional cases and laboratory values serve as a valuable reminder for clinicians about the diverse presentations of adenomas.</description>

Advances in systemic therapy have altered the role of RT as preoperative therapy in patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, RT continues to play a central role in nonoperative management for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with mounting evidence in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The combination of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains an area of promise and ongoing investigation. In addition, ablative RT continues to show its utility in the management of patients with oligometastatic disease. Herein, we present a contemporary critical review of the evolving role of RT in esophageal cancer including as perioperative therapy, in combination with immunotherapy, its role in nonoperative management including the role of RT dose escalation in patients with cervical esophageal cancer, and its utility in the management of patients with oligometastatic disease.</description>

METHODS: Systematic scoping review. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 2024 for cancer survivorship studies conducted in Australia, with studies reporting data for people with advanced or metastatic cancer classified using NCI's priority research themes. RESULTS: We identified 483 studies, of which 72 (14.9%) recruited and reported data for participants with advanced or metastatic cancer, focusing on: psychosocial research (51.4%); healthcare delivery (16.7%); health behaviors (12.5%); symptom management (11.1%); and epidemiology and surveillance (8.3%). Most were conducted within individual Australian states (72.2%) and involved multiple cancer types (41.7%). Study designs included qualitative (44.4%), cross-sectional (34.7%), cohort (16.7%), case-control (1.4%), case report (1.4%) and mixed methods (1.4%). Forty-two tumor-specific studies were identified including breast (33.3%), hematological (21.4%); prostate (11.9%); bowel/colorectal (11.9%), gynecological (9.5%), melanoma (7.1%), head and neck (2.4%), and lung (2.4%) cancers. Nearly a quarter of studies recruited participants via cancer registries (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Few cancer survivorship studies included people with advanced or metastatic cancer in Australia. We offer six recommendations to support funders, clinicians, policymakers, and researchers to improve representation of advanced or metastatic cancer survivors in survivorship research programs. Similar efforts in other countries are needed. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Increasing numbers of people are living long-term with advanced or metastatic cancer. The purposeful inclusion of these people in cancer survivorship research and care programs will improve health outcomes.</description>

Phage therapy offers a promising alternative treatment strategy against biofilm-associated infections, though its use remains mostly ad hoc and typically considered a last-resort intervention. We report here the treatment of a refractory, fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa VGI using a systematically planned and synergistic phage-antibiotic combination approach. Adjunctive phage therapy led to radiological improvement, as seen by reduced 18F-FDG PET/CT tracer uptake around the graft. The patient was transitioned to oral fluoroquinolone suppression therapy with no recurrence of bacteremia to-date, after a year. Our workflow led to the selection of phages that sensitized Pseudomonas aeruginosa to killing by levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. We established that this phage-driven antibiotic sensitization was due to the ability of our phages to use the MexAB-OprM efflux pump as a receptor. We also showed that our phages had potent anti-biofilm activity. We advocate a systematic, multi-pronged management strategy for refractory VGIs, including early therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT), and timely adjunctive phage therapy. This case illustrates the utility of individualized, strategic approaches and highlights adjunctive phage therapy's potential in treating complex biofilm-related infections.</description>

The transcription factor KLF5 is frequently genomically amplified and activated in multiple epithelial cancers, highlighting the need to define its role in the transformation of normal epithelium to cancer. Here, we used genetically engineered organoids to identify the function of KLF5 in tumorigenesis of multiple endodermal epithelial cancers. KLF5 activation drove a series of morphological and molecular events during the stepwise transformation of normal airway epithelium towards lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by remodeling protein biosynthesis and energy metabolism. Inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation attenuated the malignant progression of LUSC driven by KLF5. In summary, this study identified KLF5 as a crucial transcriptional modulator in LUSC oncogenesis and indicated that KLF5-activated LUSC may be therapeutically vulnerable to inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation.</description>

Medical cannabis has shown promise for symptom management, yet high-quality data are lacking because of regulatory barriers in conducting cannabis research. Partnering with state cannabis programs may represent a novel pathway to conduct cannabis trials. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial of medical cannabis for 32 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with ≥1 symptoms in Minnesota. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to early (0-8 weeks) or delayed (9-16 weeks) cannabis intervention (certification, education, provision of cannabis products) through the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program. The primary study period was 0-8 weeks when only the early arm received the intervention. The primary outcome was feasibility. Secondary outcomes included acceptability, and changes in symptom burden and quality of life examined in exploratory efficacy analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 34 patients, 32 of whom began the study (median age 71 years, 53% women). Patients reported substantial moderate-to-severe baseline symptom burden: insomnia (85%), pain (77%), and appetite loss (69%). The study met prespecified feasibility benchmarks (74% enrollment (goal ≥20%), 81% compliance with arm allocation (goal ≥60%), and 75% patient-reported outcome completion rate [goal ≥50%]). All early arm participants recommended the intervention to others. The median daily tetrahydrocannabinol use was 7.3 mg at 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, early arm patients experienced numerically higher rates of improvement in pain (44% v 20%, P = .35), appetite (56% v 30%, P = .37), and insomnia (67% v 30%, P = .18), and lower rates of worsening cannabis-related harms (eg, dry mouth [11% v 20%, P = .99]). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a model collaboration between investigators and a state cannabis program to overcome regulatory barriers to conducting interventional cannabis research. The encouraging preliminary efficacy and safety of cannabis in managing symptoms supports further exploration.</description>

We report updated overall survival and longer-term efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: CARTITUDE-4 is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial at 81 hospital sites in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Eligible patients were adults (aged &gt;18 years) with lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma, with one to three previous treatment lines, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. After the trial started, the threshold defining measurable disease was lowered to 0·5 g/dL from 1·0 g/dL serum monoclonal paraprotein on July 2, 2021, to increase trial access. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised algorithm and balanced with permuted blocks, with stratification by physician's choice of pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone versus daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone, International Staging System stage, and number of previous treatment lines. Patients were assigned to cilta-cel (apheresis, bridging therapy [at least one pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone or daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone cycle], lymphodepletion, then cilta-cel infusion [0·75 × 106 CAR T cells per kg]) or standard of care (pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone [21-day cycles: 4 mg/day oral pomalidomide on days 1-14; 1·3 mg/m2 subcutaneous bortezomib twice a week for 2 weeks for eight cycles, then once a week for 2 weeks per cycle; 20 mg or, if aged &gt;75 years, 10 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for eight cycles, then days 1, 2, 8, and 9 per cycle] or daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone [28-day cycles: 1800 mg subcutaneous daratumumab weekly for 2 cycles, every 2 weeks for four cycles, then every 4 weeks; 4 mg/day oral pomalidomide on days 1-21; 40 mg/week or, if aged &gt;75 years, 20 mg/week oral or intravenous dexamethasone]). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, previously published. In this Article, we report a prespecified second interim analysis of overall survival and an updated analysis of progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04181827) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Patients were randomly assigned between July 10, 2020, and Nov 17, 2021, to receive cilta-cel (n=208) or standard of care (n=211). At a median follow-up of 33·6 months (IQR 20·3-35·0), median progression-free survival was not reached (95% CI 34·5 months-not evaluable) in the cilta-cel group versus 11·8 months (9·7-14·0) in the standard-of-care group (HR 0·29 [95% CI 0·22-0·39]). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI not evaluable) with cilta-cel versus not reached (37·7 months-not evaluable) with standard of care (HR 0·55 [95% CI 0·39-0·79]; p=0·0009). 30 (14%) of 208 patients in the cilta-cel group and 77 (37%) of 208 in the standard-of-care group had maximum grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, most commonly anaemia (72 [35%]) in the cilta-cel group and neutropenia (59 [28%]) in the standard-of-care group. Rates of maximum grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 156 (75%) with cilta-cel and 116 (56%) with standard of care, most commonly neutropenia (152 [73%] with cilta-cel and 112 [54%] with standard of care). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 98 (47%) patients in each group. Deaths in the safety population occurred in 50 (24%) in the cilta-cel group and 82 (39%) in the standard-of-care group, including due to treatment-related adverse events in six (3%; four due to infection) in the cilta-cel group and five (2%; all due to infection) in the standard-of-care group. INTERPRETATION: The significantly improved overall survival and patient-reported measures in CARTITUDE-4 reinforce the use of cilta-cel in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as early as after first relapse.

METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed (1996-February 2025), Embase (1947-February 2025), Web of Science (1997-February 2025), Cochrane Library (1996-February 2025) (pre-inception retroactively indexed studies, January 1900-February 2025); 13 included in our meta-analysis. Stata 18.0 computed pooled RRs (95% CIs); heterogeneity assessed via publication bias, subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The study incorporated thirteen studies. It is evident that there is a statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of vitiligo and an elevated risk of developing thyroid cancer (RR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.19, 2.12]). Conversely, a significant reduction in risk was observed for overall cancer (RR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.66, 0.90]), cancers of the respiratory system (RR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.66, 0.84]), digestive system (RR = 0.74, 95% CI [0.63, 0.87]), and skin cancers (RR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.36, 0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a dual cancer risk profile in vitiligo: increased risk for thyroid cancer, but decreased risk for overall cancer, internal malignancies (respiratory and digestive systems) and skin cancers. These findings suggest the potential need for customized cancer surveillance strategies and investigation into preventive interventions.</description>

However, the association between newly defined nocturnal stage 1 hypertension (nocturnal BP 110-120/65-70 mm Hg) and kidney function progression in the population not receiving dialysis with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nocturnal stage 1 hypertension as defined by 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines in patients with CKD is associated with kidney function progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study involving patients with CKD not receiving dialysis was conducted in China at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from August 2010 to December 2017 and at the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from November 2017 to December 2024. EXPOSURE: Participants were categorized into 3 groups based on nocturnal BP measurements according to the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines: nonhypertension (nocturnal BP &lt;110/65 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (nocturnal BP 110-120/65-70 mm Hg), and stage 2 hypertension (nocturnal BP ≥120/70 mm Hg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) and worsening kidney function (WKF). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Cox regression models were employed to assess the association between nocturnal stage 1 hypertension and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 2418 participants with CKD stage 1 through 4 not receiving dialysis included in the study, 1412 (58.4%) were men, the mean (SD) age was 45.4 (14.4) years, 436 (18.0%) had nocturnal nonhypertension, 345 (14.3%) had nocturnal stage 1 hypertension, and 1637 (67.7%) had nocturnal stage 2 hypertension. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.9 (1.5-4.7) years, 394 composite kidney outcomes, 203 cases of KFRT, and 235 instances of WKF were recorded. After adjusting for confounders, nocturnal stage 1 hypertension (compared with nocturnal nonhypertension) was independently associated with an increased risk of KFRT (hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.17-4.82), WKF (HR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.04-13.84), and the composite kidney outcome (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.31-4.72). In the older population (aged ≥65 years), nocturnal BP less than 110/65 mm Hg was associated with a higher risk of WKF and the composite kidney outcome compared with nocturnal BP in the range of 110/65 to 120/70 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of adults with CKD not receiving dialysis, nocturnal stage 1 hypertension as defined by the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines was independently associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gage CB, Kamholz JC, Powell JR, Nassal MMJ, Wang HE, Panchal AR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.53413'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.53413&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41525070/'&gt;41525070&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: During out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA), initial airway device choice as well as final device choice in the event of failure may both influence overall procedural success and patient outcomes. Understanding national practice patterns in airway device placement may inform resuscitation strategies and system-level quality improvement. OBJECTIVE: To assess patterns in the order of advanced airway device use for adults in the United States receiving OHCA treatment during emergency medical service (EMS) activations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cross-sectional study used data from the National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) database from January 2018 to December 2023. During this period, NEMSIS included more than 256 million EMS activations from nearly 14 000 agencies across 54 states and territories. Activations for 911 responses during adult OHCA with advanced airway device attempts after EMS arrival, with documented success (yes or no) and number of attempts, were included. EXPOSURES: Advanced airway devices documented by EMS clinicians. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: Order of advanced airway device use, measured by EMS clinician documentation. RESULTS: From 2018 to 2023, EMS reported 2 365 224 activations involving adults having an OHCA, with 650 440 patients (0.3%) receiving either endotracheal intubation (ETI) and/or supraglottic airway (SGA). Most patients received a successful initial airway device attempt (503 774 [77.4%]). Although ETI was the most common initial airway device (458 546 [70.5%]), SGA had a higher first-pass success rate (93.0% vs 71.0%). Among patients whose first ETI attempt failed (133 177 of 458 546 [29.0%]), the final documented device remained ETI in 72 167 cases (72.3%) and changed to SGA in 27 651 (27.7%). Among patients whose first SGA attempt failed, 13 480 (61.9%) remained with SGA and 3388 (38.1%) were switched to ETI. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, most patients with OHCA received ETI as the first advanced airway procedure, despite higher SGA first-pass success. Among patients whose initial attempt failed, most continued with the same device. However, switching from ETI to SGA had a higher final success rates. These findings highlight the importance of airway device sequence in prehospital care and may inform training and protocols for airway management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Livorsi DJ, Thompson AM, Green MS, Hoelscher AC, Chu KK, Neuner E, Burnett Y, Hopkins T, Walter E, Dave R, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.49655'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.49655&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41511774/'&gt;41511774&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Antibiotics prescribed at hospital discharge are frequently unnecessary or suboptimal. Strategies to improve prescribing are not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a discharge-focused prospective audit and feedback process decreases antibiotic overuse at hospital discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted across participating units at 10 hospitals with antibiotic stewardship (AS) teams and supporting staff from December 5, 2022, to November 17, 2023. After a 24-week baseline period, 1 hospital crossed into the intervention arm every 2 weeks. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of disseminating institutional guidelines for oral antibiotic step-down to frontline prescribers and conducting a prospective audit and feedback process for inpatients receiving antibiotics with an anticipated discharge date in the next 48 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was postdischarge antibiotic use. Secondary outcomes included inpatient antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and readmission. Manual electronic health record reviews were performed in 434 cases to assess optimal antibiotic prescribing at discharge for patients who met specific criteria. Analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis. RESULTS: There were 21 842 patient admissions (baseline, 14 288; intervention, 7554) across 10 hospitals. The median (IQR) age was 66 (53-75) years, with 13 380 (61.3%) males. At the hospital level, the mean (SD) number of patients audited by the AS team per week was 19.9 (5.8); approximately one-quarter of these audits (mean [SD], 5.0 [2.6]) resulted in feedback to the frontline prescribers. There were 3133 patients (21.9%) prescribed postdischarge antibiotics at baseline compared with 1645 patients (21.8%) during the intervention (odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.84-1.05]). The mean (SD) postdischarge antibiotic duration was 7.1 (5.2) days at baseline compared with 7.6 (5.6) days during the intervention (mean difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.50 to 0.53] days). There were no statistical differences during the intervention compared with baseline for inpatient antibiotic duration (mean [SD], 4.4 (3.6) vs 4.2 [3.5] days; mean difference, 0.04 [95% CI, -0.20 to 0.27] days), length of hospital stay (mean [SD], 5.4 [4.8] vs 5.4 [5.0] days; mean difference 0.11 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.33] days), or hospital readmission within 30 days (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.88-1.18]). Optimal antibiotic prescribing was more common during the intervention (122 of 264 cases [46.2%] vs 100 of 170 cases [58.8%]; odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.08-2.40]). A total of 112 inpatient frontline prescribers were sent a postintervention survey; 40 (35.7%) responded, and 34 of 36 (94.4%) believed that the initiative improved antibiotic prescribing at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this stepped-wedged cluster-randomized clinical trial conducted across 10 hospitals, discharge-focused prospective audit and feedback did not decrease antibiotic use at hospital discharge but did improve optimal antibiotic prescribing for common and uncomplicated diagnoses. Other AS strategies are needed to decrease unnecessary antibiotic prescribing at this transition of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClincialTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05471726.</description>

The present article describes organization of the pilot, evaluation of the program using key performance indicators (KPIs), and lessons learned. METHODS: Women age 30-55 years were invited for HPV screening via a communication campaign at 11 polyclinics in Karakalpakstan province. Samples were collected and analyzed locally in nine polyclinics using GeneXpert test. HPV-positive women were triaged with colposcopy, although colposcopists were not trained to obtain biopsies or perform treatment. Abnormal results led to further diagnostic colposcopy and treatment. Pilot data were managed using an Excel database, with quality assurance through regular monitoring visits and estimation of KPIs. RESULTS: Over 10 months, 50,000 women were tested for HPV, with 98% yielding satisfactory results and a 6.8% positivity rate. Of the HPV-positive women, 93.9% underwent triaging colposcopy, revealing abnormalities in 32.5%, although results varied by district. Diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology data were available for 87.9% of referrals. Treatment adherence was not systematically tracked. An external review showed 64.6% agreement with local histopathology, and the correlation between diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology was 53.2%. CONCLUSION: The pilot successfully recruited a large number of women and ensured high participation of the HPV-positive women in triage and diagnostic evaluation. Key strengths were the use of existing health infrastructure, and decentralization of services. However, challenges were identified in HPV test procurement, referral pathways, quality of pathology and colposcopy, and adequate data collection. Addressing these issues is critical to the future success of cervical cancer screening in Uzbekistan.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Oko-Oboh AG, Auvinen A, Obaseki DE, Pitkäniemi J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JCO global oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/GO-25-00318'&gt;10.1200/GO-25-00318&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41538752/'&gt;41538752&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Cancer burden in sub-Saharan Africa is high, driven by infections and behavioral risks. Nigeria had Africa's second-highest number of new cancers in 2022. This study estimated the proportion of new cancers attributable to alcohol, tobacco, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Edo State, Nigeria. METHODS: We analyzed cancer incidence data from the Edo-Benin Cancer Registry (EBCR; 2009-2018) for cancer sites associated with alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and HPV infection, as outlined in the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monographs. For each site, we calculated the number of attributable cancers and the population attributable fraction for the three exposures by sex, using country-specific exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates from previous research. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, the EBCR reported 4,937 cancer cases (2,069 men [41.9%] and 2,868 women [58.1%]). Nine alcohol-associated sites accounted for 30.1% of all cases (12.3% in men and 43% in women), 13 tobacco-related sites accounted for 27.5% (18.4% in men and 34.1% in women), and six HPV-related sites accounted for 15.2% (4% in men and 34.1% in women). Of alcohol-associated cancers (n = 1,488), 25.6% (381/1,488) were attributable to alcohol use; 5.3% (72/1,359) of smoking-related cancers were attributable to tobacco use, and high-risk HPV genotypes were estimated to cause 77.5% (581/750) of HPV-related cancers. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that nearly three fourths of HPV- and about one fourth of alcohol-associated cancers could be prevented through targeted and evidence-based interventions in Edo State, Nigeria. These findings highlight the need for strengthening both individual and policy-level prevention efforts, prioritizing high-impact risk factors to achieve measurable reductions in cancer burden.</description>

Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (nCIT) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) may improve outcomes, but their long-term efficacy remains unclear. Methods: This multicenter study analyzed LA-ESCC patients from three Chinese hospitals (2015-2024) who received nCIT or nCRT followed by surgery. Primary endpoint was 3-year overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), pathologic complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events. Propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics. Results: Among 225 patients (87 nCRT, 138 nCIT), matched cohorts (87 per group) showed that nCRT had higher ORR (85.06% vs. 45.98%), T/N downstaging rates (78.16% vs. 58.62%; 85.06% vs. 45.98%), and pCR (37.90% vs. 14.90%) (all p &lt; 0.01). After median follow-up (nCIT: 44.5 months; nCRT: 35.1 months), nCIT improved 3-year OS (75.90% vs. 55.60%) and DFS (66.40% vs. 47.30%) (p &lt; 0.05). Subgroup analysis favored nCRT in N+ or non-cT4 disease. Clinical N stage independently predicted survival. Conclusion: nCIT demonstrates superior survival benefits in LA-ESCC, while nCRT may be more effective for N+ or non-cT4 patients. Further randomized trials are warranted.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate whether sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improved liver-related outcomes in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and co-existing diabetes. Methods: Using data from the Korean nationwide cohort, this study included 37,629 patients with concurrent diabetes and chronic hepatitis B/C infection, without prior HCC, who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients who were treated with SGLT2is for over 90 days were allocated to the SGLT2i group, whereas those who never received SGLT2is comprised the non-SGLT2i group. The primary outcome was the occurrence of liver-related events, including HCC. Results: After 1:2 propensity score matching, the SGLT2i group comprised 12,543 patients (chronic hepatitis B, CHB: n = 9392; chronic hepatitis C, CHC: n = 4300, CHB &amp; CHC: n = 1149), while the non-SGLT2i group included 25,086 patients (CHB: n = 18,806; CHC: n = 8553, CHB &amp; CHC: 2273). The incidence rate of composite liver-related complications was lower in the SGLT2i group than that in the non-SGLT2i group (6.67 per 1000 vs. 8.99 per 1000). Moreover, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a reduced risk of HCC development (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-0.91; p = 0.002) and developing cirrhosis (sHR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.54-0.83; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: SGLT2is should be considered a therapeutic option for controlling diabetes, reducing the metabolic burden, and improving liver outcomes in patients with concurrent diabetes and chronic viral hepatitis.</description>

Mounting evidence suggests that microbial dysbiosis contributes to oncogenesis by driving chronic inflammation, producing genotoxic metabolites, altering bile acid metabolism, and disrupting epithelial barrier integrity. At the same time, the gut microbiome significantly modulates the host response to oncotherapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and especially immunotherapy, where microbial diversity and specific taxa determine treatment efficacy and toxicity. This review synthesizes current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in both oncogenesis and oncotherapies, focusing on thirteen cancers with the strongest and most clinically relevant microbiome associations, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, and melanoma. These cancers were selected based on robust mechanistic data linking microbial alterations to tumor initiation, progression, and therapy modulation, as well as their global health burden and translational potential. In addition, we have provided mechanistic insights or clinical correlations between the microbiome and cancer outcomes. Across cancers, common microbial mechanisms included pro-inflammatory signaling (e.g., NF-κB and STAT3 pathways), DNA damage from bacterial toxins (e.g., colibactin, nitrosating species), and metabolite-driven tumor promotion (e.g., secondary bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide). Conversely, beneficial commensals such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila supported antitumor immunity and improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In conclusion, the gut microbiome functions as both a driver of malignancy and a modifiable determinant of therapeutic success. Integrating microbiome profiling and modulation strategies such as dietary interventions, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation into oncology practice may pave the way for personalized and more effective cancer care.</description>

The first description of 'cancerous phthisis' was reported by Bayle in 1810. The results of subsequent attempts to establish an etiological correlation between the two clinical entities have ranged from insignificant-even antagonistic-to a direct causal relationship. This narrative review explores the relationship between tuberculosis and LC assessing overall and site-specific malignancy risks in individuals with TB compared with the general population. We also examine the timing of cancer development following TB, highlighting periods of elevated risk. Chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic changes associated with TB may contribute to tumor initiation and progression, with organ-specific factors influencing susceptibility to cancers such as lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal, and hematologic malignancies. Clinically, awareness of these interactions supports targeted TB screening in high-risk cancer patients, careful monitoring for TB reactivation during cancer therapy, and consideration of immunological and metabolic factors when planning treatment.</description>

This study evaluated the potential of X-ray Dark-Field Imaging Computed Tomography (XDFI CT) using synchrotron radiation for non-destructive, three-dimensional visualization of human lung cancer microstructures. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung cancer specimens (n = 4) were examined, including acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma (n = 1), adenocarcinoma after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (n = 1), keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in the lung (n = 1). Image acquisition was performed at beamline BL-14B of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), using a monochromatic 19.8 keV synchrotron X-ray beam and a crystal analyzer-based refraction-contrast optical system. Imaging findings were qualitatively correlated with corresponding histopathological sections. RESULTS: Synchrotron radiation XDFI CT enabled clear visualization of normal distal lung microanatomy, including alveolar walls and associated vascular structures, which served as internal references adjacent to tumor regions. Distinct microstructural features-such as invasive growth patterns, fibrotic or keratinized stroma, necrosis, and treatment-related remodeling-were identifiable and varied according to histological subtype. Tumor-normal tissue transitional zones were consistently delineated in all specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Synchrotron radiation XDFI CT provides high-resolution, non-destructive volumetric imaging of lung cancer tissues and reveals subtype-associated microarchitectural features. This technique may complement conventional histopathology by enabling three-dimensional virtual histologic assessment of lung cancer specimens.</description>

Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study of Korean adults aged ≥75 years who underwent standardized health screening. Exposures were body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and MetS defined by standard clinical criteria. The incidence of thyroid cancer was determined using administrative data. Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with prespecified stratification by sex and age (75-84 vs. ≥85 years). Results: Among 1,164,707 participants (60.3% women), 2645 incident cases were identified. In the fully adjusted models, obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) was associated with a 37% higher hazard (HR, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.49) and MetS with an 18% higher hazard (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28). In sex-stratified models, MetS was associated with thyroid cancer in women (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.31) and showed a similar direction of association in men (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.35), with overlapping CIs. By age, associations were evident at 75-84 years (MetS: HR, 1.18; obesity: HR, 1.36), whereas at ≥85 years, only obesity remained significant (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13-3.18). Among MetS components, high WC showed the most consistent association (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.42). Conclusions: In adults aged ≥75 years, general obesity and, in particular, central adiposity are robustly associated with incident thyroid cancer, whereas metabolic syndrome confers a more modest and mainly age- and sex-specific additional risk.</description>

However, oral and maxillofacial surgeons have limited education and exposure to AI in the clinical and administrative setting. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction of core concepts in commonly used AI models while providing relevant context in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). Challenges and potential solutions to development of AI in OMS are also discussed. FINDINGS: Preliminary studies using AI/ML in OMS have demonstrated high performance in metrics including sensitivity, specificity, Dice coefficient, intersection over union, and residual error. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral and maxillofacial surgeons should have a functional knowledge of AI technologies to guide development, testing, and adoption into OMS. With surgeon guidance, AI/ML has the potential for meaningful application across multiple clinical and administrative domains of OMS.</description>

Systemic chemotherapy plays a crucial role in the management of node-positive or metastatic cases; however, the supporting evidence predominantly originates from small, non-randomized studies. This review provides a narrative analysis of the cytotoxic classes and regimens employed in PSCC and compares major clinical guidelines to facilitate informed decision-making in practice. Methods: English-language reports were identified in PubMed/Scopus/Google Scholar without date limits. Selection prioritized objective response, survival and toxicity outcomes, and guidance statements across neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative settings. Results: Bleomycin-containing triplet regimens demonstrated efficacy but were associated with unacceptable pulmonary toxicity, leading to their discontinuation in clinical recommendations. Currently, cisplatin/taxane-based combinations remain fundamental in treatment protocols. The paclitaxel-ifosfamide-cisplatin (TIP) regimen achieves approximately 40-50% objective responses in phase II studies and may enable curative surgery, while taxane-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TPF) shows comparable efficacy with higher toxicity. For less fit patients, cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (PF) or carboplatin-taxane doublets are pragmatic alternatives. Single-agent taxanes or vinflunine offer modest second-line benefits. Although EAU-ASCO 2023, ESMO-EURACAN 2024, and NCCN v2.2025 are broadly in consensus, recommendations differ regarding eligibility thresholds and regimen preferences. Overall, the quality of the evidence remains low. Conclusions: TIP remains the reference neoadjuvant option for chemotherapy-fit patients with bulky nodal disease; doublets are reasonable when cisplatin fitness is limited; and bleomycin should be avoided. Harmonized eligibility criteria, biomarker-enriched studies, and coordinated multicenter trials are needed to improve outcomes in this rare malignancy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kabarriti R, Lloyd S, Jabalee J, Gay LM, Slater T, Guzman K, Jacobs C, Inocencio S, Lin R, Nguyen C, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18010035'&gt;10.3390/cancers18010035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41514548/'&gt;41514548&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Surveillance for anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC) recurrence relies on clinical examination and imaging. Post-treatment edema, fibrosis, and inflammation can result in clinically indeterminate findings (CIFs) that delay diagnosis and increase patient and system burden. Circulating tumor tissue-modified viral (TTMV)-HPV DNA offers a biologically specific, noninvasive biomarker that may clarify equivocal assessments. METHODS: In this multi-center retrospective study, 233 patients with HPV-associated ASCC were evaluated, including 185 with ≥1 post-treatment TTMV-HPV DNA test. CIFs were defined as exams or imaging results not definitively positive or negative for disease, and were paired with subsequent TTMV-HPV DNA tests. Concordance was defined by prespecified follow-up windows comparing TTMV-HPV DNA results with subsequent clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Ninety patients (39%) experienced 214 CIFs, arising from exams (46%, 98) or imaging (54%, 116). Indeterminate rates by assessment were 7% for exams, 17% for imaging, and 1.3% for TTMV-HPV DNA testing. Overall, 52 CIF/TTMV-HPV DNA pairs were eligible for analysis, and TTMV-HPV DNA resolved disease status accurately for 48/52 (92%, 95% CI: 81.5-97.9). Negative tests predicted cancer-free status for 37/41 CIFs (90%), while 100% of positive tests (11/11) were concordant with clinically confirmed recurrence. In 73% of positive cases (8/11), TTMV-HPV DNA was the first indication of recurrence (median lead-time 29 days; IQR 25-147). CONCLUSIONS: TTMV-HPV DNA testing reliably clarifies clinically indeterminate findings during ASCC surveillance, demonstrating high accuracy (92%) and earlier detection of recurrence. These data support integration into post-treatment management to reduce diagnostic uncertainty and guide timely care.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tarun MTI, Ebrahim HY, El Sayed KA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18010026'&gt;10.3390/cancers18010026&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41514539/'&gt;41514539&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background/Objectives. Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality among men in the United States. Treatment with second-generation androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors, such as enzalutamide, can trigger lineage plasticity, promoting the transdifferentiation of PCa cells into an AR-independent, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC). The receptor tyrosine kinase EPHA3 is a critical driver for NEPC. It is overexpressed in PCa, particularly in androgen-independent and neuroendocrine subtypes. EPHA3 activates c-Myc signaling to enhance EZH2 expression, promoting histone H3K27 trimethylation. The neural transcription factor BRN2 functions upstream of both EZH2 and ASCL1. The latter regulates the Notch pathway ligand DLL3, thereby orchestrating neuroendocrine differentiation. Elevated expression of classical neuroendocrine markers CHGA and SYP is characteristic of the NEPC phenotype. This study reports the novel usage of the olive phenolic S-(-)-hydroxyoleocanthal (HOC, oleacein) to effectively control NEPC by targeting the EPHA3-BRN2-EZH2-ASCL1-DLL3-SYP-CHGA oncogenic network. Methods. Cell viability assays were conducted to assess in vitro effects. To model NEPC progression and recurrence, NCI-H660-Luc cells were xenografted into male athymic nude mice. RNA-sequencing was performed to compare the differentially expressed genes between placebo control and treated tumors. Results. HOC significantly attenuated the proliferation of NEPC NCI-H660 cells in vitro. Daily oral administration of HOC at 10 mg/kg body weight markedly suppressed the progression of NEPC NCI-H660-Luc tumors. Continued HOC treatments after surgical excision of the primary tumors substantially reduced locoregional recurrence. HOC significantly downregulated the expression of EPHA3, BRN2, EZH2, ASCL1, DLL3, SYP, and CHGA in treated primary and recurrence tumors versus placebo control. Conclusions. These findings establish HOC as a multifaceted therapeutic entity capable of disrupting key NEPC oncogenic networks, highlighting its potential as a novel lead intervention for aggressive NEPC.</description>

To our knowledge, no prior analysis has examined CVRFs among C-AYAs &lt; 20 years old or compared CVRFs among younger and older C-AYAs. Methods: In this single-center study, individuals diagnosed with cancer at ≤39 years, treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (2010-2023), and with a post-treatment lipid panel and ≥2 post-treatment ambulatory blood pressure measurements were included. The CVRF prevalence was assessed among C-AYAs &lt; 20 and ≥20 years old, using age-appropriate AAP and ACC/AHA guidelines. These prevalences were compared with the ICD-9/10 code prevalence. The prescription of medications with antihypertensive effects (MAHEs) and lipid-lowering therapy was assessed. Results: Among 276 C-AYAs, the median age was 28.1 years (IQR 18.1-38.3) at dyslipidemia screening and 29.3 (IQR 20.0-38.7) at hypertension screening. Dyslipidemia was present in 52.9% (146/276) and hypertension in 56.2% (155/276) of C-AYAs. C-AYAs &lt; 20 years old had a high prevalence of dyslipidemia, 51.7% (45/87), and hypertension, 31.9% (29/91). CVRFs were frequently underdiagnosed, particularly dyslipidemia, among C-AYAs &lt; 20 years old, with only 12.6% (11/87) having a diagnosis via the ICD code. C-AYAs &lt; 20 years old with diagnoses of dyslipidemia and hypertension were significantly less likely to receive lipid-lowering therapy (2.2% vs. 14.9%) and trended toward less MAHEs (13.8% vs. 31.0%) compared to C-AYAs ≥ 20. Conclusions: Among C-AYAs treated with anthracyclines, dyslipidemia and hypertension were highly prevalent even at a young age (&lt;20 years). Younger survivors with dyslipidemia and hypertension were less frequently prescribed lipid-lowering therapy or MAHEs.</description>

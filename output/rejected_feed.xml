      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Schermerhorn SMV, Vore E, Bondoc AJ, Lautz TB, Ayala SA, Kastenberg ZJ, Arkin C, Malek MM, Campwala I, Aldrink JH, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70274'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70274&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41653066/'&gt;41653066&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is a critical staging tool in skin and soft tissue cancers. Although technetium lymphoscintigraphy is the most common adjunct, indocyanine green (ICG) demonstrates a promising alternative in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) skin and soft tissue cancers. METHODS AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICG in SLN biopsy (SLNB) in diverse pediatric and AYA solid cancers in a multi-institutional environment. This is a prospective, observational study conducted at 13 member institutions in the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative between 2019 and 2023. Eligible patients underwent SLNB for primary or recurrent solid skin and soft tissue tumors. Peritumoral ICG was administered intraoperatively. Outcomes included SLN detection rates, histopathology of excised specimens, and surgeon-reported assessment of utility. Safety was assessed through adverse event reporting. RESULTS: Forty SLNB procedures yielded 84 specimens: 13 melanoma (32.5%), 12 squamous cell carcinoma (30%), 11 non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (27.5%), two rhabdomyosarcoma (5%), one Ewing sarcoma (2.5%), and one malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2.5%). Histologic evaluation identified 81 lymph nodes, 75 benign (89.3%) and six malignant (7.1%); three specimens were adipose tissue (3.6%). Of 81 lymph nodes, 76% were ICG-positive. ICG had a sensitivity of 79.5%, a specificity of 33%, and a positive predictive value of 96%. All malignant nodes were ICG-avid. There were no adverse reactions to ICG at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: ICG is a safe and effective adjunct for SLNB in pediatric and AYA soft tissue and skin malignancies.</description>

Here, we report the discovery of a series of ZIKV NS3 protease inhibitors identified through phenotypic high-throughput screening (HTS) using a ZIKV replicon-based cellular assay, and the subsequent selection of resistant mutants. These inhibitors, characterized by the presence of an N-acylsydnone imine group, bind to a previously undescribed allosteric pocket of the protease, locking the enzyme into a catalytically inactive conformation. We describe the characterization of IRBM-Z-1, our initial allosteric hit and IRBM-Z-2, a potent inhibitor of ZIKV infectivity and other orthoflavivirus proteases with a favourable in vitro and in vivo ADME profile, resulting in oral efficacy against ZIKV infection in mouse models, with potential as a prophylactic agent for human use.</description>

This study proposes a linearly coupled two-compartment PK model, where the coupling term is defined as a linear function of another drug's amount to strike a balance between model simplicity and physiological interpretability. The model introduces parameter heterogeneity and linear interaction terms based on the classical compartmental structure, more accurately capturing concentration-dependent dynamic changes during combined drug administration. To address the model's nonlinear characteristics and high-dimensional parameters, a hierarchical optimization numerical solution algorithm was developed, enhancing computational efficiency while validating robustness against Gaussian noise. Through systematic analysis of key PK metrics ([Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], AUC, and [Formula: see text]), the study reveals the mechanisms by which absorption and clearance parameter variations influence drug distribution in vivo. Combining numerical simulations, parameter ablation experiments, and real-world data validation, the full model (retaining all linear interaction terms) outperforms the simplified model in both goodness-of-fit and information criteria, demonstrating superior interpretability and predictive performance. Overall, this model offers an intermediate solution between traditional compartmental models and PBPK models, providing a novel methodological framework for quantitative research on drug-drug interactions.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Renne A, Heaton J, Boahene KD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70417'&gt;10.1002/lary.70417&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41665481/'&gt;41665481&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Conventional grading scales and static image assessments may not capture dynamic facial movement in facial paralysis. We developed a video-based, dynamic, artificial intelligence (AI) application, DynaFace, to objectively quantify facial metrics and determine which measures correspond with patient-reported appearance, function, and psychosocial outcomes, providing insight into how objective dynamics relate to subjective patient experience. METHODS: DynaFace automatically extracted dynamic facial metrics (facial asymmetry index [FAI], bilateral palpebral fissure, and oral commissure excursion [OCE]) at rest and during smile, laughter, and pucker. Multivariable linear regression, controlling for paralysis duration and baseline trait emotional intelligence, assessed associations between objective metrics and patient-reported outcomes from FACE-Q subsets. RESULTS: Greater asymmetry (higher FAI) during smile and laugh was associated with poorer perceived facial (β = smile: -2.82/laugh: -3.01, p &lt; 0.05), eye (β = -3.99/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05), and smile appearance (β = -4.40/-4.80, p &lt; 0.01), as well as lower overall facial function (β = -3.05/-3.60, p &lt; 0.05) and self-esteem (β = -2.93/-3.12, p &lt; 0.05). In contrast, greater ratio of OCE change (affected to unaffected hemiface) during smile predicted better perceived facial appearance (β = 0.88, p &lt; 0.01), smile appearance (β = 0.69, p &lt; 0.05), and higher self-esteem (β = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05). Greater ratio of OCE change during both smile and laugh predicted improved social function (β = 0.48/0.44, p &lt; 0.05). Palpebral fissure asymmetry was associated with only eye appearance. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic AI-derived facial metrics from DynaFace align with patient perceptions, showing that greater symmetry in movement enhance satisfaction and function. These findings highlight the clinical potential of DynaFace to bridge objective and patient-reported measures in facial paralysis assessment.</description>

The present study was aimed to develop a Flow cytometry- based Florescence In situ hybridization (Flow-FISH) assay for simultaneous detection of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts at single-cell level. A set of 48 STAT3 multi locus probes and 18 HPV16 E6E7 probes were designed using Stellaris Probe Designer. Fluorescence microscopy using these probe sets generated discrete punctate signals for both individual and simultaneous hybridizations, enabling accurate transcript identification. Flow-cytometry analysis showed quantifiable STAT3 expression across CaCx cell lines, namely HeLa, SiHa and C33a. However, HPV16 E6E7 probes showed non-specific binding, which was addressed by redesigning the probes with increased stringency. The specificity of both probe sets was then evaluated through extensive sequence alignment against all known STAT3 transcript variants (n = 27) and 98 HPV16 isolates. The redesigned phase 2 HPV16 E6E7 probes were subsequently tested in cell lines, demonstrating robust detection in HPV16-positive SiHa and CaSki cells and complete absence of signal in HPV-negative controls (C33a, MSB1, SF21) or HPV18-positive HeLa cells. Dual-color flow cytometry enabled simultaneous quantification of STAT3 and HPV16 E6E7 transcripts in both cell lines and patient's exfoliated samples. Increased dual-positive fractions across LSIL, HSIL, and SCC samples were detected that corresponded with progressive viral oncogene activity and STAT3 co-activation. Overall, the optimized probe-based Flow-FISH assay provided a sensitive, specific, and high-throughput method for transcript-level diagnostics, with potential utility for stratifying cervical lesions.</description>

Understanding HDAC activation mechanisms is crucial to treating diverse diseases beyond cancer. Our study reveals that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6 or phytic acid), enriched in vegan diets, play essential roles in activating the HDAC3 epigenetic axis and maintaining intestinal barrier integrity. IPMK binds to HDAC3 and drives InsP6 synthesis, which selectively activates HDAC3 at a 10 nM concentration by recruiting the DAD domain of its corepressor protein. IPMK deletion diminishes HDAC3 activation, leading to histone hyperacetylation and MMP gene transcription that compromise intestinal barrier integrity. InsP6 treatment is sufficient to rescue these effects. In inflammatory bowel disease, diminished IPMK levels exacerbate intestinal permeability, while oral InsP6 treatment mitigates leaky gut effects by restoring the HDAC3 epigenetic axis, highlighting the clinical significance of the IPMK-HDAC3 pathway and the therapeutic potential of phytic acid.</description>

Automatic approaches exist but lack generalizability due to signal variability across centers. We develop an automatic apneic breathing event detector to localize and classify obstructive apneas, central apneas, hypopneas, and isolated respiratory events without arousals or desaturations. The model is trained on 5456 polysomnographies and tested on 1099 polysomnographies from six cohorts uses an end-to-end deep learning architecture. The model's predictions show a strong correlation with expert annotations for apnea-hypopnea index (r² = 0.84) and achieve an F1 score of 0.78 across apnea event types, with specific F1 scores of 0.71, 0.51, and 0.65 for obstructive apnea, central apnea, and hypopnea events, respectively. In two independent, multi-scored datasets, The model performs comparably or better than individual expert raters. The model's probabilistic output, termed "apnotyping," provides insights into sleep disordered breathing etiology, with event probabilities correlating more strongly with key sleep apnea traits-such as loop gain and pharyngeal muscle compensation-than traditional apnea indexes. This probabilistic approach may enhance diagnostic accuracy and support personalized treatment strategies, leading to improved patient outcomes.</description>

Global and national strategies highlight the importance of assessing and improving nursing competence. Despite the critical role of nurses, research on self-reported nursing competence (SRNC) in Jordan remains limited. AIM: This study explores self-reported nursing competence (SRNC) among registered nurses (RNs) in Jordan. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 212 RNs from public, private, and teaching hospitals. Data were collected using the short form of the Nursing Professional Competence (NPC) scale, a 35-item instrument scored on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very low competence) to 7 (very high competence), with higher scores indicating greater perceived professional competence. The derived data was analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: The overall level of self-reported nursing competence was high, with a mean score of 76.69%. Among these six domains, the domain of "documentation and administration of care" scored the highest (78.26%), and "care pedagogy" scored the lowest (75.23%). The items that scored high included "respectful communication," "clinical follow-up," and "documentation," which scored "to a high degree." The items that scored lower included "psychological needs," "group-based education," and "respect for different values," which scored "to a fairly high degree.".". CONCLUSIONS: The Jordanian nursing community views itself as very competent; however, improvements are needed in particular fields. Continuous learning and training are required in order to retain and upgrade professional competency. The findings highlight the value of mentorship, a supportive work environment, and continuing education. Future research should include peer and supervisor evaluations to validate self-reported competence and better guide workforce development strategies.</description>

Less is known about the involvement of other immune pathways and the potential role of other HDM proteins in allergic disease. In this study, the association between HDM allergy and immune responses to the HDM proteome was investigated. METHODS: The HDM proteome was represented by 40 purified recombinant HDM proteins (19 known allergens and 21 novel proteins). T-cell responses to HDM proteins were determined ex vivo and antibody responses (IgA, IgE, IgG and IgG4) were measured using micro arrays and basophil activation in 21 HDM allergic donors and 16 non-allergic controls. Changes in specific IgE, IgG and IgG4 during SQ HDM SLIT-Tablet immunotherapy was assessed in 38 subjects with allergic asthma. RESULTS: HDM proteins were broadly immunogenic inducing comparable IgG, IgA, and non-TH2 cytokine responses in both allergic and non-allergic individuals. Specific IgE, IgG4 and TH2 cytokine responses were largely restricted to the allergic donors. IgE and IgG4 were primarily directed to known major allergens and overlapping in specificity whereas cellular TH2 responses extended beyond the known HDM allergens. Individual proteins displayed distinct immunological profiles. HDM sublingual immunotherapy increased the levels of specific IgE and IgG4 but did not change the overall pattern of recognition. CONCLUSION: HDM proteins are highly immunogenic and give rise to complex patterns of immune recognition also in the absence of allergy. This has potential implications for the pathogenesis of HDM allergy and the mode of action of allergy immunotherapy.</description>

Women are also invited at age 45, 55 and 65 years if they did not test HPV-negative 5 years earlier (risk-based invitation). With influx of birth cohorts vaccinated against HPV, de-intensification may be needed to maintain a cost-effective program. We used an updated and recalibrated model of type-specific HPV transmission and cervical carcinogenesis to estimate the cost-effectiveness of 16 strategies with reduced screening intensity. Strategies varied by starting age, screening interval, and number of risk-based invitations, possibly stratified for HPV vaccination status. Cost-effectiveness was measured by net monetary benefit (NMB). A positive NMB indicates that a strategy is cost-effective compared to the current policy. Two strategies without stratification for HPV vaccination status had a positive NMB. An NMB of EUR 1.6 million per 100,000 women was obtained when, compared to current screening, the invitation at age 35 was based on the HPV-test result at age 30. An NMB of EUR 1.8 million per 100,000 women was obtained when women were re-invited every 5 years if they were HPV-positive or had not been tested 5 years earlier. If reduced screening was only applied to vaccinated women, the highest NMB was EUR 1.3 million per 100,000 women. Thus, reducing screening in HPV-vaccinated cohorts is cost-effective when re-inviting women after 10 years if they test HPV-negative. Stratification for HPV vaccination status does not improve the cost-effectiveness of screening.</description>

While recent studies have improved our understanding of PrEP use among pregnant and breastfeeding women, further evidence is needed to inform the design of interventions that support sustained use, especially among young women who are pregnant or parenting. METHODS: We analysed data from young women aged 15-29 years who initiated PrEP in an implementation study (FastPrEP) in Cape Town, South Africa. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between pregnancy or parenting status (≥ 1 living child) and PrEP discontinuation at 1- and 4-months post-initiation, based on pharmacy refill data. The primary exposure was currently pregnant or having a child (vs. not); secondary analyses stratified by age (15-24 vs. 25-29 years) among women who were pregnant/parenting. Models were adjusted for age and hypothesised explanatory factors were included in sensitivity analysis: service delivery location, contraceptive use, HIV risk perception, and relationship status. RESULTS: Between August 2022 and June 2024 n = 4,876 young women initiated PrEP; 44% were pregnant/parenting (of which 10% were pregnant), and the median age was 21.6 years (IQR:18-25). At 1-month, women who were pregnant/parenting had higher odds of PrEP discontinuation (aOR:1.30, 95% CI:1.14-1.49). At 4-months this relationship persisted (aOR:1.41, 95% CI:1.12-1.78) compared with non-pregnant/parenting women. Among those pregnant/parenting, younger women (15-24 years) had higher odds of discontinuation at 1-month (aOR:1.31, 95% CI:1.08-1.58) and 4-months (aOR:1.41, 95%CI:1.02-1.96) compared to women aged 25-29. In the fully adjusted multivariable model, receiving PrEP in mobile clinics (aOR:0.71, 95% CI:0.61-0.82) vs. government clinics was associated with lower odds of early discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Young women who are pregnant/parenting face elevated risk of early PrEP discontinuation. Differentiated, life-stage and youth-responsive interventions, such as counselling, partner involvement, and integration with maternal and child health, or sexual and reproductive health services, are critical to improving PrEP persistence among this priority population. This population should be prioritised in the rollout of long-acting PrEP formulations, which may better align with their needs and reduce the burden of daily adherence.</description>

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 209 ESCC patients treated with nCRT. PV substructures (LSPV, LIPV, RSPV, RIPV) were contoured on radiotherapy planning scans, and dose-volume histogram parameters were extracted. AF events were ascertained through systematic cardiac monitoring. Multivariate competing risk regression was employed to assess associations between PV doses and AF, with adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, surgical resection as a time-dependent covariate, and mortality as a competing risk. RESULTS: Among 209 patients (84.9% male; median age 66 years), the 2-year cumulative incidence of AF was 8.89%, with a median time to AF of 13 months. Among the 25 AF events, 15 (60%) occurred after esophagectomy, with a median time from surgery to AF of 2.1 months. On univariate analysis, age, hypertension, LIPV-∼Dmax∼, RSPV-∼Dmax∼, and coronary heart disease (CHD) were associated with AF. In the multivariable model, LIPV-∼Dmax remained an independent predictor (adjusted HR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.19-8.42, p = 0.021) after adjustment for age (HR = 3.66, p = 0.009), CHD (HR = 2.59, p = 0.019), and surgical resection. Patients with LIPV-∼Dmax∼ &gt;28.87 Gy had a significantly higher AF incidence (12.3%) than those below this threshold (p = 0.008). Moreover, AF was associated with inferior 2-year recurrence-free survival (36.9% vs. 78.6%, p = 0.0051) and inferior 2-year overall survival (58.3% vs. 82.1%, p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: Maximum dose to the LIPV was independently associated with increased AF risk and worse survival outcomes in ESCC patients receiving nCRT. These results highlighted the potential value of LIPV-sparing radiotherapy techniques and enhanced AF surveillance in this population. External validation in larger prospective cohorts was needed before firm clinical guidelines can be established.</description>

In this prospective, multi-center, single-arm phase II trial (NCT03154983), patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2, day 1) and S-1 (body surface area-based dosing, days 1-14) every 3 weeks, plus daily apatinib (500 mg), for up to 6 planned cycles. 45 patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up time of 12.4 months. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 7.6 months (95% CI: 5.8%-9.4%) and 12.4 months (95% CI: 9.3%-15.5%), respectively in the full analysis set. Patients completing ≥4 cycles achieved a better mOS of 14.5 months (95% CI: 12.0%-17.1%). The objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were 62.2% (95% CI, 46.5%-76.2%) and 82.2% (95% CI, 67.9%-92.0%), respectively, including one complete response (CR). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 48.9% of patients, most commonly oral mucositis and neutropenia. These findings support apatinib plus DS as a promising biomarker-independent first-line treatment strategy for mGC.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, a total of 60 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled. Thirty patients who had been treated with metformin and subsequently received dapagliflozin in addition to metformin during doxorubicin therapy constituted the dapagliflozin group. The non-dapagliflozin group consisted of 30 patients who, while continuing metformin, were initiated on another oral antidiabetic agent (excluding dapagliflozin) alongside doxorubicin therapy. N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) were measured at baseline and at the 3rd month of treatment. Between-group baseline characteristics were compared using the independent samples t-test for continuous variables. Within-group changes from baseline to 3 months were analyzed with paired t-tests. Between-group comparisons of 3-month outcomes and changes (ΔLVEF, ΔLVGLS, ΔNT-proBNP) were also conducted using independent samples t-tests. To evaluate the independent effect of dapagliflozin on LVGLS, multivariable linear regression analysis was performed. Model fit was reported with adjusted R², F-statistics and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: In the non-dapagliflozin group, LVEF and NT-proBNP levels showed no significant differences between baseline and post-treatment; however, LVGLS values significantly deteriorated. In contrast, the dapagliflozin group demonstrated a significant increase in LVEF (- 2.000 [95% CI - 2.392, - 1.608]) and LVGLS (+ 1.367 [95% CI + 1.159, + 1.574]), as well as a marked reduction in NT-proBNP levels (+ 64.933 [95% CI + 57.902, + 71.964]) after 3 months of treatment (p &lt; 0.001). At the third month, the dapagliflozin group exhibited significantly better LVGLS (+ 2.133 [95% CI + 1.346, + 2.921]) and lower NT-proBNP levels (+ 57.000 [95% CI + 28.302, + 85.698]) compared with the non-dapagliflozin group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable linear regression analysis confirmed that dapagliflozin use was independently associated with significant improvement in LVGLS at 3 months. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, dapagliflozin was associated with more favorable short-term surrogate changes in LVGLS and NT-proBNP during doxorubicin therapy. The favorable changes observed in LVEF, LVGLS, and NT-proBNP parameters suggest that dapagliflozin may be considered a potential cardioprotective agent and incorporated into preventive strategies against chemotherapy-related cardiotoxicity in diabetic patients. These hypothesis-generating findings require confirmation in larger randomized trials powered for clinical endpoints with longer follow-up. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not applicable.</description>

However, there have been no prior studies on using bacteriophages for peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This report presents the successful treatment of refractory peritonitis in a 71-year-old male peritoneal dialysis patient using bacteriophages combined with antibiotics. The patient has a history of refractory and repeat peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus, which was resolved through simultaneous catheter replacement (SCR). Subsequently, the patient experiences another episode of refractory peritonitis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although this strain is found to be susceptible to amikacin and imipenem, a 14-day course of treatment with these antibiotics in the abdominal cavity fails to resolve the peritonitis. Combined with antibiotic therapy, the patient is successfully treated with intraperitoneal phage therapy targeting his bacterial isolate. We monitor the longitudinal progression of phage loads, phage-neutralizing antibodies, interleukin-6 levels, and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the dialysate effluent during the bacteriophage therapy. The combination of a phage cocktail and imipenem (IPM) demonstrates a greater effect in killing bacteria than either treatment alone, which indicates that a synergistic effect exists between the phage cocktail and IPM. Intraperitoneal IPM is discontinued after a 3-week course of treatment. At the same time, oral fluconazole is given to prevent fungal infections. The patient is discharged without any antibiotics. After this round of treatment, the patient remains healthy during the one-month follow-up. Our study suggests that personalized phage therapy combined with sensitive antibiotics can play a significant role in managing refractory peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, showing promise for future applications.</description>

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of switching to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) from bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with HIV-1. METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, controlled, double-blind, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 49 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in six countries: Australia, Chile, Israel, Japan, the UK, and the USA. Adults aged 18 years or older with HIV-1, who were virologically suppressed (with a viral load of HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies per mL) for at least 3 consecutive months on bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide and had no history of treatment failure or known resistance to doravirine, were eligible for the study. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule with a block size of three, to switch to oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) or to continue bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, once daily. Participants, investigators, study staff, and sponsor personnel were masked to study treatment; sponsor personnel directly involved in this analysis were unmasked at week 48. The primary endpoint, which was assessed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment, was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach; non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05630755, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17 and Nov 17, 2023, 585 individuals were screened, of whom 514 were randomly assigned and 513 treated: 342 participants were switched to doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) and 171 continued bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide. The median age of the 513 participants was 47 years (IQR 37-58), 403 (79%) were assigned male and 110 (21%) were assigned female at birth, 158 (31%) were Black or African American, and 117 (23%) were Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. At week 48, doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide (viral load ≥50 copies per mL in five [1·5%] of 342 vs one [0·6%] of 171 participants) with a treatment difference of 0·9% (multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -1·9 to 2·9). The rates of adverse events (74·6% [255 of 342 participants] vs 71·3% [122 of 171 participants]; difference 3·2 [95% CI -4·7 to 11·6]), treatment-related adverse events (10·2% [35] vs 9·4% [16]; 0·9 [-5·1 to 6·0]), serious adverse events (4·4% [15] vs 6·4% [11]; -2·0 [-7·1 to 1·9]), and discontinuations due to adverse events (2·9% [ten] vs 1·8% [three]; 1·2 [-2·3 to 3·9]) were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide group, and no deaths were reported. INTERPRETATION: The combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) has similar efficacy and safety profiles to bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide, and could provide a two-drug, once daily, oral single-tablet option without an integrase strand-transfer inhibitor for adults who are virologically suppressed and want to switch to a different ART regimen.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Orkin C, Mngqibisa R, Velez JD, Kumar P, Braun DL, Carr A, Bloch M, Walmsley S, Tebas P, Yokomaku Y, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01945-2'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01945-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41654374/'&gt;41654374&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Doravirine and islatravir is an investigational, once-daily, single-tablet regimen containing two potent antiretrovirals with complementary mechanisms of action and resistance profiles. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from stable, oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) to the fixed combination of doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) in virologically suppressed adults living with HIV-1. METHODS: This phase 3, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial was conducted at 53 research, community, and hospital-based clinics in eight countries: Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, South Africa, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA. Adults (aged ≥18 years) with a viral load of fewer than 50 copies of HIV-1 RNA per mL on any oral, two-drug or three-drug ART regimen for at least 3 months, with no history of treatment failure, known resistance to doravirine, or active hepatitis B infection, were randomly assigned (2:1) according to a computer-generated randomisation schedule (block size three) to receive oral doravirine (100 mg) and islatravir (0·25 mg) once daily or to continue baseline ART for 48 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by the anchor antiretroviral drug class (integrase strand-transfer inhibitor [INSTI], non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, or protease inhibitor) in the baseline regimen. The primary endpoint (assessed in all treated participants) was the percentage of participants with a viral load of 50 copies per mL or higher at week 48 (analysed according to the US Food and Drug Administration snapshot approach); non-inferiority would be concluded if the upper bound of the multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI for the treatment difference was less than 4%. The safety analysis population included all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05631093, and is ongoing but closed to enrolment. FINDINGS: Between Feb 20 and Oct 24, 2023, 614 individuals were screened for eligibility, of whom 553 were randomly assigned to receive doravirine and islatravir (n=368) or baseline ART (n=185). 551 participants received at least one dose of allocated medication: 366 in the doravirine and islatravir group and 185 in the baseline ART group. Of these 551 participants, 332 (60%) were assigned male and 219 (40%) were assigned female at birth, and the median age was 51 years (IQR 41-59); 250 (45%) identified as Black or African American and 80 (15%) identified as Hispanic, Latino, or Latina. Doravirine and islatravir showed non-inferiority at week 48, with viral loads of 50 copies per mL or higher in five (1·4%) of 366 participants versus nine (4·9%) of 185 participants on baseline ART (difference -3·6% [multiplicity-adjusted 95% CI -7·8 to -0·8]). Treatment-related adverse events were more common with doravirine and islatravir (44 [12·0%] of 366 participants) than with baseline ART (nine [4·9%] of 185 participants; difference 7·2 [95% CI 2·2 to 11·6]). Rates were similar in the doravirine and islatravir group and the baseline ART group for any adverse event (79·5% [291 of 366 participants] vs 83·8% [155 of 185 participants]; difference -4·3 [-10·7 to 2·8]), serious adverse events (6·3% [23] vs 4·9% [nine]; 1·4 [-3·2 to 5·2]), and discontinuation due to adverse events (0·5% [two] vs 2·2% [four]; -1·6 [-4·9 to 0·2]). One death occurred (in the baseline ART group) and was not considered treatment-related. No participants discontinued treatment as a result of protocol-specified declines in CD4 cell or total lymphocyte counts. INTERPRETATION: Doravirine and islatravir is efficacious and well tolerated and would represent the first non-INSTI-based, two-drug regimen for HIV-1 treatment. With increasing concern over the potential development of widespread INSTI resistance, this once-daily, oral, single-tablet regimen could be a potential option for people living with HIV-1 requiring a change to their antiretroviral regimen. The safety and efficacy findings support the ongoing development of islatravir, a drug with long-acting potential. FUNDING: Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, a subsidiary of Merck &amp; Co.</description>

This multicenter study aimed to compare characteristics of MSFB, MSFBO, and ODS. METHODS: A multicenter international retrospective cohort study was conducted on adults with MSFBs and ODS who underwent sinus surgery. First in MSFBs, it was determined whether different dental conditions were more likely in FB versus non-FB sides. Second, clinical features and dental pathologies were compared between MSFBO and ODS. For analyses, dental conditions were considered individually and as two groups: infectious pathologies and dental/oral procedures with indwelling metallic materials. RESULTS: After exclusions, there were 203 MSFBs and 163 ODS. Among MSFBs, 141 were MSFBOs. FB sides were associated with sinus protrusion of root canal treatment (RCT) materials (p = 0.040) and dental implants (p = 0.040). Compared to MSFBO, ODS patients were younger, more likely to have MS purulence (OR = 40.9, p &lt; 0.010), more likely associated with apical periodontitis (OR = 2.59, p = 0.010) and oroantral fistulas (OR = 6.94, p = 0.020), and less likely associated with extruded RCT materials (OR = 0.01, p = 0.010) and protruded midface screws (OR &lt; 0.01, p = 0.010). Comparing purulent MSFBO and ODS, ODS was more associated with infectious dental pathologies (p &lt; 0.009). CONCLUSION: Compared to MSFBs, MSFBOs were associated with RCT extrusion and implant protrusion. Compared to MSFBOs, ODS was more likely purulent and associated with infectious dental pathologies. While ODS is often distinct from MSFBO, the two conditions can coexist, and surgeons must determine whether patients have infectious dental pathology requiring treatment with both conditions.</description>

Standard approaches typically rely on real-time bronchoscopic or ultrasound guidance, which may be unavailable in resource-limited settings. We evaluated the feasibility, safety, and learning curve of landmark-guided PDT performed without adjunctive visualization. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 71 consecutive adult patients who underwent landmark-guided PDT without bronchoscopic or ultrasound guidance between August 2024 and June 2025. All procedures were performed by a head and neck surgeon newly trained in PDT. Outcomes included procedure duration, complication rates, and patient-specific predictors of procedural difficulty. The learning curve was assessed using correlation and linear regression, and independent predictors of prolonged procedure time were identified through multivariable linear modeling. RESULTS: The median procedure time was 7.0 (3.0-54.0) min, and a significant learning curve was observed (r = -0.41; p &lt; 0.001). Complications occurred in 14.1% of patients, with major events being limited to one bleeding episode and two pneumothoraces. In multivariable analyses, prior cerebrovascular accident and increased cricoid-manubrium distance independently predicted prolonged procedure times. CONCLUSION: Landmark-guided PDT without real-time visualization was feasible and safe following a brief learning phase. With appropriate patient selection and operator training, this technique may represent a practical alternative in settings where visualization adjuncts are unavailable.</description>

The optimal triage of HPV-positive women could be a combination of cytology triage with HPV genotyping or p16/Ki67 staining. We report number of screen positives, colposcopies, and cervical lesions of three different triage algorithms (p16/Ki67, HPV16/18, or HPV16/18/31/33/52) in HPV-positive women with low-grade cytological abnormalities. We included 178,317 women with a sample in 2021 of which 91,517 were screened with HPV and 86,800 with cytology. All women were followed for 18 months. Almost three times as many women screened positive with HPV-based screening compared to cytology-based screening (RR 2.99, 95% 2.93-3.05) and colposcopies derived from the screening program were also more common (RR 1.68, 95% 1.63-1.73). p16/Ki67 triage resulted in more colposcopies (RR 1.86, 95% 1.76-1.95) than HPV16/18 (RR 1.54, 95% 1.44-1.65) and HPV16/18/31/33/52 (RR 1.63, 95% 1.55-1.71). The excess in colposcopy referrals was reduced when non-screening-derived colposcopies were included (intention-to-treat). Nevertheless, more women with CIN2 or worse were detected in the HPV group than in the cytology group per screened woman; in the p16/Ki67 triage group (RR 1.65, 95% 1.54-1.77), in the HPV16/18 group (RR 1.36, 95% 1.23-1.50), and in the HPV16/18/31/33/52 group (RR 1.48, 95% 1.37-1.59). HPV-based screening, as compared with cytology screening, resulted in more screen positives, but all three triage algorithms substantially reduced the excess number of referrals to colposcopy. p16/Ki67 compared to triage with HPV16/18 may detect more cervical lesions.</description>

In addition, it was originally described as having minimal bone stock making dental rehabilitation with dental implants very difficult. METHODS: Retrospective review from 2015 to 2025 of patients that underwent segmental resections involving the maxillofacial complex and received scapula free tissue transfer with dental implants. Contributing surgeons are affiliated with the following institutions: Northwell Health (Northwell Cancer Institute), University of Pittsburgh, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the Medical University of South Carolina. RESULTS: Eighty-seven dental implants were placed in 29 patients mainly using the angular branch of the thoracodorsal artery. Fifteen patients (51.7%) had their implants placed during the initial ablative and scapular reconstruction. The median number of dental implants placed in each scapula was two, and overall implant osseointegration was 88.8% after following patients on average for 41 months. CONCLUSION: Our multi-institution review has demonstrated that the scapula free flap has adequate bone quantity to support immediate and delayed dental implants to provide long term success for dental rehabilitation. We recognize that the sample size in this series is relatively small; however, this series represents one of the largest in the current literature.</description>

The risk associated with modern mediastinal RT in pediatric cHL is unknown. METHODS: We modeled the risk of SMN in children with cHL who enrolled in the multi-institutional Children's Oncology Group AHOD1331 trial (2015-2019) and received mediastinal RT. FINDINGS: Among 587 trial patients, 296 (50%) received mediastinal RT and were eligible for this analysis. Proton therapy was used for 25%, photon intensity modulated RT (IMRT) for 46%, and photon 3-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT) for 28%. The RT prescription dose was 21 Gy in 83% and 30 Gy in 16%. The estimated mean lifetime attributable risk at 70 years of age of breast carcinoma (females) was 2.92% (1.45% proton; 4.36% IMRT; 1.82% 3D-CRT; p&lt;0.0001), lung carcinoma was 5.37% (4.15% proton; 6.24% IMRT; 5.07% 3D-CRT; p&lt;0.0001), and thyroid carcinoma was 0.17% (0.25% proton; 0.17% IMRT; 0.12% 3D-CRT; p=0.271). The predicted risk of breast carcinoma was higher among female patients treated with their arms raised versus arms down (p&lt;0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Normal tissue doses associated with contemporary mediastinal RT produce lower predicted SMN risks than were observed in cohorts treated with historical RT approaches, with substantial variation among individuals. On average, proton therapy is associated with a lower predicted risk. These findings have implications for the selection of therapies, counseling of patients, planning of RT, and recommendations for SMN screening.</description>

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 202 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid cancer who completed the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire. Sociodemographic and clinical data such as age, sex, educational status, employment, tumor size, ATA risk classification, TNM stage, and radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy were recorded. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics, non-parametric tests, Spearman correlation, and multivariable linear regression to determine predictors of global HRQoL score. RESULTS: The median global HRQoL was 58.3 (IQR: 50.0-75.0). Functional scores were highest in role, emotional, cognitive, and social domains (median 66.7). Fatigue was the most prominent symptom (median: 44.4), followed by pain, dyspnea, and insomnia (each 33.3). Female sex, lower educational level, and higher RAI dose were associated with lower global HRQoL scores. Emotional functioning was significantly lower in patients aged ≥ 55 years. Multivariable regression analysis identified sex, education level, RAI dose, and TNM stage as significant predictors of HRQoL. CONCLUSION: Despite generally favorable prognoses in DTC, multiple demographic and treatment-related variables significantly influence patient-reported HRQoL. RAI therapy and disease stage may impact HRQoL less than previously assumed. These findings highlight the importance of individualized supportive care strategies in survivorship plans.</description>

This study investigated the clinical features of tumors that were missed during endoscopic examinations. AIM: To investigate and analyze the endoscopic and clinical features of missed anal and anorectal tumors. METHODS: All patients diagnosed with anal and anorectal tumors between 2014 and 2024 at West China Hospital were included in this retrospective cohort analysis. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, endoscopic findings, and missed diagnosis records were extracted from electronic medical records and telephone follow-up. A descriptive and error-classification analysis was performed to identify the reasons for missed diagnoses during endoscopy. RESULTS: Descriptive and error-classification analysis among the 83 enrolled patients, 10 (7 with adenocarcinoma and 3 with squamous cell carcinoma) had undergone previous endoscopic examinations with negative diagnoses, resulting in a missed detection proportion of 12.0%. Six missed cases with 15 prior colonoscopies in which the lesions were overlooked had complete medical records. The mean number of endoscopic procedures performed prior to the definitive diagnosis was 2.5 (range: 1-5), with an average diagnostic delay of 43.4 months (range: 1-82). The causes of missed diagnoses included exposure errors (n = 8), judgment errors (n = 6), and biopsy errors (n = 1). The proportion of endoscopic rectal retroflexion to observe anus was 20% . CONCLUSION: The missed diagnosis proportion of anal and anorectal tumors was high during endoscopic examination. Comprehensive endoscopic observation and enhanced recognition of the endoscopic features of anal tumors are essential.</description>

Here, we report a montmorillonite-based oral fermentation system (MOFS) that achieves long-lasting in-situ preparation of beneficial bioproducts for intestinal homeostasis restoration. MOFS is fabricated by loading metabolic substrates in the lamellar structure of montmorillonite via cation replacement and adsorbing the substrate-related bacteria through electrostatic interactions. The water-impermeable property and mucoadhesive ability of montmorillonite endow MOFS with high oral availability and extended retention in the gut. The continuous release of loaded substrates and the formation of biofilms by carried bacteria enable long-term yet efficient synthesis of beneficial metabolites in the intestine, which comprehensively improve gut microbiota composition, suppress intestinal inflammation, and increase the integrity of the gut barrier. In murine models of imbalanced intestinal homeostasis, MOFS demonstrates superior efficacies by alleviating the associated symptoms, even in comparison to clinical therapeutics.</description>

While its colonization usually begins at birth, the extent of maternal involvement in yeast transmission to their offspring, particularly across different racial groups, remains unclear. Studies have shown elevated levels of C. albicans in both mothers and children, with genetically related fungal strains, suggesting maternal transmission, but the racial component, notably higher levels in Black children, lacks thorough investigation of underlying factors. Our research aimed to address this gap by investigating how maternal and demographic factors such as socioeconomic status and oral health affect C. albicans levels in infants across Black and non-Black populations. Employing a partial linear semiparametric mixed-effects model (PLSMM) with variable selection and race-based stratification, we identified predictors that have different effects depending on the infant's race among a large pool of predictors. Through this stratified analysis, we aimed to discern crucial factors significantly contributing to C. albicans colonization while minimizing the impact of irrelevant or redundant variables. In this stratified analysis, exclusive breastfeeding ([Formula: see text]) and maternal marriage ([Formula: see text]) were significant predictors among non-Black infants, while maternal employment ([Formula: see text]) and post-delivery maternal C. albicans ([Formula: see text]) were significant among Black infants. Our findings highlighted race-specific associations between C. albicans levels in children and factors such as breastfeeding practices, marital status, maternal oral hygiene, and maternal C. albicans levels. Our study underscores the importance of race-specific considerations in understanding C. albicans colonization in infants, offering insights for tailored interventions and healthcare strategies, particularly for vulnerable populations.</description>

Despite growing attention to value integration in EFL materials, empirical studies on moral and value representation in oral English textbooks remain sparse, and learners' perspectives on value acquisition through oral instruction are underexplored-this study aims to address these gaps. The study employed a mixed-methods approach: the researcher systematically analyzed 318 pages of New Inside Out Book 1 and Book 2 (first-year college EFL oral English textbooks), screening all module types including vocabulary, grammar, dialogue, listening, reading, writing, and exercise for value-related content, which was then coded and recorded in Excel. Frequency statistics show the sample textbooks include 273 value-laden verbal text samples, with a Chi-Square Test revealing statistically significant differences in dimension emphasis between the two volumes. Within Martin and White's (2005) Language Appraisal Theory, qualitative textual analysis identifies the value significance of linguistic resources as a prominent feature across module types. Additionally, to gather learner feedback on the effectiveness of value education in the oral English course, an online questionnaire survey (via Wen Juan Xing platform) was administered to learners who used the selected EFL oral English textbooks for a whole academic year. The survey showed that values-based EFL instruction positively impacted morality and personal growth.</description>

In this study, we investigate the etiology and management of intraoperative flap loss. METHODS: Retrospective review between 2010 and 2024 at 6 institutions. RESULTS: There were 7423 free flaps performed with 46 instances of intraoperative flap failure (0.62%). The most common recipient subsite was oral cavity (27/46, 57%). Anterolateral thigh (ALT) was the most common flap type to fail (18/46, 39%), followed by the fibula (15/46, 32%). The most common reasons for total failure were clotting without observable vessel abnormality (12/35, 34.3%), poor quality perforator (11/35, 31.4%), and vessel spasm or intimal abnormality leading to clotting (8/35, 22.9%). The most common acute management was converting to an additional free flap intraoperatively (28/46, 60.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Flap failure intraoperatively is rare. The majority of cases were acutely managed with an additional flap to provide defect coverage.</description>

We sought to explore sponsorship opportunities by gender by investigating committee leadership, keynote speakership, and panelist-moderator ratios from prior American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) and Combined Otolaryngology Sections Meeting (COSM) conferences. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional review of publicly available program conferencing. SETTING: Literature review. METHODS: Gender breakdowns of committee leadership and keynote speakerships were recorded from official AAO-HNS conference programming from 2013 to 2021. Panelist-moderator gender ratios were calculated for the AAO-HNS conferences from 2023 to 2024. Society leadership representation and panelist-moderator gender ratios were also investigated from recent COSM conferences between 2018 and 2024 via official programming. RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2021, analyses of the AAO-HNS national conferences determined that women comprised on average of 29.6% of annual directorship roles (range 12.5-37.55), 35.6% of board member positions (26.3%-47.4%), and 25.2% of keynote speaker appointments (0%-40%). Between 2019 and 2023, in COSM, women held on average 23.3% of available society chair/secretary positions and 19.0% of society president roles. The ratio of female:total panelist was positively correlated with female moderators. CONCLUSION: Female representation in AAO-HNS and COSM leadership and keynote speakerships has improved over time in recent years, and appears to be on par with academic otolaryngology workforce composition. However, male moderators presenting panels at both conferences had significantly fewer female panelists versus female moderators. This difference in national panel participation opportunities may impact career advancement and national reputation for female otolaryngologists.</description>

We present the largest cohort to date evaluating the procedure's effectiveness and compare functional outcomes by etiology of BVFI. METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive patients treated at a tertiary care center from April 2014 to 2024. All patients who underwent TCMA for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) or bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) were included. Exclusion criteria were multi-level stenosis and prior airway resection or reconstruction. We assessed rate of decannulation, Voice handicap index (VHI), dyspnea index (DI), eating assessment tool (EAT-10), and cough severity index (CSI) scores and compared outcomes by surgical indication. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included and the majority had PGS (64%). Seventy six percent of tracheostomy dependent patients were decannulated. Surgical indication did not impact time to decannulation or number of interventions required for decannulation. DI was improved at 1-month post-operation and last clinic visit (p &lt; 0.0001). DI was slightly improved for the PGS cohort at last clinic visit, compared to the BVFP cohort (p = 0.04). There were no differences in VHI, EAT-10, or CSI after surgery compared with baseline, or differences based on BVFI etiology. CONCLUSIONS: TCMA is an effective surgical intervention for BVFI that provides a reliable rate of decannulation and improves respiratory function without compromising voice or swallowing outcomes, regardless of the BVFI etiology.</description>

Here, we develop PRISM, an efficient computational framework for precise microorganism identification and decontamination from low-biomass sequencing data. PRISM achieves robust performance when benchmarked on 230 independent datasets with known true-positive and contaminant taxa. We then use PRISM to profile 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. We identify consistent microbial signatures in gastrointestinal tract, head-and-neck, and urogenital tract tumors, and sparse signal elsewhere. In pancreatic cancer, we associate microbial detection with altered host protein glycosylation pathways and greater smoking exposure. Lastly, we consider the impact of sequencing approaches on positive and negative data interpretation. Overall, PRISM improves the reliability of microbial profiling and allows leveraging of existing human genomic data for the concurrent detection of host-microbial signatures with potential molecular and clinical significance.</description>

Although dMMR/MSI predicts response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in several cancers, their relevance in adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the MMR system and MSI in patients with apparently sporadic ACC and explored associations with clinical characteristics and outcomes. In a subgroup, correlation between dMMR/MSI and response to ICI was evaluated. Immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 was carried out in 109 ACC tissues with molecular data. Germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) and somatic oncogenic/likely oncogenic (O/LO) MMR variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. MLH1 methylation and EPCAM deletions were assessed via multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. MSI was analysed using plex PCR. RESULTS: dMMR was identified in 15 (14%) cases, mainly involving MSH6 loss (n = 9, 8.3%) either with MSH2 or alone. No significant differences were observed in hormone secretion, European Network for the Study of Adrenal Tumors (ENSAT) stage, proliferation index (Ki67%), S-GRAS (Stage, Grade, Resection status, Age, Symptoms) score, progression-free survival (8 versus 14 months) and overall survival (72 versus 80 months) between patients with and without dMMR. A slightly higher frequency of other malignancies was observed in dMMR cases (27% versus 11%, P = 0.09). Ten dMMR tumours were linked to P/LP germline (n = 4, 26.7%) or O/LO somatic (n = 5, 33.6%) MMR variants or MLH1 hypermethylation (n = 1, 6.7%), but only three (20%) showed MSI. Lynch syndrome was identified in 5% of patients. Among 12 patients treated with ICIs, time to progression was similar between those with and without defective MMR (4 versus 5 months, P = 0.21). Only one of five ICI responders had a confirmed MSH6 variant. CONCLUSION: DMMR occurs in a minority of ACC, often without MSI. Although Lynch syndrome accounts for a subset of cases, dMMR is not predictive of clinical features or ICI response. Nonetheless, MMR testing remains important for identifying individuals at hereditary cancer risk.</description>

In this study, we identify a distinct subset of autoimmune LTS characterized by edema of the inferior true vocal folds that extends to the superior aspect of the cricoid cartilage, termed "infracordal stenosis." The objective of this study is to characterize the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of infracordal stenosis and compare it to typical autoimmune-related subglottic stenosis (AI-SGS). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients with autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis evaluated by both rheumatology and otolaryngology at our institution to identify two groups: patients with infracordal stenosis and those with typical AI-SGS. Data on immunosuppressive treatments and airway dilation procedures were collected. Time to first dilation was compared between groups. RESULTS: Among 49 patients with autoimmune LTS, 11 had infracordal involvement. Six patients had isolated infracordal stenosis while five had concomitant subglottic involvement. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed longer time to first dilation in patients with infracordal involvement (median 792 vs. 44 days; p = 0.048). Four out of six patients with isolated infracordal stenosis required no dilations during their entire follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Among autoimmune LTS patients referred to rheumatology, those with infracordal involvement experienced longer time to first dilation compared to those with typical AI-SGS. These findings suggest that infracordal stenosis may represent a distinct, glucocorticoid-responsive phenotype within autoimmune laryngotracheal stenosis, with implications for treatment selection and multidisciplinary care.</description>

METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of children with cleft palate who were seen at a single academic center between August 2014 and April 2024 and underwent primary palatoplasty. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and the need for and number of secondary velopharyngeal surgeries were recorded. Univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify associated factors. RESULTS: Of 251 children who underwent primary palatoplasty, 27 (10.8%) required secondary velopharyngeal surgery. Univariate analyses revealed no association between secondary surgery and cleft type, presence of a syndrome, or timing of palatoplasty. Multivariate logistic regression controlling for race, insurance type, age at primary palatoplasty, and presence of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome revealed private insurance was associated with decreased odds of secondary velopharyngeal surgery (OR = 0.230, 95% CI: 0.069-0.765, p = 0.017), whereas Asian race was associated with increased odds (OR = 5.853, 95% CI: 1.105-30.998, p = 0.038). Among those requiring velopharyngeal surgery, 74.1% underwent one procedure and 25.9% underwent two. The presence of 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome was significantly associated with needing two surgeries (p = 0.042), while female sex was associated with requiring only one surgery (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and sociodemographic factors were predictive of secondary velopharyngeal surgery following primary palatoplasty, with different risk factors associated with the need for more than one procedure. Larger studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and guide risk stratification and family counseling.</description>

Oral HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is effective, but FSWs' PrEP use typically declines rapidly post-initiation in service settings. We examined a pilot individualized case management (ICM) intervention aiming to increase PrEP adherence and persistence among cisgender FSW initiating PrEP in eThekwini, South Africa. To assess pathways of intervention influence and potential effectiveness, we characterize the support participants received from the case manager (CM) and the ways in which it influenced their PrEP adherence and persistence. METHODS: FSW initiating PrEP through a non-governmental key populations program (n = 29) participated in the pilot ICM sessions for 12 weeks, as well as semi-structured, in-depth interviews (IDIs) at baseline, month 1, and month 3. We triangulated the IDIs with CM observation notes and PrEP program refill data through month 4. We coded textual data thematically, and produced narrative summaries and time-ordered matrices to summarize themes, assess changes over time, and compare participants who continued versus discontinued PrEP by month 4. We employed the "capability, opportunity, and motivation - behavior (COM-B)" system in interpreting the pathways through which the CM's support influenced participants' PrEP adherence and persistence and considering potential intervention enhancements. RESULTS: The CM provided emotional, instrumental, and informational support that positively influenced participants' PrEP use capability, opportunity, and motivation. She bolstered participants' PrEP use capability by providing reminder tools and information to manage side effects and dispel misunderstanding; opportunity by helping strategize covert PrEP use in the face of stigma, and directly resolving pill access problems stemming from mobility and housing insecurity; and motivation by providing care and accompaniment. Experiences of care, accompaniment, and other emotional support from the CM were deeply felt in context of sex work stigma, and more prominent in the narratives of participants continuing PrEP at month 4 (20/29; 69%) versus those who discontinued. Still, 31% (9/29) of participants discontinued PrEP, and key influential forms of CM support required her ongoing presence. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest both pathways of potential ICM effectiveness and impact and sustainability shortfalls, calling for larger-scale evaluation and complementary structural approaches, such as those bolstering FSW social cohesion and tackling socio-economic barriers.</description>

METHODS: The data were obtained from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling individuals aged 50 and older. The outcome measured was the perception of discrimination in five different settings. The main explanatory variables were self-identified/self-perceived race (Whites and Non-whites) and gender, while covariates included education level, equivalized per capita income, depression, and the use of dental prostheses. Negative binomial and logistic regressions with interaction terms between race, gender and severe tooth loss were used to estimate the intersections between gender and race-related perceived discrimination inequities. RESULTS: The analytical sample comprised 8,556 respondents with complete variables. While the prevalence of perceived discrimination in white Brazilians was 14.3% (95%CI: 12.2;16.3), it was 18.8% (95%CI: 16.8;20.6) among non-Whites. The interaction of being female, non-white and with severe tooth loss showed higher chances of perceived discrimination in 50-59 years [RR = 1.53(95%CI: 1.01;2.28)]. Moreover, being non-white with severe loss in 60-69 years [RR = 1.74(95%CI: 1.13;2.69)] had higher chances of perceived discrimination adjusted by all covariates. A sensitivity analysis of all older adults confirmed the findings. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the intersection between severe tooth loss, race, and gender, with more pronounced associations among women and non-white individuals. These results reinforce the importance of equity-oriented oral health policies and interventions within the Family Health Strategy, particularly for populations experiencing severe tooth loss.</description>

Given the analgesic potential of music and the underlying crosstalk between auditory and nociceptive pathways, this study aims to delineate the neural circuits interfacing auditory processing and visceral pain modulation. Using a mouse model of early-life stress, we identify a cortico-cortical circuit linking the primary auditory cortex (Au1) to the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that mediates stress-induced visceral pain. Mechanistically, early-life stress suppresses the activity of Au1 inhibitory (GABAergic, Au1GABA) neurons, which disinhibits downstream ACC excitatory (glutamatergic, ACCGlu) neurons, thereby driving visceral hypersensitivity. Notably, music intervention alleviates visceral pain by restoring Au1GABA neuronal activity and suppressing ACCGlu activity. In conclusion, this study unveils the Au1-ACC circuit as a critical hub for stress-induced visceral hypersensitivity and music-induced analgesia, providing a mechanistic foundation for clinical translation of music therapy in visceral pain management.</description>

DESIGN: Cross sectional population based study. SETTING: Four urban and three rural communities in Hubei Province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3068 women aged 20-54 years with regular menstrual cycles, enrolled between September 2021 and January 2025. INTERVENTIONS: HPV testing using minipad collected menstrual blood, clinician collected cervical samples, and ThinPrep cytology. Women who tested HPV positive by either collection method or by cytology (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse) were referred for colposcopy directed biopsy sampling. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Diagnostic accuracy for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+. RESULTS: Among 3068 participants, minipad based HPV testing showed a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% confidence interval 80.9% to 99.1%) for CIN2+ detection, comparable to clinician based HPV testing (92.1%, 77.5% to 97.9%; P=1.00). Although minipad HPV testing showed a lower specificity than clinician HPV testing (89.1%, 88.0% to 90.2% v 90.0%, 88.9% to 91.1%; P=0.001), the negative predictive value matched that of clinician HPV testing (99.9%, 99.7% to 100.0% v 99.9%, 99.7% to 100.0%; P=1.00). Both collection methods had a similar positive predictive value (9.9%, 7.1% to 13.5% v 10.4%, 7.4% to 14.3%; P=0.82) and screening efficiency (10.1 v 9.6 referrals per CIN2+ detected; P=0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Minipad collected menstrual blood showed comparable diagnostic accuracy to clinician collected cervical samples for HPV testing for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+.

In this study, we developed a computational model integrating blood pressure regulation and Ca2+-Mg2+ homeostasis in a male rat. We simulated various conditions, including hypertension, Ca2+, Mg2+, and vitamin D3 deficiencies, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Simulations of hypertension, induced by various stimuli like increased renin or aldosterone secretion, demonstrated significant effects on parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, renal Ca2+/Mg2+ handling, and bone resorption. Dietary Ca2+, Mg2+, and vitamin D3 deficiencies was predicted to elevate mean arterial pressure, with Mg2+ deficiency having a stronger effect. Furthermore, the model predicted that primary hyperparathyroidism elevates PTH, Ca2+, and calcitriol, leading to increased mean arterial pressure and bone loss. Overall, this model provides valuable insights into the mechanistic links between blood pressure regulation and Ca2+-Mg2+ homeostasis, offering insights into clinical conditions like hypertension and hyperparathyroidism.</description>

Of all the causes of AIP, iron deficiency anaemia is the commonest, accounting for approximately half of cases. While oral iron treatment is standard according to the WHO recommendation, poor adherence is a concern. Intravenous (IV) iron is an alternative treatment, especially in cases where oral iron is challenging to utilise. However, this intervention is yet to be integrated into routine antenatal care. This study aimed to assess skilled health personnels' (SHPs) perceptions of the acceptability and feasibility of IV iron in managing AIP in Lagos and Kano based on SHP characteristics and changes over time. METHODS: This was a repeated cross-sectional study embedded within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) conducted in 11 healthcare facilities in Lagos and Kano states, Nigeria. All SHPs trained in implementing IV iron were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected using the Acceptability and Feasibility of Intervention measure (AIM and FIM) survey tools between the RCT baseline in August 2021 and the endline in May 2023. Analysis was done using descriptive statistics, independent and Paired T-tests and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Stata. RESULTS: Of the 60 SHPs invited at baseline (pre-implementation), 53 (88%) completed the survey. At endline (post-implementation), 39 of the 46 SHPs involved in IV iron implementation responded (85%). When comparing groups, baseline AIM scores differed significantly by state (p = 0.001), though this was not sustained at endline. No other significant differences were seen by cadre or facility for AIM, and FIM did not differ significantly by state, cadre, or facility at either time point. Among the 20 SHPs who completed both surveys, the AIM score increased from baseline 16.8/20 (Standard deviation, SD = 2.0) to endline (18.5, SD = 2.0) (p = 0.002). FIM scores also increased over time, 17.1/20 (SD = 2.3) versus 18.2/20 (SD = 1.7) (p = 0.088). CONCLUSION: Post-implementation, IV iron was perceived as highly acceptable and feasible with no differences across cadre, state, or facility levels. While acceptability significantly improved over time, feasibility also increased, though not statistically significantly at the 0.05 level.</description>

Although several temperament assessments exist, many rely on subjective evaluations, highlighting the need for scientifically validated methods. This study evaluated the validity of the Wesen temperament test by examining its association with physiological biomarkers-salivary cortisol and serotonin. Twenty-four dogs (11 females and 13 males) completed a modified Wesen test comprising seven subtests: Unconscious Confidence, Sociality, Noise Stability, Movement Stability, Desire for Play and Predation, Behavior in Stressful Situations, and Separation. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-assessment, and cortisol and serotonin concentrations were measured using ELISA. Hormonal concentrations and temperament scores were analyzed using correlation, regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pre-assessment cortisol concentrations were negatively correlated with total average temperament score and several subtest scores. Post-assessment cortisol concentrations showed significant negative correlations with total average scores and all subtests. Changes in cortisol concentrations from pre- to post-assessment were negatively associated with temperament scores. Dogs with higher temperament scores exhibited significantly higher serotonin concentrations than those with lower scores. These results support the utility of temperament assessments validated through physiological markers and provide novel evidence linking canine temperament with endocrine function.</description>

This study evaluated head and neck free flap outcomes in patients on baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis regimens. METHODS: Patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction at a single tertiary, academic institution were included. Patients were grouped according to baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis regimens. The primary outcome was overall complication rate, while secondary outcomes included flap compromise, flap failure, bleeding, venous thrombotic events, and arterial thrombotic events. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test and risk ratio (RR) regression analysis, using propensity score-adjusted models. RESULTS: Of 470 patients, 16.6% experienced postoperative complications. Longer preoperative holds (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 0.04) and delayed resumption of baseline blood thinners (OR = 1.56, p = 0.04) were associated with increased complication risk, particularly flap compromise. Unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates compared to sequential compression devices (RR = 3.10, p = 0.018) and low molecular weight heparin (RR = 2.79, p &lt; 0.001) for DVT prophylaxis. No other perioperative blood thinner regimens were significantly associated with postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Most regimens, including baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis, can be managed safely in the perioperative period. However, unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates than other DVT prophylaxis regimens. While baseline blood thinners did not increase most complications, prolonged preoperative holding and delayed resumption may jeopardize flap viability-highlighting a modifiable point of intervention.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Uozaki H, Kikuchi Y, Watanabe M, Tsuchiya M, Yasui M, Watabe S, Kato M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57812'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.57812&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642622/'&gt;41642622&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Conventional cancer statistics account only for individuals with a clinical diagnosis, overlooking potentially large numbers of undetected malignant neoplasms. Autopsy-based studies offer a unique opportunity to estimate the burden of cancer, including latent tumors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term trends and characteristics of cancers using a nationwide autopsy registry in Japan. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study of hospital-based autopsies over a 66-year period (1958-2023) obtained data from the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan (APAC-J), a nationwide database maintained by the Japanese Society of Pathology. Latent cancers, defined as malignant neoplasms undiagnosed during life but discovered at autopsy, were analyzed based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition. All autopsies recorded in APAC-J were included. The data were analyzed between May 7 and August 2, 2025. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the proportion of total, multiple, and latent cancers by year, age group, and sex based on trends in latent cancer detection; metastatic status of latent cancers; and the enrichment ratio in autopsy, a novel metric comparing cancer prevalence in autopsies with national mortality statistics. RESULTS: From 1958 to 2023, 1 486 557 autopsies were registered in APAC-J (mean age based on available age group data, 59.1 years; 62.5% male), with 55.2% including cancer diagnoses. The proportion of multiple primary cancers increased from 1.8% (420 of 22 989) in 1974 to 14.4% (957 of 6661) in 2023. The enrichment ratio in autopsy was elevated in adolescents (aged 15-19 years), young adults (aged 20-24 years), and adults aged 80 years or older. Since 1986, 36 133 latent cancers were found in 34 174 of 811 159 autopsies (4.2%). The detection rate of latent cancers increased from 1.7% (683 of 39 839) in 1986 to 7.4% (493 of 6661) in 2023. Latent prostate cancer at age 75 to 79 years was identified in 4.5% (corresponding to a 2017-2021 prevalence of 656.2 per 100 000 population), 6.9-fold higher than the clinical incidence, whereas latent thyroid cancer at age 50 to 54 years showed substantially larger excesses (0.9% of men and 1.7% of women, representing 94.5-fold and 60.7-fold higher prevalences, respectively). Overall, metastases were present in 7.3% of latent cancers (2649 of 36 133). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study of autopsies across Japan found a substantial reservoir of undiagnosed cancer, including some with metastatic potential. These findings highlight the persistent value of autopsy for assessing cancer burden and underscore the need to refine approaches for early detection while minimizing overdiagnosis.</description>

METHODS: Prior work developed and validated 16 head and neck reference plans, based on established international dosimetry audits for intensity modulated radiotherapy treatments. Realistic modifications, developed from reported variations in clinical practice, were introduced into nine copies of each plan, generating 144 modified plans. These plans were grouped as acceptable (should pass) and unacceptable (should fail) using plan assessment metrics and action limits on CTVmean, CTVD95, and OARD0.03cc. In the current work, each GHG audit system measured the error-free reference plans on its own phantom using its standard workflow. The measured error-free plans were then compared to the dose calculations of the modified plans. Outcomes were expressed as pass/fail, which were then compared to the "should pass/should fail" benchmark to determine the sensitivity and specificity of each system. An optimal action limit was determined for each audit system to achieve a common sensitivity across all audit systems. RESULTS: All audit systems reliably identified failing plans (sensitivity 0.92-1.0; specificity 0.40-0.91) with 5% ΔCTVmean assessment action thresholds. Adjusting the action limit revealed that each audit system was tuned to detect different error thresholds (3.3% - 5.7%). Changing audit system action limits specificity, while preserving system sensitivity. CONCLUSION: The comparably high sensitivity across all audit systems could allow harmonising of dosimetry audits for clinical trials on an international scale based on sensitivity alone. Future work harmonising specificity would help streamline credentialing for international clinical trials.</description>

However, this could result in insufficient lowering of DOAC levels that could increase bleeding risk. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of patients with elevated DOAC levels at the time of elective surgery, evaluate factors associated with DOAC levels, and examine associated blood loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study (DOAC Level Prior to Incision [DALI]) assessed adult patients prescribed a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) for any indication and at any dose, undergoing an elective procedure requiring DOAC interruption between May 27, 2018, and February 25, 2024, at 2 Dutch hospitals. EXPOSURE: Standardized interruption protocol (1 day before moderate- and 2 days before high bleeding-risk procedures) with interruption adjustments for the patient's kidney function. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Blood was drawn immediately before surgery to determine DOAC levels (by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry). Proportions of preoperative DOAC levels of 30 ng/mL or higher and their 95% CIs were estimated, stratified by DOAC type and surgical bleeding risk. Factors associated with DOAC levels were identified through multivariable linear regression. Surgical blood loss and 30-day postoperative complications were described according to DOAC concentrations. RESULTS: The study was terminated after including 257 patients (100 receiving apixaban, 100 receiving rivaroxaban, and 57 receiving dabigatran due to the slow inclusion rate of those receiving dabigatran; median [IQR] age, 72 [66-78] years; 173 male [67%]); 212 patients (82%) underwent a high bleeding-risk operation. Preprocedural DOAC levels were 30 ng/mL or higher in 7.6% (95% CI, 4.9%-11.6%) of patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban had similar proportions, whereas 13.1% (95% CI, 7.8%-21.2%) of patients treated with apixaban had levels of 30 ng/mL or higher. Treatment with apixaban, decreased kidney function, and a shorter interruption time were associated with higher levels. Surgical blood loss (median [range], 0 [0-4250] mL) was not associated with DOAC levels. Twelve patients (4.7%; 95% CI, 2.7%-8.0%), who all had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, experienced major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, most patients following the current protocol had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, although the proportion of patients with elevated levels was higher for apixaban. Preoperative DOAC levels were not associated with blood loss during surgery.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 12-month effectiveness of lay counselor-delivered, telephone-based behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions in reducing loneliness and enhancing well-being among at-risk older adults and to examine whether social isolation mediates these effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Helping Alleviate Loneliness in Hong Kong Older Adults (HEAL-HOA) was a 3-arm, assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted from April 1, 2021, to April 28, 2024. Eligible participants 65 years or older who were living alone, digitally excluded, lonely, and experiencing financial hardship were recruited from public housing estates, community centers, academies for older adults, and word of mouth. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive telephone-delivered behavioral activation (Tele-BA), telephone-delivered mindfulness (Tele-MF), or telephone-delivered befriending (Tele-BF [attention control]). INTERVENTIONS: Participants received eight 30-minute sessions delivered by trained lay counselors via telephone for 4 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was loneliness, measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS) and the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (DJGL). Secondary outcomes included perceived stress, social support, sleep quality, life satisfaction, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and psychological well-being. Social isolation was examined as a mediator. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 4152 individuals screened, 1151 participants (mean [SD] age, 76.6 [7.8] years; 843 [73.2%] female; 965 [83.8%] with ≥1 chronic illness) were randomized (Tele-BA, 335 [29.1%]; Tele-MF, 460 [40.0%]; Tele-BF, 356 [30.9%]). Intention-to-treat analyses using linear mixed-effects models showed significant between-group changes in loneliness at 12 months for Tele-BA (UCLA-LS: mean difference [MD], -0.73; 95% CI, -1.29 to -0.16; P = .01; DJGL: MD, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.03; P = .01) and Tele-MF (UCLA-LS: MD, -0.72; 95% CI, -1.24 to -0.20; P = .003) compared with Tele-BF. Secondary outcomes, including sleep quality, psychological well-being, and life satisfaction, also improved significantly. Social isolation at 6 months partially mediated the effect on loneliness (UCLA-LS) for both interventions at 12 months (accounting for 0.13 [13.5%] and 0.18 [18.0%] of the total effects for Tele-BA and Tele-MF, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, brief telephone-delivered behavioral activation and mindfulness interventions by lay counselors sustainably reduced loneliness and enhanced well-being during 12 months in at-risk older adults, with social isolation as a partial mediator. These scalable interventions offered effective solutions for combating late-life loneliness. Future research should investigate the applicability of these interventions outside the Hong Kong context as well as their cost-effectiveness.

In-person interpretation is frequently unavailable, and while video remote interpreting (VRI) remains underused, its scalability may be a solution given interpreter shortages and cost barriers. Existing research focuses on user and interpreter preferences, leaving a critical gap in understanding how interpretation formats affect communication quality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of VRI in improving communication outcomes between Deaf patients and physicians compared with usual communication tools, such as self-arranging interpretation, lip-reading, note-taking, and the use of images. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Colombia at a public hospital from August 2023 to October 2024, involving Deaf adults who use Colombian Sign Language as their primary language. Participants were randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group. The data were analyzed between January and May 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into 2 groups: an intervention group that received a medical appointment via VRI and a control group that received one via the current standard of communication. Both the Deaf participants and the health care professionals were blinded to the allocation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: An assessment of communication using the Doctor-Patient Communication scale. RESULTS: Data were collected from 210 Deaf participants, including 123 (58.6%) women and 87 (41.4%) men, with a mean (SD) age of 42 (13) years (range, 18-84 years). Overall, 108 participants (51.4%) reported using VRI. The intervention revealed that having VRI did not always result in improved communication between Deaf individuals and physicians. While those using VRI were more likely to report positive outcomes in certain areas, such as being encouraged to express themselves (odds ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13-3.18; P = .02), there was no difference in other areas, such as understanding the doctor (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.79-2.23; P = .28). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of VRI in the health care context, some aspects of clinical communication were improved, but others were not. This suggests that critical preconditions have to be met for this technology to achieve its intended impact. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05966623.</description>

A person's body mass index (BMI) is a key factor, affecting the thickness of facial soft tissues. PURPOSE: This study aims to examine the association between BMI and facial anthropometric measurements. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND SAMPLE: This prospective, observational (cross-sectional) study was conducted among undergraduate dental students at the Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences (PGIDS), Rohtak, who were originally from Haryana. Subjects with a history of trauma and congenital or chronic diseases affecting craniofacial morphology, facial surgeries, facial deformities, orthodontic treatment, or systemic diseases such as hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism or diabetes that could influence BMI were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: BMI (ratio of body weight to the square of standing height) served as the predictor, and participants were categorized into four groups: underweight (BMI &lt;18.5), normal (BMI = 18.5 to 22.9), overweight (BMI = 23 to 24.9), and obese (BMI ≥25). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE(S): Measurements for 12 facial anthropometric parameters were obtained using a digital vernier caliper. COVARIATES: The covariates were sex and age. ANALYSES: One-way ANOVA, general linear model, and independent sample t test were utilized for statistical analysis. The significance criterion was P &lt; .01. RESULTS: Among the 202 subjects included, 137 (67.8%) were female, and 65 (32.2%) were male. Participants ranged in age from 18 to 30 years, with a mean age of 21.59 ± 1.82 years. Statistically significant differences were observed in face width (P &lt; .001), lower facial width (P &lt; .001), nose width (P &lt; .001), and lower third face height (P = .002) across BMI categories. The mean BMI showed a statistically significant difference regarding sex; however, this difference was not significant concerning age (≤20 years vs &gt;20 years). There was a statistically significant relationship between sex and the studied facial anthropometric parameters, except for nose length, face height (middle third), and facial index. Subjects ≤20 years versus &gt;20 years showed a statistically significant difference in outercanthal distance, nose length, and mouth width. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The study results suggest that BMI is associated with facial anthropometric measurements; therefore, it may be important to adjust anthropometric measures for BMI when planning orthodontic treatment, esthetic surgeries, and facial reconstruction.</description>

However, little is known about the association between spending and their overall survival (OS). METHODS: We recruited 11,037 ESCC patients who were admitted between August, 2009 and December, 2018 at the Southern Center (Cancer Hospital of Shantou University Medical College), and between January, 2012 to December, 2017 at the Northern Center (Anyang Cancer Hospital). Spending terciles were the exposure measure, and OS was the outcome. OS in terciles 2 and 3 was compared with OS in tercile 1 (the lowest spending tercile) using Cox regression models. Analyses were stratified by TNM stage and study center. RESULTS: Monthly hospital spending followed an "L-shaped" trend. After a maximum follow-up of 12.52 years, the median survival time was 4.70 years. Higher spending was associated with worse OS in stage 0-II patients (adjusted HRtercile 3 vs 1 = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.27-1.89), but with better OS in stage III-IV patients (adjusted HRtercile 2 vs 1 = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.74-0.90; adjusted HRtercile 3 vs 1 = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.64-0.83). These associations were consistent across both the Southern and Northern Centers. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that early-stage ESCC patients may benefit from more conservative treatment approaches, whereas advanced-stage patients require comprehensive and sufficient treatment.</description>

While international guidelines provide an overarching evidence framework for breast cancer management, their practical application at the regional level often requires adaptation to local healthcare resources. There is an unmet need to optimize the treatment sequencing strategies for patients with HR+/HER2-negative mBC in the GCC region through expert guidance. Given this context, a virtual advisory board involving 10 oncologists from the GCC region was convened in November 2024. The panel aimed to review current evidence and develop pragmatic, implementable recommendations for second-line management. This consensus uniquely contextualizes global evidence for GCC-specific healthcare constraints, addressing gaps in diagnostic access, affordability, and real-world feasibility, while providing treatment recommendations that help clinicians refine therapeutic strategies and incorporate patient preferences for improved outcomes. The panel recommends early genomic testing (PIK3CA, AKT, BRCA, ESR1) to guide therapy, prioritizing targeted agents such as oral SERDs and PI3K/AKT inhibitors in second-line sequencing, cautious use of alpelisib in diabetic patients, and incorporating patient preferences through shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care.</description>

METHODS: Using data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021, we analyzed the incidence, mortality, and DALYs of breast, ovarian, and thyroid cancers across 15 countries (1990-2021). Trends were quantified using EAPC, and mortality trajectories through 2050 were projected using GAM. RESULTS: Breast cancer exhibited a polarized pattern: mortality steadily declined in High-SDI nations but surged in Low-SDI regions. Thyroid cancer revealed a dichotomy of screening-driven overdiagnosis in High-SDI settings versus high lethality in Low-SDI areas. Ovarian cancer maintained the poorest prognosis in resource-limited settings. Crucially, primary risk drivers are shifting from traditional behavioral factors to metabolic factors. CONCLUSION: With disparities projected to widen by 2050, stratified interventions are urgent. We recommend screening de-escalation for High-SDI nations and resource-adapted measures for Low-to-Middle SDI nations to bridge the growing equity gap. reproductive-age women.</description>

The impact of recent interventions on prescribing habits of surgeons across different experience levels is not well understood. PURPOSE: This study measured the association between oral and maxillofacial surgeon experience (years in practice, YIP) and opioid prescribing rate to Medicare beneficiaries. It also compares prescription volume and duration across YIP groups. STUDY DESIGN/SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study used the 2022 Medicare Part D Prescribers Dataset focusing on providers with specialty of oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). PREDICTOR: The primary predictor was YIP, categorized as 0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and ≥14 years. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was opioid prescribing rate (% all annual prescriptions that were opioids). Secondary outcomes were opioid prescriptions per beneficiary and days' supply per claim. COVARIATES: These included surgeon sex and region, total Medicare beneficiaries, and beneficiary demographics (percentage female, mean age, and mean hierarchical condition category score). ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics, χ2 tests, and Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn-Bonferroni post hoc comparisons were conducted. Multiple linear regression was performed with opioid prescribing rate as the dependent variable, YIP as a continuous predictor, and surgeon/beneficiary characteristics as covariates. RESULTS: The study included 7,097 oral and maxillofacial surgeons and 563,536 opioid prescriptions to Medicare recipients. Providers with ≥14 YIP comprised of 67.1% of all prescribers but 71.7% of all opioid prescriptions. Opioid prescribing rate for 9-13 YIP and ≥14 YIP were 22.9 and 24.6%, respectively, which were significantly higher than 14.6% for 0-3 YIP (P &lt; .01). Opioid prescriptions per beneficiary and days' supply per claim were similar between YIP. In multiple linear regression, YIP was positively associated with opioid prescribing rate (b = 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.39; P &lt; .01). Surgeon male sex (P &lt; .01) and practice outside the Northeast (P &lt; .01) were also associated with higher prescribing rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These results suggest potential generational differences in opioid stewardship among oral and maxillofacial surgeons treating Medicare beneficiaries. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the effects of specific interventions on prescribing behavior.</description>

METHODS: LRT proton plans were created retrospectively for 12 patients with head-and-neck, thoracic, or abdominal bulky tumors, averaging a gross tumor volume (GTV) of 1011.1 cc (between 333 cc and 3546 cc). The plans were developed in the RayStation treatment planning system (version 2023B), adhering to established consensus guidelines for prescription dose and planning goals. For each plan, 6-8 vertices with an average diameter of 1.4 cm were positioned approximately 3.5 cm apart. The prescription was 18 Gy to each vertex and 3 Gy to the GTV. Single-field optimization (SFO) and multi-field optimization (MFO) techniques were employed. The dosimetric parameters of GTV Dmean, D95%, generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD a=-10), vertex D90%, peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and skin D1% were used for plan quality assessment. Plan robustness was also investigated by comparing dose metrics between the nominal and second worst-case scenarios in the robust analysis. RESULTS: For all 12 patients, both SFO and MFO plans achieved a PVDR close to 4 across the three treatment sites. No significant differences in primary dose metrics were observed between SFO and MFO plans, except for skin D1%, which was reduced by an average of 25% in the MFO plans (p&lt;0.05). Robustness evaluation indicated larger deviations in PVDR, GTV Dmean, and skin D1% between nominal and second worst-case scenarios for MFO plans compared to SFO (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Both SFO and MFO techniques can be reliably implemented with current proton beam quality standards and advanced treatment planning algorithms. While SFO offers better plan robustness in maintaining the originally optimized metrics under various treatment-related uncertainties, MFO enhances the ability to spare critical organs.</description>

A silicone impression of the infant's nose and lip was obtained and scanned to produce an standard tessellation language (STL) file, which was processed in 3-Matics software. The conformer was designed by mirroring the normal nostril and applying a 1-mm offset, with incorporated suture holes for intraoperative fixation, and then 3D printed in polymethylmethacrylate. Following Fisher unilateral cleft lip repair, the conformer was secured in place using two 4-0 polypropylene sutures and retained for 3 months. Patients were evaluated 1 year postoperatively for symmetry. The customized conformer maintained nostril patency, improved nasal symmetry, and reduced relapse, contributing to enhanced nasolabial esthetics and stable airway support.</description>

METHODS: A total of 97 patients with NSCLC (30 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 67 with adenocarcinoma (AC)) were included. The parameters f1, f2, f3, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) were measured and compared between the two subtypes. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors, and a combined diagnostic model was developed. The performance of the model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Compared with the AC group, the SCC group exhibited significantly higher SUVmax, f2, and f3 values, and lower ADC and f1 values (all P &lt; 0.05). Smoking status, f1, SUVmax, and ADC were independent predictors of NSCLC subtypes. The combined model demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.909; sensitivity = 73.33%; specificity = 89.55%) compared with individual predictors (AUC = 0.693, 0.819, 0.767, and 0.742 for smoking status, f1, SUVmax, and ADC, respectively; all P &lt; 0.01). Bootstrap resampling (1000 samples) validated the robustness of the model (AUC = 0.895). Calibration curves and DCA confirmed the model's stability and clinical utility. CONCLUSION: RSI can effectively differentiate NSCLC subtypes.</description>

Existing studies are limited in scope, highlighting the need for large-scale studies to clarify the prevalence and clinical relevance of these oral outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network to analyze COVID-19 patients from 2020 to 2025. Queried oral conditions, including ulcers, taste alterations, salivary disturbances, and mucosal lesions. Propensity score matching was used to balance age, sex, and comorbidities. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated, with significance set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: Among 4,875,258 adults with COVID-19, the most common oral outcomes were taste alteration (0.588%), aphthous ulcers (0.106%), salivary disturbances (0.053%), and stomatitis (0.025%). Compared with age, sex, and co-morbid matched controls, COVID-19 was associated with a higher risk of taste alteration (OR = 10.11; P &lt; .0001) and herpetic oral lesions (OR = 1.46; P &lt; .0001), while other oral conditions were less frequent. Anti-COVID-19 medication use was associated with a lower incidence of taste alteration (0.14% vs 0.54%; P &lt; .0001) and higher records of aphthous ulcers and herpetic lesions. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a significantly increased risk of taste alteration and herpetic oral lesions, while anti-COVID-19 medication use is associated with lower odds of taste alteration.</description>

As patients use expands, understanding the spectrum of oral adverse events (OAEs) has become essential. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX research network. A 5‑year observation window identified patients prescribed anti‑TNF-α therapies. Patients with prior oral conditions, concurrent cancer therapies, or antiresorptive exposure were excluded. OAEs were categorized into xerostomia, mucosal disorders, infectious disorders, gingival hyperplasia, medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Propensity score matching (1:1, age/sex) compared anti‑TNF-α users with unexposed controls. RESULTS: In a cohort of 1,645,751 individuals receiving anti‑TNF‑α therapy, OAEs were frequent, with oral lichenoid lesions (1.27%, 20,135), candidiasis (1.09%, 17,475), xerostomia (0.87%, 14,024), stomatitis (0.68%, 10,904), and oral herpes (0.39%, 6,343) most commonly observed. Less frequent events included MRONJ (0.01%, 173), gingival hyperplasia (0.02%, 285), and OSCC (0.07%, 1,074). Compared with the general population, anti‑TNF‑α therapy significantly increased the odds of most mucosal and infectious conditions (P &lt; .001), though oral lichen planus showed no association. Interestingly, OSCC exhibited an inverse association (OR = 0.75, P &lt; .0001), suggesting a potential protective effect. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of routine oral health surveillance and robust pharmacovigilance amongst patients on anti‑TNF-α therapies.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: This is a multicenter retrospective study that evaluated the agreement between clinical and histopathological diagnoses in 20,005 oral and maxillofacial pathology cases from Brazilian universities over 11 years. The analysis also included information on cases where radiographic examinations were requested as complementary diagnostic procedures. RESULTS: The overall agreement rate was 67.8% (Kappa = 0.23). Most cases occurred in 2018 and 2019, decreasing significantly in 2020. Agreement was excellent for potentially malignant, epithelial, dermatological-immunological, and salivary gland lesions (Kappa &gt; 0.85) and weak for bone lesions, developmental defects, and odontogenic tumors (Kappa &lt; 0.15). Radiographic examinations were requested in 25.9% of all cases, with cystic lesions representing 78.6% of these requests. The odontogenic tumor group accounted for a small proportion of cases, and among these few cases, radiographic examinations were seldom requested (19.7%), which may have contributed to the lower agreement between clinical and histopathologic diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical-histopathological agreement varied between diagnostic groups. Greater training and complementary exams are needed to improve diagnostic accuracy, especially in lesions with low agreement.</description>

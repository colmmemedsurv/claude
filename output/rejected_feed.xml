      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hodson DJ, Shouse G, Shin HJ, Salar A, Bobillo S, Ribrag V, Macpherson NA, Cordoba R, Kim JS, Guidez S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2239'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2239&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41427952/'&gt;41427952&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: An unmet treatment need remains for relapsed/refractory (R/R) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), including the follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) subtypes. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is dysregulated and associated with poor prognosis in NHL. The AKT inhibitor capivasertib has preclinical activity in hematologic malignancy models. METHODS: NCT05008055 was a modular, open-label, multicenter phase II study that examined oral capivasertib monotherapy in patients with R/R B-cell NHL who had received ≥2 prior lines of therapy. Patients had R/R FL (Cohort 1A), MZL (Cohort 1B), or MCL (Cohort 1C). Capivasertib 480 mg twice daily was administered orally 4 days on/3 days off. The primary objective was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review. RESULTS: 30 patients were enrolled (of 272 planned). The ORRs for patients with R/R FL, MZL, and MCL were 18.8% (3/16), 33.3% (1/3), and 30% (3/10), respectively; 62.5% (10/16) of patients with R/R FL had stable disease. Baseline tumor PTEN expression was deficient/undetectable in the two patients who had a complete response and three of five patients who had a partial response. The most common capivasertib-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (63.3%), nausea (20%), vomiting (13.3%), and hyperglycemia (10%). Capivasertib-related grade ≥3 AEs or serious AEs were observed in 9 and 3 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: The study was terminated early with a small sample size, limiting interpretation, although antitumor activity was limited. Future studies of capivasertib in hematologic malignancies would likely require biomarker-directed patient selection and/or combination therapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tawk K, Dichter A, Park T, Abouzari M, Oliaei S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70333'&gt;10.1002/lary.70333&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41424261/'&gt;41424261&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To investigate potential risk factors associated with the development of sialolithiasis in a database-driven case-control study. METHODS: The All of Us database was queried for participants with sialolithiasis. These participants were matched to controls by age, race, and gender. Demographics and medical history data, such as obesity, hypertension, tonsillitis, gout, and other conditions associated with salivary stones, were extracted and compared among participants. A logistic regression model using optimized parameters was used to identify variables associated with sialolithiasis. RESULTS: In total, 2160 participants were included in the analysis, with 540 diagnosed with sialolithiasis and 1620 matched controls. Sjogren's syndrome (OR = 2.057, 95% CI: 1.106-3.824, p = 0.023) and obesity (OR = 1.419, 95% CI: 1.118-1.802, p = 0.004) were significantly associated with increased odds of sialolithiasis, while essential hypertension (OR = 0.279, 95% CI: 0.23-0.339, p = 0.0) and Type 2 diabetes without complication (OR = 0.771, 95% CI: 0.601-0.989, p = 0.041) were inversely associated. No significant associations were observed for dehydration, hyperparathyroidism, acute tonsillitis, alcohol abuse, smoking, hypercalcemia, gout, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, systemic lupus erythematosus, osteoporosis, or bipolar disorder. CONCLUSIONS: This study, using a large-scale database, aimed to identify potential risk factors associated with sialolithiasis, thereby improving our understanding of its pathogenesis and paving the way for early diagnosis and intervention. The commonality among the identified risk factors appears to be their association with reduced salivary flow or alterations in fluid dynamics and composition, which are known contributors to the formation of salivary stones.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cardwell CR, Baxter SM, Snelling AJ, Chen DT, Atakpa EC, McMenamin Ú, McIntosh SA, Hicks B, Coupland CA, Brady AJ, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67800-7'&gt;10.1038/s41467-025-67800-7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41423616/'&gt;41423616&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The role of the gut microbiota in carcinogenesis is increasingly being acknowledged. Recent studies in multiple breast cancer mouse models have found that antibiotics, by altering the gut microbiota, can accelerate tumour growth. In humans, a recent cohort study restricted to triple negative breast cancer showed that breast cancer patients using a greater number of antibiotics had markedly worse survival. These studies have raised concerns about repeated antibiotic use in breast cancer patients. In this Registered Report, we investigated whether breast cancer patients using oral antibiotics had increased breast cancer-specific mortality. In population-based cohorts (n = 44,452), we did not observe a statistically significant association between antibiotic prescriptions after diagnosis and breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 1.07 95% CI 0.87, 1.33) apart from prescriptions of 12 or more antibiotics (adjusted HR = 1.62 95% CI 1.31, 2.01). This association was weaker after adjustment for infections (adjusted HR = 1.44 95% 1.14, 1.81), when restricted to antibiotics within five years (adjusted HR = 1.33 95% 0.95, 1.84), and was similar for deaths from other causes (adjusted HR = 1.69 95% 1.19, 2.41). Frequent antibiotic users had higher cancer-specific mortality but the attenuation of associations in sensitivity analyses, and similar findings for other causes of death, suggest this increase may reflect residual confounding. Protocol registration: The Stage 1 protocol for this Registered Report was accepted in principle on 7 November 2023.

METHODS: ProsD is a phase-II double-blinded randomized trial of newly diagnosed, low-intermediate risk PC cases, aged between 50 and 80 years and on AS. The intervention was a monthly oral dose of cholecalciferol (50,000IU; Vitamin D) or placebo. Primary and secondary endpoints were active therapy-free (ATFS) and progression-free (PFS) survival, respectively. Blood samples were analysed for vitamin D metabolites and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN) markers for lymphocytic genome damage. RESULTS: There were 123 randomised participants (81 vitamin D and 42 placebo) included in this analysis. Mean (SD) for age was 66.5 (6.6) years and for 25(OH)D levels were 72.0 (19.9) and 66.4 (18.4) nmol/L at baseline (p = 0.1), and 91.9 (19.9) and 60.4 (24.4) nmol/L at 24 months, in the vitamin D and placebo arms respectively. There were no appreciable differences in ATFS (plog-rank = 0.44), PFS (p plog-rank = 0.60) and occurrence of adverse events, in each trial arm. There were declines in some of the lymphocytic CBMN markers in the vitamin D arm. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation did not prevent PC progression, although reduced prevalence of CBMN markers may indicate a benefit of vitamin D supplementation.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kelley MR, Wan J, Liu S, Kpenu E, Wireman R, Mosley AL, Liu H, Lakhani NJ, Shahda S, O'Neil B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The oncologist | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1093/oncolo/oyaf423'&gt;10.1093/oncolo/oyaf423&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41423797/'&gt;41423797&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: APX3330 is an oral agent targeting the redox signaling activity of APE1/Ref-1 (Ref-1), a key regulator of transcription factors involved in inflammation and tumorigenesis. APX3330 selectively inhibits Ref-1's redox function without affecting its DNA repair role. This Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study in advanced solid tumors was aimed at determining the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) while assessing safety, pharmacokinetics, and biomarker evidence of target engagement. METHODS: Nineteen cancer patients were treated, with eight completing follow-up. Subjects received APX3330 orally twice daily in 21-day cycles, starting at 240 mg/day and escalating in 120 mg/day increments. Adverse event (AE) monitoring followed a 1 pt/cohort approach until a &gt;G2 toxicity event, after which a 3 + 3 design was implemented. Treatment continued until disease progression, consent withdrawal, or intolerable toxicity. Antitumor activity was assessed using RECIST 1.1, and pharmacodynamic markers included serum Ref-1 levels and circulating tumor cells. RESULTS: Six of nineteen subjects had stable disease, and no treatment-related SAEs were observed. One subject (720 mg cohort) withdrew due to Grade 3 maculopapular rash (dose-limiting toxicity). Laboratory assessments and ECGs showed no clinically significant abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: APX3330 showed preliminary signals of disease control and on-target pharmacology in this first-in-human study. Based on safety and PD, the RP2D is 600 mg/day. Given the small sample size, efficacy conclusions are exploratory (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03375086).</description>

Here, we investigated multiplexed histological images of paired pre- and on-treatment samples from nine patients with immunotherapy-refractory non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with an oral HDAC inhibitor (vorinostat) combined with a PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab). Patient responses comprised of either stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD). An extensive multiplexed-image analysis pipeline involving both cell segmentation and quadrats, coupled with spatial statistics, machine learning, and deep learning was built to analyze the spatial and temporal features that predict disease progression and identify potential clinical biomarkers. Distinct spatial immune ecologies existed between SD and PD patients, and tumors from PD patients were already characterized by an immune-suppressive environment prior to treatment. Finally, the learned spatial ecologies predicted disease progression better than PD-L1 status alone, suggesting these ecologies could be used as potential companion biomarkers with PD-L1 in NSCLC. These findings will be investigated in a larger-cohort study generated from an ongoing clinical trial (NCT02638090) that includes a wider range of responses including complete and partial responders. Together, this study developed a computational infrastructure for analyzing multiplex imaging to predict immunotherapy response in NSCLC, which can potentially be generalized to any type of cancer.</description>

While various clinical features suggest ODS, diagnosing some ODS patients can be challenging. This study aimed to determine the value of maxillary sinus papillary edema (MSPE) in predicting ODS. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients who underwent at least maxillary antrostomy for unilateral sinus disease (USD). Adequately powered samples of three USD cohorts were generated: ODS, infectious maxillary CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP), and noninfectious CRSwNP. Multiple variables were collected, but the primary outcome was MSPE presence via double-blinded endoscopic image review by three rhinologists. Inter-rater agreement was calculated, and a predictive model for MSPE was generated. RESULTS: Of 41 ODS, 22 infectious CRSsNP, and 13 noninfectious CRSwNP patients, mean age was 57.0 years and 55.3% were female. There was almost perfect agreement between rhinologists when assessing for MSPE on endoscopic images (κ = 0.927). MSPE was seen in 100% of ODS, 22.7% infectious CRSsNP, and 0% CRSwNP. MSPE was significantly more likely in ODS compared to non-odontogenic CRS (p &lt; 0.0001), demonstrating 100% sensitivity and 89.1% specificity for ODS, with 85.7% positive and 100% negative predictive values. CONCLUSIONS: MSPE is a distinct finding that is reliably identifiable and is significantly more likely in ODS compared to infectious CRSsNP and noninfectious CRSwNP. With 100% sensitivity and NPV, MSPE absence makes ODS very unlikely. With 86% PPV, MSPE is not pathognomonic for ODS, but should arouse suspicion for a possible odontogenic source.</description>

This study shows that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)'s inherent bioactivities, including proliferation, metabolism, and colorectal colonization, can be enhanced by manganese, prompting the fabrication of a manganese-engineered strain (MnLR). Oral administration of MnLR with its metabolic substrate-glycerol (MnLR/Gly) promotes the enrichment of L. reuteri and its antitumor metabolites within colon tumors. Across multiple preclinical colon tumor models, MnLR/Gly alone achieves a 95.6% inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth, liver metastases reduction by 62.1%, and confers durable protection, with 75% of prophylactically treated mice remaining long-term tumor-free and 62.5% resisting tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, MnLR/Gly induces both intratumoral and peripheral dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and effector T-cell responses. In orthotopic CRC rabbit models, GlyMnLR enteric capsules demonstrate significant antitumor efficacy comparable to standard chemotherapy while exhibiting favorable safety. These findings highlight MnLR as an effective standalone probiotic therapy for CRC prevention and treatment.</description>

KRM1 is its only known receptor, but its precise role remains unclear. This study investigates CVA6's entry mechanism and antibody neutralization. Cryo-EM shows CVA6 clinical strain HeB primarily exists as mature virions. KRM1 binding within the canyon triggers conversion to uncoating intermediate, defining KRM1 as an uncoating receptor for CVA6. However, KRM1 knockout reduces CVA6 infectivity without affecting attachment. Conversely, disrupting heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) impairs both viral attachment and infectivity, and CVA6 virions bind heparin directly. These results support a two-receptor entry model for CVA6: HSPG mediates viral attachment, while KRM1 induces uncoating. Additionally, we develop two CVA6-specific protective antibodies (1F4 and 3H7), targeting a new antigenic site near the three-fold axis of the viral capsid. These antibodies sterically block KRM1 binding and function post-attachment, consistent with KRM1's role. The findings elucidate CVA6 entry and offer a basis for antibody interventions.</description>

In honeybees (Apis mellifera), a critical defensive behavior is the sting extension reflex. However, it remains unclear how the gut microbiota affects aversive learning and memory of this behavior. Here we demonstrate that the normal gut microbiota contributes to aversive learning and memory of the sting extension reflex in honeybees. Metabolomics analysis reveals that the gut microbiota affects tyrosine metabolism of the gut and hemolymph. Oral reintroduction of Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis restores aversive learning and memory of microbiota-free honeybees, with an increase in their brain dopamine levels by supplying exogenous tyrosine. Conversely, applying fluphenazine, which decreases brain dopamine levels, weakens aversive learning and memory of honeybees in normal hives. These findings provide insights into the role of gut bacteria in regulating aversive learning and memory in honeybees, highlighting beneficial effects of the gut microbiota on the cognitive behaviors of social insects.</description>

However, no previous studies have examined injury patterns within the population of professional and student singers only. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of clinical presentations for laryngologic care among professional and student singers according to age, sex, and diagnosis. METHODS: This retrospective case review collected primary diagnosis, age, sex, and self-reported professional or student status for singers who presented with voice complaints from January 1, 2017 to May 1, 2024. Iatrogenic injuries, malignancy, and neurodegenerative disease processes were excluded. RESULTS: Records of 1139 singers were included (n = 1139, 416 male, 723 female, median age 30, age range 17-79). Presentations were predominantly professional female singers (63% F, 85% professional) between ages 20 and 35. Peaks in presentations were seen at ages 22, 26, and 30, in support of prior literature and clinical observations. A peak in both sexes was also seen at age 52, potentially coinciding with menopause and effects of senescence. There were strongly significant associations between age group and diagnosis and sex and diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001), especially bilateral midfold masses and female sex (p &lt; 0.001) across all age groups (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: These data inform counseling for professional singers and support screening exams at early career milestones to reduce healthcare burden and costs over the lifetime for this high-risk population.</description>

Standard-dose rifampin has limited central nervous system penetration. Whether high-dose rifampin could improve survival outcomes is unknown. METHODS: We performed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving adults with tuberculous meningitis in Indonesia, South Africa, and Uganda. We assigned persons with and those without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection to receive standard daily isoniazid, rifampin (at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram of body weight), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide plus either additional rifampin (for a cumulative dose of 35 mg per kilogram; high-dose group) or matched placebo (standard-dose group) for 8 weeks; participants in both groups received standard therapy for the remainder of the 9-to-12-month treatment course. The primary outcome was 6-month mortality. RESULTS: A total of 499 participants were included in the intention-to-treat population (249 randomly assigned to the high-dose group and 250 to the standard-dose group), of whom 304 (60.9%) were persons living with HIV and 428 (85.8%) had definite or probable tuberculous meningitis. During 6 months of follow-up, 109 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 44.6%) in the high-dose group and 100 participants (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 40.7%) in the standard-dose group died (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.89 to 1.54; P = 0.25). Among the participants who died within 6 months, the median time to death was 13 days (interquartile range, 4 to 39) in the high-dose group and 24 days (interquartile range, 6 to 56) in the standard-dose group. Drug-induced liver injury occurred in 8.0% of the participants in the high-dose group and in 4.4% of those in the standard-dose group, but no deaths from drug-induced liver injury occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with tuberculous meningitis, no evidence of beneficial effect from high-dose rifampin was observed, and the potential for a harmful effect cannot be ruled out.

METHODS: In this multicenter, phase III randomized trial, patients with inoperable, locally advanced stage II-IV ESCC were randomized to receive either CRTCT or RT alone. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), restricted mean survival time (RMST), and patterns of failure. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 75 months, patients in the CRTCT group had longer OS than those in the RT group (hazard ratio (HR), 0.74; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 0.57-0.95; P = 0.02), with better 5-year OS rates (34.1 % vs. 23.6 %,P = 0.02), PFS (31.1 % vs. 20.9 %,P = 0.02), and RMST (33.0 vs. 27.0 months,P = 0.02). CRTCT's effect on OS stabilized over 5 years. Locoregional failure was lower in the CRTCT group (HR, 0.64; 95 % CI, 0.45-0.92; P = 0.02), with similar distant and mixed failure risks. CONCLUSIONS: SIB-RT combined with oral S-1 chemotherapy significantly improved long-term survival and therefore might be considered a standard of care for elderly patients with inoperable ESCC.

Socioeconomic conditions may influence oral frailty risk. This study examined the socioeconomic inequalities in oral frailty and its components among older adults in Japan. METHODS: This cross-sectional study used 2022 questionnaire data from the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study of adults aged ≥ 65 years. Dependent variables included oral frailty and its five components. Oral frailty was defined as having ≥ 2 of the following: fewer teeth, dry mouth, and difficulty in chewing, swallowing, or speaking. Independent variables were socioeconomic factors, comprising educational attainment, income, wealth, and pension type. Age and sex were adjusted as confounders. The Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were estimated after applying multiple imputation to address missing data. RESULTS: A total of 21,924 older adults were included. The prevalence of oral frailty was 33.6%. Significant inequalities were identified across all socioeconomic factors. Wealth showed the greatest inequality, with an adjusted SII of 0.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.14-0.20) and RII of 1.66 (95% CI: 1.52-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial socioeconomic inequalities in oral frailty were observed, with wealth being the most influential factor.</description>

Here, we report the results from cohort A of a multi-cohort, phase II, open-label trial [NCT04777084], evaluating the efficacy and safety of IBI318 (a bispecific anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody, 300 mg intravenous every 2 weeks) plus lenvatinib (a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 8 mg orally daily). Forty patients with advanced NSCLC and acquired resistance to first-line ICIs were enrolled and received at least 1 cycle of the study regimen. The primary endpoint of 12-week objective response rate was 40.0% (95% CI: 24.9-56.7), satisfying prespecified efficacy threshold. Secondary endpoints included other efficacy endpoints and safety. Median progression-free and overall survival were 6.9 months (95% CI: 4.8-9.5) and 18.2 months (95% CI: 10.7-29.1), respectively. The most common treatment-related adverse event was increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (n = 11). Grade ≥3 adverse events occurred in 12.5% (5/40) of patients. Further, we performed a post-hoc exploratory analysis and developed an XGBoost model (scPro-X) using scRNA-seq data from pre-treatment tumor samples to predict 12-week ORR identified CD4_Tfh_CXCL13 and CD8_Tex_CTLA4 as potential biomarkers predictive of response. These findings demonstrate that IBI318 plus lenvatinib exhibit promising clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced NSCLC.</description>

It is also suspected to be associated with neuronal disorders, such as encephalitis and meningitis, in severe cases. Despite its clinical significance, the virus-host interactions underlying SAFV pathogenicity remain largely unknown. Using a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen, we identify the following receptors for SAFV infection: sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and integrin αVβ8. Single knockouts of SLC35B2, an essential gene for sulfated GAG synthesis, or the integrin genes ITGAV or ITGB8 partially reduce SAFV-3 and SAFV-2 susceptibility in HeLa cells, and a double knockout confers complete resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SAFV-3 virions bind directly to sulfated GAGs and integrin αVβ8. Based on these findings, we propose a model of SAFV infection in which sulfated GAGs and integrin αVβ8 act through dual and cooperative pathways to facilitate viral entry.</description>

We aim to evaluate general and disease-specific HRQL changes in patients undergoing surgery for PHPT from their perspective. METHODS: Patients completed three patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) surveys before and after surgery: (1) Worry survey; (2) Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10); and (3) Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System Global-10 (PROMIS). RESULTS: Forty-four patients were included with a median age of 65 years, with 39 females (89%) included. Thirty-two patients (73%) had a single adenoma, and 12 (27%) had multigland disease (parathyroid hyperplasia). Worry scores related to parathyroid cancer, parathyroid surgery, and parathyroid-related problems significantly improved post-operatively (p &lt; 0.05). On PROMIS assessment, there were improved scores in the physical health domain, mental health domain, and general health following parathyroid surgery for PHPT (p &lt; 0.05).

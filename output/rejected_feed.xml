      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; D'Oto AD, Marshall CR, Young VN, Rawat T, Schneider SL, Rosen CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70206'&gt;10.1002/lary.70206&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482817/'&gt;41482817&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: During initial comparison of DaxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (Daxi) to botulinum toxin A (BtxA) in adductor laryngeal dystonia (AdLD) (Phase 1), Daxi administration was found to be safe and efficacious. This study sought to determine the reproducibility of Daxi results (Phase 2) and safety/results for Daxi dose escalation (Phase 3) in patients who previously had been successfully treated with Daxi. METHODS: Thirteen AdLD patients with consistent benefit from BtxA were enrolled in an open-label prospective clinical trial involving repeat administration and/or up-titration of Daxi dose. Duration of voice benefit (DVB) and safety of dose escalation were primary outcomes. PROMs and voice recordings were obtained pre- and post-injection. RESULTS: Twenty-nine total injections (21 repeat dose, 8 dose escalation) were performed in 13 patients (85% female, mean age = 60.4). No adverse events occurred, and there was no difference in EAT-10 pre- to post-injection (repeated dose p = 0.08, dose escalation p = 0.12). In patients who experienced greater benefit with Daxi, average DVB was 112.75 days, 33.5% longer than their average BtxA duration (mean = 84.2 days, p = 0.003). 54% (7/13) had longer DVB with Daxi, and 46% (6/13) had equivocal DVB compared to BtxA DVB by the end of the study. Daxi DVB was comparable to an earlier study, demonstrating reproducibility of Daxi injection results (p = 0.332, SD = 13.6 days). CONCLUSIONS: Our results were variable but showed reproducible results with Daxi, with overall longer DVB with Daxi in 42.8% of total injections, with an average of 33.5% longer DVB than BtxA in a cohort of known Daxi-responsive patients. Daxi dose escalation did not result in significant dysphagia or adverse events. Further studies are needed to determine the clinical utility of Daxi in the treatment of AdLD.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; D'Oto AD, Perrin CE, Marshall CR, Young VN, Rawat T, Gutierrez D, Schneider SL, Shuman EA, Rosen CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70353'&gt;10.1002/lary.70353&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482812/'&gt;41482812&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: Botulinum toxin A (BtxA) injection for AdLD is typically performed approxiamately every 3 months. DaxibotulinumtoxinA-lanm (Daxi) is a peptide-formulated neuromodulator with reported longer therapeutic duration. This study compared the safety and efficacy of Daxi to historical BtxA results in AdLD patients. METHODS: In this open-label, prospective clinical trial, 22 stable-dose, BtxA-responsive AdLD patients underwent Daxi injection. To optimize safety, the first 10 patients' doses were given in a staged fashion (3-6 days between half doses). Safety and duration of voice benefit (DVB) were the primary outcomes. PROMs and voice analyses were obtained pre- and monthly post-injection. RESULTS: Of 22 patients, 20 (75% female, mean age = 58.3) were analyzed, with two excluded for injection "misses." No adverse reactions were reported. EAT-10 showed no difference pre- and post-Daxi injection (p = 0.068). VHI-10 significantly improved (p = 0.004) pre- to post-injection. Procedural LEMG quantitative data for Daxi and BtxA were comparable (p = 0.279). DVB of Daxi was longer than BtxA in 8/20 (40%), equal to BtxA in 7/20 (35%), and shorter than BtxA in 5/19 (25%). Those with Daxi benefit had on average 43.9% (39.5 days) longer therapeutic duration than previous BtxA treatments. Seven patients (35%) returned to BtxA at subsequent injection whereas 13 patients (65%) desired repeat Daxi injection. CONCLUSION: This study represents the first implementation of Daxi for AdLD. Daxi was notably safe and effective. Although no overall significant difference was noted for the entire study cohort, 40% of patients reported substantially longer duration of voice benefit with Daxi than with BtxA, with 43.9% longer duration than their previous BtxA treatments.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Qiu L, Xie Y, Li Y, Huang J, Wang Y, Zhuo Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0339001'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0339001&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481660/'&gt;41481660&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The principal cause of cervical cancer is sustained high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, some cases remain unrelated to HPV infections. Current HPV screening methods have difficulties identifying HPV-negative patients and implementing them in low-resource settings. Therefore, it is important to explore easily accessible and low-cost biomarkers to optimize the current cervical cancer screening strategies. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 6998 women from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), among whom 147 had self-reported cervical cancer. Serum γ - Glutamyltransferase (GGT) was employed as a continuous variable (naturally logarithmically transformed) and a categorical variable (≥50 U/L versus &lt;50 U/L), and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to progressively adjust for demographic features, sexual history, and clinical behaviors. The restricted cubic spline approach was adopted to further explore the dose-response relationship between GGT levels and cervical cancer to depict the potential nonlinear trends between them in a more elaborate manner. We also conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses to ensure reliability of our results. This included multiple imputation of missing data and adjustment for crucial covariates, such as body mass index (BMI) and tobacco exposure, to comprehensively evaluate the impact of different factors on the outcomes. Ultimately, through mediation analysis, we probed the mediating function of tobacco exposure in the association between GGT levels and cervical cancer, aiming to obtain a more profound understanding of the underlying mechanisms of this health-related relationship. RESULTS: Serum GGT levels are positively correlated with cervical cancer risk. For each log unit increase in GGT levels, there was a 31% increased risk of cervical cancer (OR = 1.31, 95%CI: 1.01-1.70, P = 0.041) in the model adjusted for multiple risk factors. When the GGT level reached or exceeded 50 U/L, the risk increased by 76% (OR = 1.76, 95%CI: 1.04-2.98, P = 0.034). This tendency was consistent across several crucial subgroups, particularly among HPV-negative women (OR = 1.36, 95%CI: 1.01-1.84), suggesting that GGT may have some significance in different populations. The results of the sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the main findings remained robust, even when multiple imputations were employed to handle missing data. Nevertheless, the significant association between GGT and cervical cancer weakened when tobacco exposure was further adjusted, indicating that tobacco use might be involved. Mediation analysis further showed that the overall impact of GGT on cervical cancer was statistically significant (β = 0.0014; 95%CI: 0.0001-0.0020; P = 0.046), and approximately 18.15% of the impact was accounted for by tobacco exposure (ACME: β = 0.0003, 95%CI: 0.0001-0.0004, P &lt; 0.001), suggesting a partial mediating role. CONCLUSION: Elevated serum GGT levels are associated with a heightened risk of cervical cancer even in HPV-negative patients. Although this association is partly mediated by tobacco exposure, GGT may still play a role in cervical cancer via nontobacco routes. The potential application of GGT as an auxiliary biomarker requires further validation in prospective studies.</description>

METHODS: In this prospective randomized trial conducted at Liaocheng People's Hospital (2023-2024), 80 STEMI patients undergoing emergency PCI were randomized to: Treatment group: Single subcutaneous evolocumab 140 mg plus oral rosuvastatin 10 mg administered pre-PCI, followed by rosuvastatin 10 mg/day; Control group: Rosuvastatin 10 mg/day alone initiated post-PCI. Primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included angina incidence, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, interleukins, and ST-segment resolution rate (STR). The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2500099498). RESULTS: Primary endpoint (MACEs): 5.0% (treatment group) vs. 12.5% (control group)(P = 0.228) at 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints: Angina incidence: 7.5% vs 27.5% (P = 0.037) at 6-month follow-up; LDL-C reduction: Significant in treatment group at day 1 (2.97 ± 0.63 vs 3.33 ± 0.78 mmol/L; P = 0.029), day 7 (1.66 ± 0.89 vs 2.25 ± 0.77 mmol/L, P = 0.003), and month 1 (P = 0.036); ST-segment resolution &gt;70%: 60% vs 30% (P &lt; 0.05); Inflammatory markers: Lower IL-6 (P = 0.02) and IL-17 (P = 0.01) in treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: While the evolocumab-rosuvastatin combination did not significantly reduce 6-month MACEs, it demonstrated clinically important benefits including reduced angina frequency, accelerated LDL-C lowering, improved myocardial reperfusion, and attenuated inflammatory response, with a favorable safety profile. These findings support further investigation of intensive lipid-lowering strategies in acute STEMI management.</description>

A key innovation of our approach is a specialized transformation mechanism that maps pre-trained word embeddings into cluster-aware text representations. In this new latent space, the proposed model minimizes the overall overlapping between clusters while improving the cohesion within each cluster. This results in considerable improvements in clustering performance. Since short texts inherently contain both sequential context and localized patterns within their limited context, in this paper a hybrid approach is used by combining both recurrent layers and multi-scale convolutional neural networks to maximize the extractable feature sets from their limited context. This architecture allows us to capture the sequential features and local dependencies by recurrent layer and convolutional layers respectively which leads to generating a more accurate and rich representation for each short text. To evaluate our architecture and because our main focus is on clustering Persian short text, several experiments are conducted in which the results show that the DSN-STC outperforms other approaches in clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) metrics. Also to further test the proposed architecture's generalizability and adaptability in other languages, DSN-STC is evaluated on 2 English benchmark datasets where it consistently outperformed previous approaches in both metrics. These results highlight the model's ability to learn robust and cluster-aware feature representations that are highly useful for effective short text clustering.</description>

The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, and its association with penile cancer stage at presentation has not been studied. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the ADI and advanced-stage disease at diagnosis in penile cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services database of patients aged ≥18 years with penile squamous cell carcinoma from 2004 to 2019. Advanced-stage disease was defined as pathological T stage ≥2, pathological evidence of nodal metastasis, or reported presence of distal metastasis. ADI scores were compared to the national median value. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the ADI and advanced disease after adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Among 353 patients (median age, 72 years; 84.4% White), the median ADI score was 69. Patients were stratified into two groups on the basis of the national median; 76% were in the high-ADI group. Black patients were more prevalent in the higher ADI group (15.3% vs. 2.4%; p = .003). Advanced-stage penile cancer was more frequent in the higher ADI group (49.3% vs. 36.5%; p = .04). In multivariable analysis, each 10-point increase in the ADI was associated with 1.16-fold increased odds of advanced-stage disease (95% CI, 1.04-1.29; p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Greater neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation is associated with advanced-stage disease at penile cancer diagnosis. These findings emphasize the role of social determinants in disease presentation, and may guide targeted interventions in disadvantaged populations.</description>

METHODS: Patients with metastatic cancers receiving oral targeted therapies were randomized (2:1) to a 3-month home-based SPEP (with a coach at home) or recommended adapted physical exercises (booklet). Primary endpoint was feasibility defined as the rate of patients who performed at least 50% of the theoretically planned sessions in the SPEP arm. Main secondary endpoints were fatigue and pain evaluated by VAS scale during the program. RESULTS: Among 112 patients, 74 and 38 were included in the SPEP and control arms, respectively. Median age was 59 (range: 31-83) years and the majority of patients) were women. Main primary tumor location was breast (57%) and kidney (16%). Thirty-three (30%) patients were treated with anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and 53 (47%) received epidermal growth factor receptor or cell cycle inhibitors. Forty-five (61%) patients performed at least 50% of the SPEP. Median fatigue decreased from 4 to 3 (range: 0-10) after 3 months in the SPEP group with maintain of pain control. The percentage of patients with high level VAS of fatigue at 3 months was lower in SPEP arm than in the control arm (27% versus 62%, p-value = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: QUALIOR showed that SPEP with a coach at home was feasible in patients with metastatic cancers treated with oral targeted therapies. This program could mitigate the fatigue induced by oral targeted therapies.</description>

We compared OpenAI's o3 model, which uses an iterative planning loop, with the baseline GPT-4o on 459 oral and maxillofacial (OMF) cases drawn from standard textbooks. Each case consisted of two to five high-resolution haematoxylin-and-eosin micrographs, and both models were queried in zero-shot mode with an identical prompt requesting a single diagnosis and supporting microscopic features. Overall, o3 correctly classified 31.6% of cases, significantly surpassing GPT-4o at 18.7% (Δ = 12.9%, P &lt; 0.001). The largest gain was recorded for the heterogeneous "other conditions" category (37.2% versus 20.2%). For correctly diagnosed cases, o3 generated more detailed descriptions (median Likert score 9 versus 8, P = 0.003). These benefits were offset by longer mean response time (98 s versus near-instant) and lower reproducibility across repeated queries (40.2% versus 57.6%). A board-certified general pathologist achieved 28.3% accuracy on the same image set, underscoring the difficulty of the task. Ground truth was established by two board-certified OMF pathologists with high inter-rater reliability, ensuring the reliability of the reference standard. The general pathologist served only as a non-OMF difficulty benchmark. The findings indicate that advanced reasoning mechanisms materially improve diagnostic performance and explanatory depth in complex histopathology, but additional optimisation is required to meet clinical speed and consistency thresholds. Clinically, such models are adjunctive 'copilots' for preliminary descriptions and differential diagnoses; expert OMF pathologists retain full responsibility for sign-out.</description>

Previous literature has identified a link between the gut and ASD; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been extensively reported in cohort studies of ASD, and specific microbial metabolites or by-products may serve as potential biomarkers for ASD. Additionally, children with ASD often exhibit food refusal, have a limited food repertoire and display a tendency to consume the same foods frequently; thus, these behaviours increase their risk of malnutrition (over-nutrition or under-nutrition) compared to typically developing (TD) healthy children. This study primarily aims to identify oral and gut microbiota among children with ASD and TD healthy children. The secondary aim is to determine the associations between oral and gut microbiota with nutritional status among children with ASD. The findings will enhance understanding of the aetiology of ASD and inform early intervention strategies to mitigate disease severity and early identification of malnutrition in genetically at-risk children. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This observational, age-matched, case-control study is conducted in Malaysia among 40 male children with ASD and age-matched with 40 TD healthy controls aged 4-10 years. The dependent variables include the microbiota profile, identified through metagenomic sequencing analysis of saliva and faecal samples, and autism severity, assessed through validated questionnaires. Independent variables include nutritional status, determined through Subjective Global Nutrition Assessment (SGNA), anthropometry and dietary measurements, gastrointestinal symptoms, eating behaviour, behavioural profile, and sleep quality. Data collection is expected to be completed by June 2026. The study nature may limit causality establishment. Analyses will use chi-square/ANOVA for group comparisons, SparCC for microbiota correlations, and mixed-effects logistic regression to model associations. CONCLUSION: This study advances understanding of ASD-related microbiota, guiding personalised nutrition and precision healthcare in Malaysia.</description>

However, current detection methods experience a marked performance degradation in the presence of deep watermarking within images. In this paper, we propose a multi-module model, which integrates Efficient Multi-scale Attention within Xception as the detection module and introduces a feature dropout module to eliminate redundant image features. Experimental results demonstrate that when 50% and 100% of the images in the dataset contain MBRS watermarks, the accuracy (ACC) metrics of our model are comparable to those of existingbaseline models. However, when 50% and 100% of the images contain FaceSigns watermarks, the ACC metrics of our model outperform those of other baseline models by approximately 10% and 20%, respectively.</description>

Bedaquiline and levofloxacin are the primary drug regimen for MDR-TB treatment in Indonesia. This study aimed to investigate whether the Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline and levofloxacin differs between patients with sputum conversion and those without sputum conversion during the first four months of MDR-TB treatment in Indonesia. METHODS: A cohort study was performed in adult patients (18-65 years old) treated with the 18-24-month oral regimen. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or HIV positive, with uncontrolled diabetes, or had any of the following severe conditions: cancer, digestive, cardiovascular system disorders, hepatic, or renal problems. Two blood samples were collected to measure the plasma concentrations of bedaquiline and levofloxacin using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) isolates from patients' sputum were used to determine the MIC of individual drugs using liquid growth media (MGIT). RESULTS: Among the 74 patients enrolled, 16 dropped out during the four-month follow-up period. Blood samples were successfully obtained 1-2 hours after drug administration from 48 patients and 4-6 hours after drug administration from 32 patients, which were used for pharmacokinetic analysis. Sputum conversion was detected in 84.5% of patients during four months of the MDR-TB treatment. The mean Cmax/MIC ratio of bedaquiline was higher in the sputum conversion group compared with the non-conversion group (9.10 vs. 1.65, respectively). Meanwhile, a small difference in the Cmax/MIC ratio of levofloxacin was observed between the sputum conversion group and the non-conversion group; it was not significant (45.64 vs. 41.72, respectively; p = 0.941). CONCLUSIONS: Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline was higher in MDR-TB patients with sputum conversion compared to those without conversion within the first four months of treatment, suggesting a potential relationship between Cmax/MIC of bedaquiline and sputum conversion, which was not seen in the levofloxacin cases. However, the application of clinical practice should be carefully considered and supported by further study in various settings.</description>

As China's highest national authority organ, the National People's Congress (NPC) plays an important role in China's development. The trust of the Chinese public for the NPC objectively reflects the level of trust by the Chinese public and their confidence in the people's congress system. METHODS: Based on Chinese general social survey (CGSS) 2021 data and using SPSS22 software, this paper examines the impact of public Internet use on political trust through binary logistic analysis and ordinal regression analysis methods. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Research showed that the use of the Internet and its use frequency does not affect public's responsiveness to political trust questions, but the use of the Internet affects the political trust level of the public. People who do not use the Internet at all and those who use the Internet daily are significantly different, and the former hold a higher political trust level than the latter. Moreover, the level of trust of people using the Internet several times per week is markedly lower than that of daily Internet users; no significant differences were found in the level of trust of people using the Internet several times a year or less, several times a month, and daily.</description>

Optimizing inhaled medication delivery to both regions remain a therapeutic challenge. This study evaluates the ability of orally inhaled aerosol particles to achieve dual‑site deposition in SGS and bronchopulmonary regions. STUDY DESIGN: Computational modeling of orally inhaled drug particle delivery. SETTING: Academic Medical Center. METHODS: Digitally modified airways simulating 8 SGS variants, combining McCaffrey Stage I (5 mm) and II (15 mm) subglottic lengths with Cotton‑Myer Grade I (10%, 30%), Grade II (60%), and Grade III (90%) luminal constrictions. Oral inhalation at 15 L/min and particle transport were simulated for fluticasone propionate (FP; mean aerosol velocity 9.19 m/s, particle size range 1-8 μm) and ciclesonide (CIC; mean aerosol velocity 4.26 m/s, particle size range 1-4 μm) inhaler characteristics, and 6 particle‑size distributions M1(1-5 μm), M2(6-10 μm), M3(1-10 μm) while maintaining the respective parent (CIC and FP) mean aerosol velocity. RESULTS: In the normal airway, CIC and FP inhalers achieved &gt;80% bronchial deposition but ≤0.02% subglottic delivery. Among modified devices, M2CIC optimized dual targeting, providing the highest subglottic deposition (0.09%) with preserved bronchial efficiency (69.46%). In SGS models, M2CIC and M2FP consistently achieved the most balanced delivery, with maximum deposition of M2CIC = 8.4% and M2FP = 7.86% at subglottic region, and M2CIC = 69.89% and M2FP = 61.02% at bronchial site. M3 variants offered intermediate dual deposition at advanced and Grade III stenosis stages. CONCLUSION: M2CIC and M2FP inhaler modifications optimized dual-site supporting tailored device strategies for SGS with coexisting bronchopulmonary disease.</description>

METHODS: A systematic review and arm-based Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted searching PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases. Aspirin (ASA), dextran, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), intravenous or subcutaneous unfractionated heparin (IV UFH, SC UFH), prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) were compared with no prophylaxis. Primary outcomes were total and partial flap loss, vascular complications, hematoma, and reoperation. RESULTS: Fifty-four studies (17 773 patients) were included. IV UFH significantly increased hematoma risk (OR 4.18, 95% CI 1.36-13.22) and LMWH modestly raised reoperation rates (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.00-5.01). No regimen consistently reduced flap loss or thrombosis compared with no prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: Antithrombotic agents showed limited benefit in reducing flap-related complications. These findings support individualized prophylaxis and highlight the need for prospective studies to inform evidence-based guidelines.</description>

The relationships between nasal anatomy, inspiratory airflow and olfaction remain unclear, including if nasal anatomic and functional factors account for some variabilities in odor identification in the absence of sensorineural defects. This preliminary study aimed to analyze olfactory cleft airflow dynamics using computational modeling techniques and to develop linear regression models linking smell identification scores to nasal anatomy and computational-derived functional metrics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational fluid dynamics modeling was used to generate nasal airflow-related parameters based on radiographic images of 10 subjects with varying olfactory acuity, but without prior nasal surgery or nasal deformity. Olfaction was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (SIT). RESULTS: Average olfactory airflow volume comprised only 2.43% of total nasal airflow volume. Higher olfactory resistance demonstrated strong associations with higher SIT scores. No one particular anatomic or functional parameter correlated strongly with SIT score. However, the 3-parameter linear regression model comprising bilateral nasal surface area-to-volume ratio, bilateral nasal resistance and olfactory resistance accounted for 82% of the variations in SIT scores (P = .01). Among 2-parameter linear regression models, the model comprising bilateral nasal surface area-to-volume ratio and bilateral nasal resistance accounted for 52% of SIT score variability (P = .08). DISCUSSION: These findings demonstrate that a significant portion of variability in SIT scores can be explained by the combination of nasal resistance, olfactory resistance, and nasal surface area-to-volume ratio, suggesting that nasal anatomy and airflow-related quantities contribute toward variability in olfaction.

We present a rare case of an expansile tumor within the right thyroid ala that was suspected to represent a chondrosarcoma but was found on pathology to represent a hemangioma. Imaging and pathologic features are reviewed as well as approach to resection and reconstruction. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old male presented with progressive neck fullness and decreased vocal range. He was found to have an expansile mass within the right thyroid ala with associated supraglottic fullness on flexible laryngoscopy. Initial primary differential consideration was chondrosarcoma versus chondroma. He underwent open resection with reconstruction of the right thyroid ala using a rib graft and titanium plate which was used to secure the graft to the contralateral thyroid ala and the ipsilateral inner thyroid perichondrium. Intraoperative frozen sections indicated atypical cartilage cells, but final histopathology revealed a hemangioma with suspected reactive changes in the thyroid cartilage. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with rare presentations of hemangiomas in atypical locations, such as the thyroid cartilage. It is one of the first reports of hemangioma occurring within the thyroid cartilage. Excision with reconstruction using a rib graft can be employed for large thyroid cartilage tumors.</description>

METHODS: A cross-sectional, within-subject study was conducted during a CME-accredited national frontal sinus surgery simulation course. Participants completed pre- and post-course surveys rating potential deterrents to FSS. Paired statistical analyses assessed changes in deterrent ratings, and correlational analyses evaluated relationships with surgical experience and case volume. RESULTS: Twenty-eight participants completed both pre- and post-course surveys. Mean time in practice was 14 years, with an average FSS volume of 2 cases per month. Baseline deterrence was moderate (mean 5.10/10), driven primarily by concern for skull base violation and technical difficulty. Following simulation, overall deterrence decreased significantly by 1.27 points (to 3.83; P &lt; .05), with 7 of 9 deterrents showing significant reduction. The largest improvements were seen in apprehension regarding skull base injury, technical challenge, and adequacy of dissection. Factors related to operative time and prior experience showed minimal change. Case volume correlated with lower baseline and post-simulation hesitancy for select deterrents, while years in practice and interval since last FSS did not. All participants reported improved confidence, and the majority anticipated increased incorporation of FSS into their practice. CONCLUSIONS: Simulation-based CME significantly reduced modifiable deterrents and improved confidence among practicing otolaryngologists performing FSS, regardless of years in practice. These findings support simulation as a valuable adjunct for ongoing professional development, enabling experienced surgeons to recalibrate risk perception, refine technical judgment, and support lifelong surgical learning.</description>

TAS-117 is an oral, selective, non-adenosine triphosphate-competitive allosteric AKT inhibitor that showed encouraging antitumor activity in a phase I study. This phase II study aimed to evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity of TAS-117 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, including those harboring germline PTEN-inactivating mutations (EudraCT: 2020-004770-22). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, single-arm phase II study, the 3 + 3 phase I-like dose escalation lead-in part A enrolled patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors irrespective of gene alterations (all-comers). Patients received TAS-117 once daily (o.d.) or intermittent dosing (ID) regimens (4 days on/3 days off), with a 16-mg/day o.d. or 24-mg/day ID starting dose. The primary objective was safety and to define maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (RP2D). The dose/regimen confirmation part B was to further assess RP2D in patients harboring germline PTEN mutations. RESULTS: Overall, 17 patients were enrolled in part A (all-comers n = 16, dose and regimen confirmation, n = 1). Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in three patients [febrile neutropenia at 20 mg o.d. (n = 1); grade 3 oral mucositis at 28 mg ID (n = 2)]. Most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) (all grade/grade ≥3) were rash (58.8%/17.6%), fatigue (35.3%/1%), pruritus (29.4%/0%), hyperglycemia (29.4%/1%), and decreased appetite (17.6%/0%). RP2D was determined to be 16 mg/kg o.d. Seven patients had stable disease. One of two patients with a germline PTEN mutation (metaplastic breast cancer) had stable disease ongoing for 19.1 months as of the data cut-off. The study was closed due to enrollment challenges in the germline PTEN mutation carrier population. CONCLUSIONS: TAS-117 at the RP2D of 16 mg o.d. was tolerable, with a manageable safety profile. Clinical benefit, although durable, was only observed in a single patient with a germline PTEN mutation.</description>

METHODS: The survey, held in Taiyuan, Shanxi from Sep-Dec 2023, gathered demographic details and KAP scores through questionnaires. RESULTS: Out of 500 questionnaires analyzed, 173 respondents (34.6%) were 40 years of age or older. The median knowledge, attitude, and practice scores were 13.00 [9.00, 15.00], 32.00 [29.00, 33.00], and 45.00 [34.00, 50.00], respectively. Multivariate logistic regression indicated that higher knowledge scores (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: [1.00,1.15], P = 0.042), higher attitude scores (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: [1.18,1.40], P &lt; 0.001), having a Master’s degree or higher (OR = 3.98, 95% CI: [1.49,10.62], P = 0.006), a monthly family income of at least 5000 Yuan (OR &lt; 1, P &lt; 0.005), and being employed in professions other than full-time parenting or medical roles (OR &lt; 1, P &lt; 0.005) were all independently associated with better practices. Structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrated that knowledge directly influenced attitudes (β = 0.304, P &lt; 0.001), attitudes directly influenced practices (β = 0.349, P &lt; 0.001), and knowledge indirectly affected practices through attitudes (β = 0.106, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Parents demonstrated adequate knowledge, positive attitudes, and proactive practices regarding the impact of children’s oral habits on the development of the orofacial system. Enhancing parental education programs could further amplify knowledge and promote even more proactive practices in safeguarding children’s orofacial health.

Patients with unresectable, metastatic disease are candidates for approved agent targeted therapies such as vandetanib, cabozantinib, or selpercatinib, but toxicity is often an issue. Preclinical data supported the potential use of immunotherapy targeting carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in this indolent disease. METHODS: Patients with advanced/recurrent MTC were randomly assigned into a 1:1 ratio to receive a saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast)-based immunotherapy (GI-6207) targeting CEA starting at the time of enrollment or 6 months after surveillance. The primary endpoint was to compare the calcitonin growth rate in the GI-6207 arm at 6 months, with patients in the surveillance arm at 6 months. RESULTS: Between March 2013 and May 2018, 34 patients were randomly assigned to receive yeast-CEA vaccine (GI-6207) starting at the time of enrollment or 6 months after surveillance. Mean age was 51 years, and 82% of patients were diagnosed with sporadic MTC. There was no significant change in the calcitonin growth rates at 6 months when the immunotherapy group was compared with the surveillance group (-2.490042 vs. -2.526385; p = 0.3760). Treatment with GI-6207 was associated with increased peripheral CEA specific CD4 and/or CD8 T cells, with15/26 (58%) patients displaying increases after 3 months of treatment. One patient had a significant inflammatory event 17 months after the last vaccine at a known lymph node, perhaps related to a delayed immune response. There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events. Grade 1 injection site reactions were most common. CONCLUSION: The immunotherapy was well tolerated, but did not have an impact on tumor growth rate at 6 months as measured by calcitonin kinetics.

In prostate cancer, they may help overcome AR resistance mechanisms at the ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is the binding site of approved androgen receptor pathway inhibitors like enzalutamide. Masofaniten (EPI-7386) is a next-generation aniten with promising activity and safety in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, phase II, single arm, single-institution trial, patients with treatment-naïve metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) were enrolled in a Simon 2-stage study design to receive the combination of masofaniten 600 mg BID and enzalutamide 160 mg daily with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The study was designed to enroll 35 patients (13 patients in stage 1, then 22 patients in stage 2). The trial would move to stage 2 if 9 or more subjects achieved a biochemical response at 6 months. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were screened and enrolled into stage 1. Five were African American, and eight were Caucasian. The median age was 68 years (range 52-75) at time of enrollment. Median follow-up time was 9.9 months (range 7.7-13.6). Ten of 13 patients (77% with 95% confidence interval [CI]: 50% - 92%) achieved a PSA &lt;0.2 ng/mL at 6 months, achieving the threshold to move on to stage 2. Only one patient had disease progression to mCRPC and died of disease at the time of data cutoff. Patients continued enzalutamide and ADT after trial closure. CONCLUSION: The combination of masofaniten and enzalutamide for treatment-naïve mHSPC did show efficacy and had an acceptable safety profile. These results support further investigation of the dual AR blockade in mHSPC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06312670).</description>

METHODS: Sixty-six adults with allergic rhinitis and fourty five normophonic adults without allergic rhinitis were included in the study. Medical history, skin prick test, endoscopic nasal examination, Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), laryngeal imaging, Acoustic Voice Quality Index (AVQI), Cepstral Peak Prominence Smoothed (CPPS), aerodynamic measurements (/a/,/s/,/z/ and s/z ratio), Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), Vocal Tract Discomfort Scale (VTD), Vocal Fatigue Index (VFI), Reflux Finding Score (RFS), Reflux Symptom Index (RSI), and auditory perceptual assessment (GRBAS) tools were used for evaluation. RESULTS: Allergic rhinitis is associated with adverse effects on the vocal tract, with discomfort increasing as the severity of rhinitis worsens. CONCLUSION: Voice-protective practices appear important to minimize the risk of dysphonia in patients with allergic rhinitis.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate and contrast treatment findings between VFSI and voice therapy for VFNs. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 50 female patients with VFNs received either percutaneous intralesional triamcinolone injection or Accent method voice therapy. Serial evaluations-including videoendoscopic (nodule size, mucosal wave, glottic gap), subjective (auditory perceptual assessment, Voice Handicap Index), and objective (acoustic, aerodynamic) measures-were conducted at baseline and at 1 week and 1-, 2-, 3-, and 6-months post-treatment. RESULTS: Both groups demonstrated significant reductions in nodule size and improvements in mucosal wave patterns and glottic gaps over the 6 months (p &lt; 0.05). Most subjective and objective measures also enhanced significantly in both groups over the same study period (p &lt; 0.05). However, voice therapy outperformed VFSI in most parameters (videoendoscopic, subjective, and objective) by the end of the third month (p &lt; 0.05) and in nodule size reduction by the sixth month (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS: VFSI is a rapid and reliable therapeutic solution for VFNs with outcomes comparable to voice therapy. Long-term data, however, demonstrate voice therapy better prevents nodule recurrence. Therefore, subsequent voice therapy or repeated injections may enhance the long-term efficacy of VFSI.</description>

The objective of this study was to introduce a transoral submandibular surgical technique that has not been previously described in the literature. This technique was compared to the classic Sistrunk procedure and the vestibular approach, which is preferred in endoscope-robot-assisted methods. METHOD: The present study encompasses a cohort of 12 patients diagnosed with TGDC between 2011 and 2022, who underwent surgical intervention utilizing the transoral submandibular approach technique. The transoral submandibular technique is described in detail and compared with the classical transcervical technique and other transoral approach techniques. These comparisons are discussed in the light of current literature. RESULTS: The total number of patients included in the study was 12, with ages ranging from 4 to 17 years. The duration of symptoms ranged from 6 to 120 months. The surgical duration ranged from 80 to 180 min, with an average of 102 ± 14.5 min. No intraoperative complications were observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: The development of minimally invasive techniques has emerged as a response to the external incision scar problem associated with the Sistrunk procedure, the prevailing treatment for TGDC. These techniques hold considerable promise, yet the optimal technique remains elusive. It is hypothesized that the transoral submandibular approach for thyroglossal duct cyst excision will make a positive contribution to the literature in this context.</description>

While previous studies have reported disruption of bee gut microbial communities following pesticide exposure, the effects of short-term sublethal exposure in stingless bees remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (LC50/100 and LC50/1000) on the midgut microbiota composition of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Using metabarcoding of the V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA to characterize bacterial community composition and diversity, we analysed midgut bacterial communities of bees collected directly from hives (T0 group) and after 24 and 48 hours of oral imidacloprid exposure. Our results showed that, after 24 and 48 hours of exposure, there were no significant changes in midgut bacterial diversity or composition between bees exposed to sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid and their respective controls. In contrast, we observed clear differences in both diversity and abundance between the T0 group and control groups, especially after 24 hours of incubation. These differences were primarily associated with shifts in Acetobacteraceae family, likely reflecting the influence of the artificial sucrose diet provided under laboratory conditions. It is important to note that our findings pertain only to acute effects. Future studies would benefit from extending the duration of exposure and including a broader range of toxicological endpoints to build on these findings. Our results also underscore the importance of evaluating both exposure period and dietary conditions when investigating pesticide impacts on bee microbiota.</description>

Preclinical studies suggest that this may result from inflammation-induced destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in vessel wall inflammation assessed using [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after ICI initiation. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma who received at least one cycle of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor avelumab and underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT before initiation of treatment and after 3 months. The primary outcome was the change in the target-to-background ratio (TBRmax) in the descending aorta between baseline and first follow-up scan. Secondary outcomes included the change in TBRmax in the carotid arteries, spleen, and bone marrow, and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included (66% male; median age 75 years). Most patients had established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (62%). The [18F]FDG TBRmax in the descending aorta increased from 1.52 (IQR, 1.39-1.70) at baseline to 1.64 (IQR, 1.41-1.97) after 3 months of treatment (change 7.8%. p = 0.022). No significant changes were observed in the carotid arteries, bone marrow, and spleen. Statin use was not associated with an attenuated change in TBRmax. During a median follow-up of 2.3 (IQR, 1.5-4.2) years, one nonfatal ischemic stroke occurred. CONCLUSION: Avelumab treatment was associated with an increase in [18F]FDG uptake in the descending aorta after 3 months of treatment, which may be a potential marker of inflammation-driven accelerated atherosclerosis in patients receiving ICIs.</description>

The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib using a pooled analysis of patients with CCA from the RAGNAR and LUC2001 studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In RAGNAR (phase 2, global, tumor-agnostic study) and LUC2001 (an open-label, multicenter, phase 2a study in Asian patients), patients with advanced solid tumors after ≥1 prior lines of therapy received once-daily oral erdafitinib (8 mg/day with an option for pharmacodynamically guided up-titration to 9 mg). Patients were pooled for efficacy (objective response rate [ORR] per a blinded independent review committee, duration of response [DOR], progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) and safety analyses. RESULTS: At a median efficacy follow-up of 14.7 months in 78 erdafitinib-treated patients (RAGNAR: n=66; LUC2001: n=12), ORR was 55% (95% CI: 43.4-66.4). Median time to response was 1.7 months; median DOR, PFS, and OS were 6.9 (95% CI: 4.37-8.61), 8.5 (95% CI: 6.83 -9.72), and 18.1 (95% CI: 13.40-24.28) months, respectively. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83%), stomatitis (72%), diarrhea (68%), dry mouth (51%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (51%); 42% had serious TEAEs, and 12% had TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analyses confirm the robust efficacy of erdafitinib in a diverse population of pretreated patients with advanced/metastatic CCA harboring prespecified FGFR alterations. These findings are consistent with previously observed efficacy of FGFR-targeted agents in patients with CCA.</description>

We previously reported a randomized trial targeting women who had not attended screening after &gt;10 invitations, where sending of self-sampling kits resulted in a 19% attendance and a positive predictive value (PPV) for high grade lesions (HSIL+) of 40%, despite no triaging after the HPV test. Because of the striking results, the intervention was extended to all women resident in Stockholm County, Sweden, in the years 2019/20, who had not attended screening &gt;10 years (N = 42,409). Participation was 35.6% and 11.6% of the participating women were HPV-positive. Among these, there were 43 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 319 cases of high-grade lesions. The PPV was particularly high for HPV16/18 positive women (12% for invasive cancer and 59% for HSIL). In summary, participation with HPV self-sampling among long-term non-attenders in the real-life program was considerably higher than in the research setting and the high yield of HSIL+ implied high effectiveness.</description>

His thyrotropin (TSH) worsened to &gt;100 mIU/L, caused by encapsulating sclerosing peritonitis that led to thyroxine malabsorption and enteral loss of protein-bound thyroxine. Several routes of levothyroxine were evaluated prior to subcutaneous levothyroxine. Methods: Subcutaneous levothyroxine was initiated at a low dose of 100 mcg thrice a week. A pharmacokinetic absorption study was performed to assess the bioavailability of subcutaneous levothyroxine against oral levothyroxine. Results: A 103% increase in free thyroxine at 6 hours post-subcutaneous levothyroxine 100 mcg confirmed effective absorption. Area-under-curve analysis showed that the relative bioavailability of subcutaneous levothyroxine was 8.75 times of oral levothyroxine for our patient. Hence, subcutaneous levothyroxine was initiated, with TSH normalizing 20 days later. Conclusions: Subcutaneous levothyroxine may be an alternative in patients with oral malabsorption.</description>

More recently, it has come back into favor for treating venous congestion of surgical sites; however, there is limited data on the number of leeches and application techniques for the head and neck region compared with other anatomical subsites. PURPOSE: This study's purpose was to assess the response to leech therapy in a series of patients with venous congestion, review the literature to determine association between leech therapy use and venous congestion, and provide guidelines for leech therapy for use in the head and neck region. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series of patients treated by the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery for venous congestion with leech therapy at Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA, was analyzed from 2016 to 2019. All nonleech cases were excluded. Literature review articles were gathered from PubMed and Scopus using the search terms leeching and venous congestion using the Boolean operator and. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The main outcome variable in this study was tissue loss in reconstructive sites of the head and neck, defined as no tissue loss, partial tissue loss, or complete loss of tissue. COVARIATES: Covariates included age, gender, medical comorbidities, type of operation required, and chief complaint. Number of leeches used, duration, and antibiotic prophylaxis agents were also gathered. Data gathered from articles included in the literature review included study design, population, number of leeches used, duration, complications, and amount of tissue lost or salvaged. ANALYSES: Descriptive statistics were calculated for data gathered from patient cases. RESULTS: Seven cases were reviewed with a mean age of 60.86 years. Five (71%) subjects experienced venous congestion resulting from resection or reconstruction of malignancy and 2 (29%) after laceration repair. Three subjects (43%) had complete recovery from venous congestion following leech therapy. Four subjects (57%) had partial (minor) tissue loss secondary to necrosis. No subject had complete loss of tissue. From the article review, 16 articles were identified, consisting of 3 systematic reviews, one literature review, and 13 retrospective case series ranging from 6 to 277 cases. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Leech therapy is a viable treatment option for venous congestion. Patients should be screened for coagulopathy, use of blood thinners, and psychological acceptance to therapy prior to initiating leech therapy; antibiotic prophylaxis is essential for preventing infection with Aeromonas hydrophila.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ren C, Chen J, Mao J, Zhang J, Li Z, Wu K, Cheng J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1733152'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1733152&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41476586/'&gt;41476586&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Hypoxia increases resistance to carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) in locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC, stage II-III). This study aimed to develop a hypoxia-related model based on 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for the early prediction of tumor response to CIRT in LA-NSCLC patients, thereby identifying patients most likely to benefit from CIRT. METHODS: A total of 42 LA-NSCLC patients, including 25 (60%) with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 17 (40%) with non-SCC, underwent 18F-FMISO PET/CT prior to CIRT. 18F-FMISO maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax), the tumor-to-muscle ratios (TMR), and hypoxic tumor volume (HTV) were measured, with the TMR ≥ 1.4 threshold defined for hypoxia. The study endpoint was tumor response to CIRT at 3 months. After identifying 18F-FMISO biomarkers related to CIRT response, a prediction model was developed and evaluated using the area under curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval [CI]). RESULTS: Among the 42 patients analyzed, 17 (40%) achieved partial response (PR) while 25 (60%) had stable disease (SD). 18F-FMISO-PET detected obvious uptake in 31 (74%) patients with LA-NSCLC, although these values were not related to CIRT response (p &gt; 0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that favorable responses were significantly more prevalent in hypoxic SCC (TMR ≥ 1.4, n = 15, 36%) patients with smaller HTV (p &lt; 0.01), whereas 18F-FMISO uptake was not significantly correlated with CIRT response in normoxic SCC (TMR &lt; 1.4, n = 10, 24%) or all non-SCC (n = 17, 40%) patients (all p &gt; 0.05). A positive correlation between tumor size and hypoxia was observed in SCC patients (p &lt; 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that HTV was an independent predictor of CIRT response (p = 0.04, odds ratio = 1.14) with an AUC (95% CI) of 0.89 (0.71-1.00) in hypoxic SCC patients. CONCLUSION: 18F-FMISO PET/CT is recommended for SCC patients, especially who are likely to have hypoxia predicted by tumor size, and it holds great promise for selecting patients who will benefit from CIRT.</description>

The high prevalence of HIV further complicates outcomes, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Hyperthermia has emerged as a valuable adjunct to treatment in high-income countries, particularly for locally advanced cancers such as cervical and head and neck tumours, which are common in resource-constrained settings. Uptake of hyperthermia in LMICs has however been limited. A phase III randomised controlled trial in a South African public hospital demonstrated that modulated electro-hyperthermia (mEHT), a capacitively coupled heating technique, was feasible in this setting. The trial, the first to assess hyperthermia in Africa and to include HIV-positive participants, found that adding mEHT to chemoradiotherapy significantly improved 5-year disease-free survival (32% vs. 14%; HR:0.73; 95%CI:0.53-1.00; p=0.049); reduced recurrence, and improved quality of life without increasing toxicity. Benefits were observed equally in HIV-positive and HIV-negative participants. A cost-effectiveness analysis indicated an 82.2% probability of cost savings over three years, primarily due to fewer recurrences and residual disease and improved quality of life. Given its affordability, ease of integration, and lack of additional toxicity, mEHT represents a promising adjunct to chemoradiation in LMICs. Further replication in LMICs beyond sub-Saharan Africa is needed to confirm generalisability to diverse healthcare settings.</description>

It is a deadly disease and is rarely cured when diagnosed at advanced stages. Early-stage disease is often curable, but clinicians and researchers have been stymied in their attempts to reliably screen for this disease, even in high-risk populations. Effective prevention of ovarian cancer is usually limited to the use of combined oral contraceptives and removal of the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Methods and Results: We aim to review the current guidelines and the evidence reported for both the early detection and prevention of ovarian cancer. Novel imaging techniques, biomarkers, and surgical advances will be discussed. Conclusions: This review will offer (a) an understanding of the epidemiology of EOC (b) analysis and a discussion of relevant molecular markers that might be exploited for more accurate early detection (c) medical and surgical methods to prevent ovarian cancer.</description>

METHOD: This study retrospectively collected clinical data from treatment-naïve patients with unresectable T1-4N0-3M0 stage ESCC who underwent induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by radiotherapy at the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between December 2021 and May 2024. Patients were stratified into two cohorts: the early radiotherapy cohort (early-RT, n=34), who initiated radiotherapy after completion of 1-2 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy, and the late radiotherapy cohort (late-RT, n=44), who initiated radiotherapy after completing 3-6 cycles of induction chemoimmunotherapy. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with safety serving as the secondary endpoint. RESULT: With a cutoff date of May 31, 2025, the median follow-up duration was 25.9 months. In the overall population, the median PFS was 16.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.7-20.3) and the median OS was 25.0 months (95%CI, 21.49-28.51). PFS was significantly longer in the early-RT cohort than in the late-RT cohort(20.4 vs. 13.7 months; HR = 0.53; p = 0.032). No statistically significant difference in OS was observed between the two cohorts (26.6 vs. 24.8 months; p = 0.728). Subsequent consolidative immunotherapy significantly improved PFS (median not reached [NR] vs. 12.8 months; HR = 0.46; p = 0.011) and OS (NR vs. 24.1 months; HR = 0.43; p = 0.017). In terms of safety, most treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were grade 1 or 2 in severity and were manageable. The incidence of toxicities did not differ significantly between the early-RT and late-RT cohorts (p &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with unresectable locally advanced ESCC, the combination of early radiotherapy intervention and subsequent consolidative immunotherapy may represent a potential preferred therapeutic strategy. The findings from this study provide a rationale for the design of phase III clinical trials.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Best DL, Yau V, Farsio F, Markiewicz MR&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.007'&gt;10.1016/j.joms.2025.12.007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478302/'&gt;41478302&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is common in patients with repaired cleft palate. Speech surgery, which encompasses operative procedures to improve velopharyngeal function and speech resonance, has been associated with postoperative obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, the relative risk of OSA between different speech surgery procedures remains unclear. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the relative risk of OSA following pharyngeal flap versus nonpharyngeal flap procedures, which included dynamic sphincter pharyngoplasty (DSP), Furlow palatoplasty, and buccal myomucosal flaps (BMMF). DATA SOURCES: An electronic literature search was conducted utilizing PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included patients with a history of repaired cleft palate and VPI requiring speech surgery, published between 1994 and 2024. Studies specifically included comparison data between pharyngeal flap and nonpharyngeal flap techniques. Exclusion criteria were case reports, abstracts, and reviews. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were extracted per the the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Demographics, speech procedure data, OSA frequency, and follow-up data were recorded. The primary comparison was procedure type including pharyngeal flap versus nonpharyngeal flap procedures. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model, with P values &lt;.05 considered statistically significant. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURE: The primary outcome was relative risk of postoperative OSA between procedure types. RESULTS: Four studies met inclusion criteria, which included 751 subjects. Pharyngeal flap was associated with a significantly greater risk of postoperative OSA compared to nonpharyngeal flap procedures (pooled risk ratio = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.20 to 5.01, P = .01). Subgroup analysis showed that palatal lengthening procedures had a significantly lower risk of OSA than pharyngeal flap (risk ratio = 0.39, P = .002); however, there was no difference in postoperative OSA between DSP and pharyngeal flap (P = .68) CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Palatal lengthening procedures had a lower risk of postoperative OSA than pharyngeal flap. There was no difference in postoperative OSA between pharyngeal flap and DSP. As such, in patients with preoperative OSA or patients at high risk for developing OSA, it may be prudent to use palatal lengthening procedures as a first-line option for the correction of VPI.</description>

Standard hysterectomy may constitute overtreatment. Fertility-sparing approaches, oral or local progestins, hysteroscopic resection, and combined regimens are widely used, though evidence largely derives from early-stage carcinoma. Methods: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched from inception to 13 April 2025. Eligible studies included premenopausal women with AEH treated with oral progestins, levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs), hysteroscopic resection, or combination regimens (e.g., oral progestins + metformin, LNG-IUD + GnRH analogues). Random-effects meta-analyses with multilevel modeling were applied. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB-2 and ROBINS-I; certainty of evidence was graded with GRADE-PRO. Results: Forty-nine studies (2313 women) were included. The pooled complete response (CR) rate was 85% (95% CI 80-89%). LNG-IUDs resulted in 88% CR and oral progestins in 80%. Combination therapies achieved up to 95% CR, though data were limited. Hysteroscopic resection combined with hormonal therapy reported high CR rates (96-97%) but relied on small, heterogeneous cohorts with uncertain reproducibility. The pooled recurrence rate was 19% (95% CI, 13-25%), lower with LNG-IUDs (14%) compared with oral progestins (22%). No response occurred in 14% overall and was lower with LNG-IUDs (13%) than oral progestins (19%). Among women attempting conception, the pooled pregnancy rate was 41%, and the live birth rate was 30%. The mean time to achieve CR was 5.6 months, whereas the mean time to recurrence was approximately 33 months. Conclusions: LNG-IUDs provide the most effective and well-supported fertility-sparing treatment for AEH, ensuring high remission with low recurrence. Despite favorable numerical outcomes, the evidence for hysteroscopic resection is limited and inconsistent, not supporting its routine use. Combination regimens may improve response but require confirmation in larger studies.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Clinical evaluations and epithelial cell smears were done on ventral tongue, buccal, and labial mucosa before treatment (T0), after 30 (T30), and 120 days (T120) of PrEP use. Clinical changes were assessed using questionnaires and oral examinations, and a descriptive analysis was performed. Cellular changes were observed through liquid-based exfoliative cytology, and the Wilcoxon and McNemar tests were applied. RESULTS: Sixty-three patients (60 males, 3 females; mean age 29.65) were included; 36 returned at T30 and 20 at T120. Most frequent complaints were dry mouth and increased fluid intake. Wilcoxon test showed no systematic observer error (P &gt; .05). Karyomegaly increased significantly in all sites at T30 and in ventral tongue and buccal mucosa at T30 and T120 (P &lt; .05). Keratinization increased significantly in buccal mucosa at T30 and ventral tongue at T30 and T120 (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate an increase in oral epithelial changes during the first 30 and 120 days of PrEP use. Although these changes are nonspecific, continuous oral health monitoring may support early detection of alterations and adherence among patients on HIV PrEP.</description>

The standard management of locally advanced disease includes neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) followed by surgery. However, the role of esophagectomy in patients achieving clinical complete response (cCR) after nCRT remains uncertain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study at the Davidoff Cancer Center, Rabin Medical Center (2013-2023). Patients with thoracic EC (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) stage cT2-4a, N+, M0 who received nCRT (cisplatin/5-FU or CROSS regimen with 41.4-50.4 Gy) were included. Patients with cCR, defined by negative biopsies, endoscopic ultrasound, and PET-CT, were managed with surgery or surveillance. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. RESULTS: Of 252 patients treated with nCRT, 118 achieved cCR. Seventy underwent surgery, with 47% (33 patients) achieving pathological complete response (pCR), and 48 were managed with surveillance. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 48% with surveillance and 49% with surgery; disease-free survival (DFS) was 36% vs. 43%. No significant differences were observed in OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI 0.47-1.26) or DFS (HR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.55-1.41). In patients ≤70 years, surgery conferred an OS and DFS benefit (HR = 0.44, p = 0.03). No benefit was observed in patients &gt;70 years, where outcomes trended against surgery. On multivariable analysis, older age (p = 0.005) and female sex (p = 0.007) were independent predictors of OS. CONCLUSIONS: In younger patients (≤70 years), surgery yielded significant survival benefit, supporting its role as the preferred treatment. In patients &gt;70 years, surveillance produced comparable or superior outcomes, suggesting deferral of surgery may avoid morbidity without compromising survival. Age-specific tailoring of management is essential.</description>

However, variations in prescribing and inter-assay TSH variability may result in over or undertreatment. METHODS: We measured TSH in 220 consecutive DTC patients using three automated immunoassay platforms (Elecsys, Atellica, Alinity). Each patient was assigned to a response-to-therapy category (Excellent Response [ER], Indeterminate Response [IndR], Biochemical Incomplete Response [BIR], Structural Incomplete Response [SIR]) by an experienced thyroid oncologist. We defined recommended TSH targets according to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 guidelines and the response-adapted ATA 2025 framework that allows progressive relaxation of TSH suppression in patients with ER while maintaining tight suppression in those with persistent disease. Analytical agreement between assays was assessed using Passing-Bablok regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Clinical appropriateness was evaluated by classifying each measured TSH value as below, within, or above the recommended range for that patient's response category. RESULTS: The three immunoassays demonstrated high analytical agreement with only minor biases unlikely to affect clinical interpretation. However, significant deviations from guideline-defined TSH targets were observed. Among ER patients, 37% remained oversuppressed despite the absence of active disease. Conversely, in IndR or BIR patients, 76% had TSH levels above the recommended range, indicating undersuppression where residual disease could not be excluded. SIR patients were generally managed appropriately. The ATA 2025 framework reclassified more ER patients as appropriately managed, but undersuppression persisted in non-ER patients. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines are not uniformly applied in thyroxine dosing for DTC patients. TSH immunoassays have achieved adequate analytical performance. The focus must now shift toward addressing clinical, educational, and systemic factors that prevent optimal levothyroxine management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Romeo E, Markopoulos GS, Vartholomatos G, Voulgaris S, Alexiou GA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17243898'&gt;10.3390/cancers17243898&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41463149/'&gt;41463149&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Purpose: The aim of this review is to evaluate the role of intraoperative flow cytometry (IFC) in tumor surgery. Methods: The Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane databases were searched up to 21 June 2025 to identify all available studies that met the inclusion criteria for final evaluation. To assess the risk of bias and applicability concerns, the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used. Results: A total of 22 studies involving 1511 patients with various tumor types were analyzed to assess the utility of IFC in the rapid diagnosis of tumors. The studies investigated IFC's role in tumor grading, margin delineation, prognostic evaluation, and in differentiating neoplastic from benign lesions, as well as normal from cancerous tissues. In brain tumors, particularly gliomas and meningiomas, IFC demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with reported sensitivities ranging from 61% to 100% and specificities from 66% to 100%. Studies on non-brain tumors also showed high accuracy in distinguishing neoplastic from normal tissues, with sensitivities and specificities exceeding 85% in most cases. The most promising results were observed in brain tumor surgery, although its application in other tumor types continues to expand. Conclusions: IFC appears to be a valuable intraoperative tool in surgical oncology, providing rapid results within minutes and assisting in surgical and therapeutic decision-making. Nonetheless, studies remain limited, and further research is needed, particularly for non-brain tumors, to establish standardized cut-off values and enhance diagnostic reliability.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cole JB, Hurreh KM, Taghizadeh LA, Laudenbach AP, Olives TD, Miner JR, Driver BE&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.51683'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.51683&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41468014/'&gt;41468014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Best-practice guidelines recommend oral medications for treating agitation in the emergency department (ED). However, there is limited study of their use in the ED, especially in the setting of drug and alcohol intoxication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the implementation of oral medications to treat agitation in an ED in which intramuscular medications were standard and to increase the use of oral medications to treat agitation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This quality improvement study analyzed 2 populations. First, all ED patients in an urban level 1 adult and pediatric trauma center from January 1, 2018, to May 31, 2024, were studied to compare the preintervention and postintervention periods. Second, during the 12-month implementation period from September 16, 2020, to August 31, 2021, patients were prospectively observed in an area of the ED dedicated to caring for patients with drug and alcohol intoxication. EXPOSURE: Oral medications to treat agitation, including olanzapine and lorazepam, were encouraged via education and real-time feedback for ED staff. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients receiving their first sedating medication via the oral route. Secondary outcomes included data on time to adequate sedation and adverse drug events. RESULTS: Of 460 600 ED encounters (median patient age, 38 years [IQR, 27-55 years]; 57.8% men; 184 050 [40.0%] before the intervention, 276 550 [60.0%] after), the proportion of patients receiving any sedating medication was similar between time periods (11.8% before intervention vs 11.5% after). The proportion of patients receiving their first sedating medication via the oral route increased after the intervention (7.2% vs 31.4%; difference, 24.2 percentage points [pp] [95% CI, 23.6-24.8 pp]). Among 1178 patients receiving sedating medications during implementation (860 [73.0%] with alcohol intoxication; median breath or blood concentration, 0.22% [IQR, 0.16%-0.28%]), 630 (53.5%) were offered oral medication, of whom 446 (70.8%) accepted it. Time to adequate sedation was 15 minutes (IQR, 7-33 minutes) for oral and 15 minutes (IQR, 9-26 minutes) for intramuscular medications (median difference, 1 minute [95% CI, -0.6 to 2.6 minutes]). There were no significant differences between routes in rates of additional rescue medications (oral, 31.8%; intramuscular, 28.4%; difference, 3.4 pp [95% CI, -2.0 to 8.8 pp]) or adverse drug reactions (oral, 2.7%; intramuscular, 1.1%; difference, 1.6 pp [95% CI, -0.1 to 3.3 pp]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this quality improvement study, emergency physicians successfully adopted oral medications for treating agitation, primarily from intoxication. No difference was found in time to adequate sedation when oral or intramuscular medications were used as primary therapy. These data support best-practice guidelines that suggest oral medications should be first-line treatment for agitation in the ED.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Leonardi N, Gilligan G, Piemonte ED, Panico RL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.11.009'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.11.009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Nov-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41456990/'&gt;41456990&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) is a complex oral condition for which no global consensus on management currently exists, underscoring the need to establish internationally accepted therapeutic protocols. The use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and the adjunctive administration of pentoxifylline and tocopherol (PenTo) have shown promising preliminary results in the clinical management of MRONJ; however, robust data remain limited. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes of surgically treated patients with stage I and II MRONJ, incorporating PenTo as an adjuvant to platelet concentrate therapy. Furthermore, the study seeks to evaluate both clinical and radiographic outcome variables throughout the follow-up period. METHODS: A controlled pharmacological clinical trial was conducted, using a standard drug regimen as the comparator. Total 20 patients diagnosed with stage I or II MRONJ were allocated into 2 groups: one group received surgical treatment combined with PRF, while the other underwent the same protocol supplemented with an adjuvant therapeutic regimen based on PenTo. Participants were recruited from the Oral Medicine Department, School of Dentistry, Universidad Católica de Córdoba. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the mean duration of antiresorptive therapy, which was notably longer in patients with osteoporosis (P = .01). Zoledronic acid was the most frequently associated drug (P = .0019). The addition of PenTo to the treatment protocol was associated with improved clinical and radiographic outcomes, with statistically significant differences (P = .0138 and P = .0046, respectively). Furthermore, the diagnostic stage (I or II) showed a significant correlation with clinical improvement following treatment (P = .0294). The healing index at 15, 90, and 180 days was higher in the group receiving PenTo, with statistically significant differences at each time point (P = .0441; P = .0001; P = .0018, respectively). In oncological patients, the healing index was also higher at all follow-up stages, with clear statistical significance (P = .0294; P = .0004; P = .0042). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes with patient-based evidence to support the interdisciplinary management of MRONJ. The combination of surgical treatment, PRF, and PenTo may serve to optimize and enhance clinical strategies for this condition.</description>

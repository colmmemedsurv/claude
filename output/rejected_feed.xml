      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hoshino M, Sakata K, Kajiwara S, Mihashi R, Ohkubo T, Hashimoto A, Otsu Y, Ono T, Umeno H, Morioka M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09945-1'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09945-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41521199/'&gt;41521199&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Endoscopic endonasal treatment for petrous apex cholesterol granuloma (PACG) allows for natural drainage to the nasopharynx. The high postoperative recurrence rate of PACG is a problem, and a method of permanent drainage is desirable. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to investigate which techniques can achieve permanent drainage. METHODS: We report new symptomatic PACG cases treated by endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization using a nasoseptal mucosal flap (NSMF). To verify the safety, efficacy, and long-term preventive effect on recurrence using an NSMF during endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization, a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Wiley Online Library, and Cochrane Library databases. RESULTS: Over 5 years of follow-up, our two patients, who each developed hypoglossal nerve palsy and abducens nerve palsy, experienced maintained patency to the sphenoid sinus and complete recovery of their symptoms. The systematic literature review of endonasal transsphenoidal marsupialization for PACG revealed that the use of an NSMF was the most effective surgical procedure in select cases. The 5-year estimated recurrence-free survival rates were 46.0% in the simple drainage group, 80.7% in the drainage using stenting group, and 97.1% in the drainage using an NSMF group. CONCLUSION: Transsphenoidal marsupialization using an NSMF may prevent recurrence or stenosis of the opened orifice of the PACG cavity, whereas simple drainage often leads to recurrence. However, more importantly, this approach should be limited to cases in which wide or safe fenestration to the sphenoid sinus can be performed.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kozak KJ, Wadwhani N, Johnston D, Maddalozzo J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70364'&gt;10.1002/lary.70364&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41521399/'&gt;41521399&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: First branchial cleft anomalies (FBCAs) are the result of misguided embryologic development of the external auditory canal, resulting in a partial duplication of the structure. A recent consensus statement by the International Pediatric Otolaryngology Group (IPOG) reclassified lesions based on anatomic location rather than the classic germ cell layer classification. Type I FBCAs are external and superficial to the parotid fascia, and type II FBCAs are juxtaposed to, or involving, the parotid gland. The consensus statement supports extensive resection to prevent recurrence. We hypothesized that type II FBCAs may be multicentric. The objective of this study was to search for histological evidence of this characteristic which, if present, supports the recommendation of the IPOG consensus for extended surgical resection. METHODS: Archived histopathologic resections of type II FBCAs were evaluated for satellite lesions or filamentous tracts off the main lesion indicating respiratory epithelium and extension of pathology beyond the typical resection. RESULTS: Pathologic analysis identified 22 archived tissue specimens with adequate histology to evaluate for the presence of FBCA tissue in the parotid gland. 6/22 (27.3%) demonstrated FBCA tissue external to the main lesion or multiple epithelial rests of similar tissue outside the primary lesion consistent with pathology beyond the primary cyst itself. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the notion that type 2 FBCAs are extensive and can be multicentric. These findings also support the clinical experience and recommendation of the IPOG consensus statement for a more extensive dissection and removal of surrounding tissue in the effort to best prevent recurrence.</description>

The Phase 3, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-month, randomized clinical trial, MODIFY (NCT03425539), aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of lucerastat in adults with FD with moderate-to-severe neuropathic pain. The single-arm, open-label extension (OLE) (NCT03737214) evaluated the longer-term safety and tolerability of lucerastat over 72 months. Lucerastat 1000 mg twice daily (n = 80), compared with placebo (n = 37), failed to affect neuropathic pain at Month-6, with no significant difference between treatment groups (LSM difference -0.42 [95% CI -1.23, 0.40], p = 0.32) (primary endpoint). In contrast, a decrease in baseline plasma Gb3 was observed at Month-6 in lucerastat-treated participants but not placebo-treated participants (LSM difference -873.53 ng/mL [95% CI -1097.53, -649.53], p &lt; 0.0001; NS due to hierarchical testing). In an unplanned OLE Month-18 interim analysis, the eGFR slope (mL/min/1.73m2/year) in 93 participants with pre- and post-randomization (23-month median lucerastat exposure) eGFR data was -3.50 (-5.04, -1.969) and -1.48 (-2.64, -0.33), respectively. Lucerastat was safe and well tolerated. Lucerastat's strong pharmacodynamic effect did not translate into an effect on neuropathic pain. The potential effect of lucerastat on renal function requires further investigation (Trial registration NCT03425539, NCT03737214; 2017-003369-85, 2018-002210-12.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hayes H, Lenze N, Ritz HJ, Pandian V, Brenner MJ, Yalamanchi P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/00034894251409704'&gt;10.1177/00034894251409704&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41518225/'&gt;41518225&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To characterize contemporary workforce trends among physician assistants in otolaryngology-head &amp; neck surgery in the United States. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of annual survey of the Society of Physician Assistants in Otorhinolaryngology-Head &amp; Neck Surgery (SPAO-HNS) data, collected 2015 to 2024. The survey captured self-reported practice patterns, compensation models, and clinical responsibilities. Statistical analyses included linear and logistic regressions to evaluate temporal trends and differences by practice setting. RESULTS: A total of 1227 survey responses were analyzed. Most respondents were physician assistants (93.7%), predominantly working in private stand-alone otolaryngology practice environments (66.8%). Majority of respondents reported working an average of 40 hours per week with salary-based compensation (71.8%), though productivity-based bonuses rose over the study period (P =&lt; .001). Common procedures performed independently included cerumen removal, foreign body extraction, and nasal endoscopy or flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy. Practice setting influenced patient volume and scope of responsibilities, with stand-alone practices reporting higher outpatient volumes. The proportion of respondents planning to leave otolaryngology within 5 years nearly doubled from 17% in 2015 to 29% in 2024. CONCLUSION: This 10-year longitudinal analysis highlights the integral and evolving contributions of physician assistants and nurse practitioners to otolaryngology care across diverse practice settings. The findings document an expanding role in enhancing access to care and performing office procedures independently. However, the rising proportion of respondents intending to leave the field signals emerging workforce sustainability challenges. Proactive strategies to support recruitment, retention, and professional development are needed to ensure a stable and effective otolaryngology workforce capable of meeting growing patient needs.</description>

METHODS: Adults who underwent office-based transnasal double balloon dilations of the PES at a single academic institution over a 3-year period were retrospectively studied. Clinicodemographic data, prior PES dilation history, procedural indications, pre-procedure anxiolytic usage, procedural data including the number of office-based double balloon dilation procedures performed and dilation diameter, complications, and subjective outcomes at 2 weeks post-dilation were recorded. RESULTS: Nineteen office-based double balloon dilations to 24 mm (12 + 12-mm balloons) were performed in seven patients (mean age: 65.3 years, 57.1% female). Indications for dilation were varied. Two (28.6%) patients had a history of oropharyngeal cancer treated with radiation therapy. No patients were post-laryngectomy. The majority (85.7%) of patients underwent at least one prior in-office transnasal single balloon dilation. Two (28.6%) patients required a pre-procedure anxiolytic. One complication occurred involving post-procedure epistaxis that resolved with topical oxymetazoline application. No esophageal lacerations or perforations were encountered. No procedures required early termination due to poor patient tolerance. The majority (71.4%) of patients reported subjective improvement in dysphagia symptoms at 2-week follow-up. CONCLUSION: Double balloon dilation of the PES is feasible in unsedated patients in the office setting.</description>

Distinguishing between the two can be challenging when serum calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels are severely elevated. Carcinomas classically present with markedly increased values and more severe clinical symptoms. METHODS: Clinical data was obtained via retrospective chart review and literature review. RESULTS: Three cases of female patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism with markedly elevated PTH levels (755-3547.4 pg/mL) underwent uncomplicated parathyroid adenoma excision with no histopathologic evidence of malignancy. Appropriate intraoperative reduction in PTH levels was observed, and all patients experienced normalization in calcium levels postoperatively. There is a notable deficit in available literature regarding similar cases. CONCLUSIONS: Given the rarity of parathyroid carcinoma, these exceptional cases and laboratory values serve as a valuable reminder for clinicians about the diverse presentations of adenomas.</description>

Advances in systemic therapy have altered the role of RT as preoperative therapy in patients with resectable esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, RT continues to play a central role in nonoperative management for patients with squamous cell carcinoma with mounting evidence in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. The combination of RT with immune checkpoint inhibitors remains an area of promise and ongoing investigation. In addition, ablative RT continues to show its utility in the management of patients with oligometastatic disease. Herein, we present a contemporary critical review of the evolving role of RT in esophageal cancer including as perioperative therapy, in combination with immunotherapy, its role in nonoperative management including the role of RT dose escalation in patients with cervical esophageal cancer, and its utility in the management of patients with oligometastatic disease.</description>

METHODS: Systematic scoping review. MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and CINAHL were searched from inception to December 2024 for cancer survivorship studies conducted in Australia, with studies reporting data for people with advanced or metastatic cancer classified using NCI's priority research themes. RESULTS: We identified 483 studies, of which 72 (14.9%) recruited and reported data for participants with advanced or metastatic cancer, focusing on: psychosocial research (51.4%); healthcare delivery (16.7%); health behaviors (12.5%); symptom management (11.1%); and epidemiology and surveillance (8.3%). Most were conducted within individual Australian states (72.2%) and involved multiple cancer types (41.7%). Study designs included qualitative (44.4%), cross-sectional (34.7%), cohort (16.7%), case-control (1.4%), case report (1.4%) and mixed methods (1.4%). Forty-two tumor-specific studies were identified including breast (33.3%), hematological (21.4%); prostate (11.9%); bowel/colorectal (11.9%), gynecological (9.5%), melanoma (7.1%), head and neck (2.4%), and lung (2.4%) cancers. Nearly a quarter of studies recruited participants via cancer registries (22.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Few cancer survivorship studies included people with advanced or metastatic cancer in Australia. We offer six recommendations to support funders, clinicians, policymakers, and researchers to improve representation of advanced or metastatic cancer survivors in survivorship research programs. Similar efforts in other countries are needed. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Increasing numbers of people are living long-term with advanced or metastatic cancer.

Phage therapy offers a promising alternative treatment strategy against biofilm-associated infections, though its use remains mostly ad hoc and typically considered a last-resort intervention. We report here the treatment of a refractory, fluoroquinolone non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa VGI using a systematically planned and synergistic phage-antibiotic combination approach. Adjunctive phage therapy led to radiological improvement, as seen by reduced 18F-FDG PET/CT tracer uptake around the graft. The patient was transitioned to oral fluoroquinolone suppression therapy with no recurrence of bacteremia to-date, after a year. Our workflow led to the selection of phages that sensitized Pseudomonas aeruginosa to killing by levofloxacin and piperacillin-tazobactam. We established that this phage-driven antibiotic sensitization was due to the ability of our phages to use the MexAB-OprM efflux pump as a receptor. We also showed that our phages had potent anti-biofilm activity. We advocate a systematic, multi-pronged management strategy for refractory VGIs, including early therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), in vitro antibiotic combination testing (iACT), and timely adjunctive phage therapy. This case illustrates the utility of individualized, strategic approaches and highlights adjunctive phage therapy's potential in treating complex biofilm-related infections.</description>

The transcription factor KLF5 is frequently genomically amplified and activated in multiple epithelial cancers, highlighting the need to define its role in the transformation of normal epithelium to cancer. Here, we used genetically engineered organoids to identify the function of KLF5 in tumorigenesis of multiple endodermal epithelial cancers. KLF5 activation drove a series of morphological and molecular events during the stepwise transformation of normal airway epithelium towards lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) by remodeling protein biosynthesis and energy metabolism. Inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation attenuated the malignant progression of LUSC driven by KLF5. In summary, this study identified KLF5 as a crucial transcriptional modulator in LUSC oncogenesis and indicated that KLF5-activated LUSC may be therapeutically vulnerable to inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation.</description>

Medical cannabis has shown promise for symptom management, yet high-quality data are lacking because of regulatory barriers in conducting cannabis research. Partnering with state cannabis programs may represent a novel pathway to conduct cannabis trials. METHODS: We conducted a pilot randomized waitlist-controlled trial of medical cannabis for 32 patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced/metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma with ≥1 symptoms in Minnesota. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to early (0-8 weeks) or delayed (9-16 weeks) cannabis intervention (certification, education, provision of cannabis products) through the Minnesota Medical Cannabis Program. The primary study period was 0-8 weeks when only the early arm received the intervention. The primary outcome was feasibility. Secondary outcomes included acceptability, and changes in symptom burden and quality of life examined in exploratory efficacy analyses. RESULTS: We enrolled 34 patients, 32 of whom began the study (median age 71 years, 53% women). Patients reported substantial moderate-to-severe baseline symptom burden: insomnia (85%), pain (77%), and appetite loss (69%). The study met prespecified feasibility benchmarks (74% enrollment (goal ≥20%), 81% compliance with arm allocation (goal ≥60%), and 75% patient-reported outcome completion rate [goal ≥50%]). All early arm participants recommended the intervention to others. The median daily tetrahydrocannabinol use was 7.3 mg at 8 weeks. At 8 weeks, early arm patients experienced numerically higher rates of improvement in pain (44% v 20%, P = .35), appetite (56% v 30%, P = .37), and insomnia (67% v 30%, P = .18), and lower rates of worsening cannabis-related harms (eg, dry mouth [11% v 20%, P = .99]). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a model collaboration between investigators and a state cannabis program to overcome regulatory barriers to conducting interventional cannabis research. The encouraging preliminary efficacy and safety of cannabis in managing symptoms supports further exploration.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational clinical study of 11 individuals (16-30 years) with confirmed clinical or genetic ED diagnosis. Only periodontally healthy patients were included. Assessments comprised Plaque Index and modified Gingival Index, Probing Depth (PD), Bleeding on Probing (BoP), Gingival Phenotype, Widths of Attached Gingiva (AGW) and Keratinized Mucosa (KMW). A histological sample of keratinized gingiva was obtained from a single patient to complement the clinical evaluation. RESULTS: A consistently thin gingival phenotype was found, with medium/thick tissues confined to isolated molars. AGW and KMW were within ranges but unevenly distributed; several mandibular areas showed reduced or absent attached gingiva. Some sites with minimal AGW lacked recession, suggesting a congenital condition. Gingival fragility and translucency complicated standard indices, potentially overestimating PD and BoP. Histology showed epithelial projections into the submucosa and poorly organized connective tissue with loosely arranged collagen and loss of normal supracrestal orientation. Scattered epithelial nests and ectopic enamel matrix deposits are visible within the submucosa. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with ED may exhibit soft-tissue features and periodontal architecture distinct from typical patterns, supporting the need for tailored clinical assessment and potentially modified diagnostic criteria.</description>

Rapid cSCC develops in melanoma patients on BRAF inhibitors due to paradoxical MAPK activation. To model this in mice, we use two complementary approaches: HRASG12V with a BRAF inhibitor to mimic paradoxical MAPK activation, and BRAFV600E, which drives MAPK hyperactivation without further treatment. We target these mutations to the interfollicular stem and differentiation-committed progenitors of the basal epidermis. While stem cells rapidly form tumours, progenitors exhibit long-latency resistance despite retaining mutations and repopulating the basal layer. Ultimately, both populations produce similar tumours, showing a shared transformation process. However, SOX2 is uniquely upregulated in progenitor-derived tumours and is expressed in 20% of human cSCC, indicating it might mark tumours arising from committed progenitors. Here, we show that SOX2 overexpression, along with MAPK activation, in progenitors induces a stem-like state and renders this otherwise resistant population permissive to rapid transformation.</description>

This is the first medicinal product in Europe for pharmacological management of VHL, a rare, hereditary condition characterized by the development of multiple tumours across various organs. Belzutifan is an oral inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factor-2α (HIF-2α), a protein involved in the pathogenesis of VHL-associated tumours. This approval, which is based on the results of the pivotal Phase 2 clinical trial MK-6482-004 (LITESPARK-004) 1,2,3 offers a therapeutic approach to managing certain VHL disease-associated tumours. This article describes the clinical data supporting belzutifan approval, in the EU, focusing on the VHL disease indication and its mechanism of action.</description>

Among epigenetic modifiers, histone demethylases like KDM4C (lysine demethylase 4C) play a pivotal role in tumor progression by removing repressive methylation mark at Histone H3K9/H3K36 and altering chromatin structure and gene expression. Overexpression of KDM4C has been implicated in various malignancies, including breast, prostate, colorectal, and hepatocellular carcinomas, hence it is promising drug target. This study employs a structure-based drug discovery strategy to identify natural polyphenolic inhibitors of KDM4C. High-throughput virtual screening, followed by molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM-GBSA free energy calculations, used to assess binding potential. Pectolinarin and compound 202 emerged as top candidates, outperforming the reference ligand (6X9) used from PDBID: 5KR7, in docking scores, and exhibiting robust hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions within the active site. MD simulations over 200 ns confirmed complex stability, indicated by consistently low RMSD and RMSF values. MM-GBSA analysis revealed strong binding affinities with free energy values of -68.4 kcal/mol and -65.7 kcal/mol for Pectolinarin and compound 202, respectively. ADMET predictions supported their drug-likeness, suggesting favorable pharmacokinetic profiles, oral bioavailability, and low toxicity. These findings highlight pectolinarin and compound 202 as promising leads for KDM4C-targeted cancer therapy. Further experimental validation is required to confirm their efficacy and specificity. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of computational approaches in advancing the discovery of nature-derived epigenetic therapeutics.</description>

Recently, research has sought objective biomarkers, like salivary microRNAs, to improve concussion management. However, significant limitations hinder the use of microRNAs as a diagnostic tool, including the cumulative effects of a contact sport season. A better understanding of the response to a contact sport season would help researchers and clinicians interpret expression changes at the time of injury in the context of seasonal variation. in Therefore, this study investigated the reliability of previously identified salivary microRNA targets across one contact sport season. METHODS: This longitudinal study involved 50 male NCAA Division I football players (21 ± 1.6 years; 187.5 ± 6.9 cm; 103.1 ± 19.8 kg). Saliva was collected before the season's first contact practice and within 72 hours of the season's final game. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiments were conducted using pre-selected microRNA targets. Non-parametric tests compared expressions between time points (α ≤ 0.05). RESULTS: No significant differences were found between pre- and post-season miRNA (p = .07-.46). However, intraclass correlation coefficients revealed low to moderate reliability across the season (ICC = -.04-.65). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found no significant differences in time points for target microRNA, but ICC statistics indicated low reliability across the season. These findings suggest that microRNA expression may be variable throughout the season regardless of concussive trauma, and clinicians should be aware that changes in microRNA expression should not be directly attributed to concussive forces. Researchers and clinicians should not rely on the presented set of microRNA to make clinical decisions for potential concussive injuries.</description>

However, judging an open crown margin clinically is difficult, and their radiographic assessment is controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate factors influencing interpretation of crown margins to optimize their assessment. Nine plastic KaVo model teeth were divided into three groups (n = 3 per group), and each group received a different margin design (slanted buccal or lingual, concave coronal or convex, 0.7 mm or 1 mm finish line). Zirconia crowns were fabricated, and preparations were exposed to five different radiographic angulations: 1) perpendicular to both the plate and teeth; 2) with 10° of mesial shift; 3) with 10° of distal shift; 4) with +10° vertical angulation; and 5) with -10° vertical angulation. Images were interpreted for open/closed margins by three consultants. Binary logistic regression was used to determine predictors of an open margin, and intra- and inter-examiner reliability was assessed. Overall, closed margins (false negatives) were most detected when the PID was at +10° vertical angulation (72.2% of the time), independent of margin design. Predictors of an open crown margin were position-indicating device (PID) angles at right angles to the tooth and 10° mesial shift when the margin was 0.7 mm. However, it was less likely that a slanted buccal open crown margin would be detected with +10° vertical angulation. The radiographic interpretation of the margins of zirconia crowns is significantly influenced by PID angulation and margin design. A + 10° vertical angulation should be avoided when assessing marginal adaptation, and a convex coronal finish line of &lt;1 mm should be avoided as they are harder to detect radiographically when open.</description>

This systematic review aims to clarify the diagnostic pathway in pSS, with emphasis on the utility of minor salivary gland biopsy. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched up to November 2025. Observational, retrospective, cohort, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports were included. Risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. RESULTS: Thirty-nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Recurrent or persistent parotitis emerged as the most frequent glandular manifestation. The most common extra-glandular features included joint involvement and lymphadenopathy. Serological analysis revealed positivity for anti-SSA in 64% and anti-SSB in 51% of cases, with antinuclear antibodies and rheumatoid factor detected in 69% and 53% of patients, respectively. Minor salivary gland biopsy yielded positive findings in approximately 70% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Minor salivary gland biopsy appears to represent a key component of the diagnostic work-up, particularly in the absence of standardized pediatric criteria. When integrated with clinical and serological findings, it may facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnosis.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ali S, Klassen TP, Candelaria P, Bhatt M, Sawyer S, Stang A, Yaskina M, Heath A, Pechlivanoglou P, Offringa M, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2025.25033'&gt;10.1001/jama.2025.25033&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41505155/'&gt;41505155&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Ibuprofen is first-line therapy for musculoskeletal pain. However, two-thirds of children experience inadequate pain relief with ibuprofen monotherapy, and the efficacy of additive medications for moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether treatment with an opioid (hydromorphone) plus ibuprofen or nonopioid (acetaminophen [paracetamol]) plus ibuprofen decreased pain scores compared with ibuprofen alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled trials were conducted from April 2019 to March 2023 in 6 university-affiliated, tertiary care Canadian pediatric emergency departments. Children aged 6 to 17 years presenting with a nonoperative acute limb injury (&lt;24 hours) and a verbal numerical rating scale (vNRS) pain score of 5 or more out of 10 were enrolled. Date of final follow-up was March 22, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: The opioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, or ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial randomized participants to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen alone. In all groups, ibuprofen was dosed at 10 mg/kg (maximum, 600 mg). The acetaminophen dose was 15 mg/kg (maximum, 1000 mg), and the hydromorphone dose was 0.05 mg/kg (maximum, 5 mg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy outcome was self-reported vNRS pain score at 60 minutes post medication administration (score range, 0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain]; minimal clinically important difference, 1.5). The primary safety end point was the proportion of children with any adverse event related to study drug administration. RESULTS: A total of 8098 children were screened for eligibility; 699 were randomized and 653 were included in the efficacy analyses. The opioid trial included 249 children: 110 randomized to ibuprofen plus hydromorphone, 70 to ibuprofen plus acetaminophen, and 69 to ibuprofen alone. The nonopioid trial included 450 children: 225 randomized to a single oral dose of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen and 225 randomized to ibuprofen alone. The mean (SD) age of children in the 2 trials was 11.5 (3.5) years and 47.4% were female. The mean (SD) vNRS score at recruitment was 6.4 (1.8). In pooled analyses, mean (SD) vNRS scores 60 minutes after drug administration were 4.8 (2.6) in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group, 4.6 (2.4) in the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen group, and 4.6 (2.3) in the ibuprofen alone group (P = .78). Any adverse event occurred at higher rates in the ibuprofen plus hydromorphone group (28.2%) compared with the ibuprofen plus acetaminophen (6.1%) or ibuprofen alone groups (5.8%). No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: For children with acute nonoperative musculoskeletal injury, pain scores at 60 minutes after drug administration did not improve with ibuprofen plus acetaminophen or ibuprofen plus hydromorphone compared with ibuprofen alone. Adverse events were 4-fold more frequent with hydromorphone. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03767933.</description>

METHODS: In this prospective, double-blind study, 80 children (6-12 years) scheduled for surgery between January and December 2024 were randomized into a control group and an observation group (n = 40 each). The control group received oral glucose (0.25 ml/kg) before anesthesia; the observation group received oral midazolam (0.25 ml/kg) 20 min prior. Heart rate, SpO₂, Ramsay sedation score, and Parent Separation Anxiety Scale (PSAS) score were measured before medication and upon entry to the operating room. Cooperation, sleep onset time, extubation time, awakening time, and PACU stay were recorded. FLACC pain scores and Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores were assessed at awakening, 5 min after awakening, and on PACU arrival. RESULTS: The observation group had a higher rate of perfect induction (ICC = 0) and lower emergence agitation incidence than controls (P &lt; 0.05). PAED and FLACC scores were lower at all emergence time points. Ramsay scores were higher and PSAS scores lower on entry in the observation group, with significant intra-group changes from baseline (P &lt; 0.05). No differences were found in pre-medication or entry heart rate and SpO₂. Extubation, awakening, and PACU times were longer in the observation group (P &lt; 0.05). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly. CONCLUSION: Preoperative oral midazolam improves induction compliance and reduces ED in pediatric tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, though it prolongs recovery times.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this investigator-initiated, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients with advanced or refractory DTs to receive either PLD (50 mg/m² intravenously) or placebo every 4 weeks for 6 cycles. Crossover from placebo to PLD was permitted upon disease progression. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints were objective response and safety. RESULTS: From November 2020 to March 2023, a total of 73 patients were assigned to receive PLD (49 patients) or placebo (24 patients). With a median follow-up of 16.1 months, PLD had a significantly longer PFS over placebo (not reached vs. 4.3 months), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.05 (95% CI, 0.01-0.17; P&lt;0.001). The 2-year PFS rates were 90.4% with the PLD group and 19.6% with placebo. PFS benefit favored PLD across most prespecified subgroups. The confirmed objective response was observed in 19 (40.4%) patients in the PLD group and 1 (4.3%) in the placebo group (P=0.002). Common grade 3 or higher adverse events with PLD included neutrophil count decreased (10.6%), mucositis oral (6.4%), and white-cell decreased (4.3%). Significant between-group differences in certain patient-reported toxicities were observed (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PLD significantly prolonged PFS and induced durable responses than placebo, with a favorable safety profile, for patients with progressive or symptomatic desmoid tumors.</description>

In this single-arm, phase II trial (NCT04834986), 27 patients with resectable HCC at high recurrence risk received perioperative tislelizumab (anti-PD-1) plus lenvatinib (multi-kinase inhibitor). Co-primary endpoints were safety and feasibility. Secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), 1-year and 2-year disease-free survival (DFS), median DFS, and pathologic complete response (pCR). Post-hoc exploratory machine learning analyses identified potential predictive factors. The regimen was feasible and generally well tolerated; grade 3 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 7.4%. ORR was 55.6%. Among 20 patients undergoing surgery, The Median DFS was 18.8 months (20.1-month follow-up), with 1- and 2-year DFS of 74.0% and 49.8%, and 20% achieved pCR. No unexpected safety signals were observed. The post-hoc machine learning model based on Tabular Prior Data Fitted Network, comprising six pretreatment hematological measures, demonstrated classification of candidate selection in the training set (area under the curve [AUC], accuracy [ACC], and average precision [AP], all 1.0) and the test set (AUC = 0.917, ACC = 0.778, AP = 0.966). In conclusion, tislelizumab-lenvatinib is a potential perioperative regimen for resectable HCC at high recurrence risk, showing preliminary efficacy and safety.</description>

Conventional recurrence-free survival (RFS), calculated from the time of surgery, may underestimate prognosis for patients who remain recurrence-free during the early postoperative years. This study aimed to evaluate conditional RFS and recurrence timing to inform individualized follow-up strategies. METHODS: An individual patient data (IPD) analysis was conducted using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing perioperative treatments for resectable esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer. Conditional RFS, defined as the probability of remaining recurrence-free for an additional y years given x years already survived without recurrence (RFSy|RFSx), was estimated. RESULTS: IPD from 10 phase III and 1 phase II RCTs were analyzed (n = 2268 patients with R0 resection). In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), RFS5|RFS0 was 47.9%, which increased to 63.0%, 72.5%, 78.2%, and 81.2% at RFS5|RFS1-4. Among patients who recurred, 58.8% of pN-positive cases recurred within 1 year and 81.7% within 2 years, compared with 42.8% and 69.9% in pN0. At baseline (RFS5|RFS0), patients with pN-positive disease or pM1 disease had worse 5-year RFS than those with pN0 or pM0 disease. However, among patients who remained recurrence-free for 4 years after surgery (RFS5|RFS4), the pattern was reversed, with advanced groups showing better subsequent 5-year RFS. Similar trends were observed in adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Conditional RFS improves over time, particularly in advanced-stage esophageal cancer. Although advanced cases are typically monitored more intensively, findings suggest comparable follow-up intensity may be appropriate once patients remain recurrence-free for a certain postoperative period.</description>

We report updated overall survival and longer-term efficacy and safety outcomes. METHODS: CARTITUDE-4 is an open-label, multicentre, randomised, phase 3 trial at 81 hospital sites in the USA, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Eligible patients were adults (aged &gt;18 years) with lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma, with one to three previous treatment lines, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. After the trial started, the threshold defining measurable disease was lowered to 0·5 g/dL from 1·0 g/dL serum monoclonal paraprotein on July 2, 2021, to increase trial access. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via a computerised algorithm and balanced with permuted blocks, with stratification by physician's choice of pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone versus daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone, International Staging System stage, and number of previous treatment lines. Patients were assigned to cilta-cel (apheresis, bridging therapy [at least one pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone or daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone cycle], lymphodepletion, then cilta-cel infusion [0·75 × 106 CAR T cells per kg]) or standard of care (pomalidomide-bortezomib-dexamethasone [21-day cycles: 4 mg/day oral pomalidomide on days 1-14; 1·3 mg/m2 subcutaneous bortezomib twice a week for 2 weeks for eight cycles, then once a week for 2 weeks per cycle; 20 mg or, if aged &gt;75 years, 10 mg oral dexamethasone on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 for eight cycles, then days 1, 2, 8, and 9 per cycle] or daratumumab-pomalidomide-dexamethasone [28-day cycles: 1800 mg subcutaneous daratumumab weekly for 2 cycles, every 2 weeks for four cycles, then every 4 weeks; 4 mg/day oral pomalidomide on days 1-21; 40 mg/week or, if aged &gt;75 years, 20 mg/week oral or intravenous dexamethasone]). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, previously published. In this Article, we report a prespecified second interim analysis of overall survival and an updated analysis of progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04181827) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Patients were randomly assigned between July 10, 2020, and Nov 17, 2021, to receive cilta-cel (n=208) or standard of care (n=211). At a median follow-up of 33·6 months (IQR 20·3-35·0), median progression-free survival was not reached (95% CI 34·5 months-not evaluable) in the cilta-cel group versus 11·8 months (9·7-14·0) in the standard-of-care group (HR 0·29 [95% CI 0·22-0·39]). Median overall survival was not reached (95% CI not evaluable) with cilta-cel versus not reached (37·7 months-not evaluable) with standard of care (HR 0·55 [95% CI 0·39-0·79]; p=0·0009). 30 (14%) of 208 patients in the cilta-cel group and 77 (37%) of 208 in the standard-of-care group had maximum grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, most commonly anaemia (72 [35%]) in the cilta-cel group and neutropenia (59 [28%]) in the standard-of-care group. Rates of maximum grade 4 treatment-emergent adverse events were 156 (75%) with cilta-cel and 116 (56%) with standard of care, most commonly neutropenia (152 [73%] with cilta-cel and 112 [54%] with standard of care). Serious treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 98 (47%) patients in each group. Deaths in the safety population occurred in 50 (24%) in the cilta-cel group and 82 (39%) in the standard-of-care group, including due to treatment-related adverse events in six (3%; four due to infection) in the cilta-cel group and five (2%; all due to infection) in the standard-of-care group. INTERPRETATION: The significantly improved overall survival and patient-reported measures in CARTITUDE-4 reinforce the use of cilta-cel in treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma as early as after first relapse.

METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed (1996-February 2025), Embase (1947-February 2025), Web of Science (1997-February 2025), Cochrane Library (1996-February 2025) (pre-inception retroactively indexed studies, January 1900-February 2025); 13 included in our meta-analysis. Stata 18.0 computed pooled RRs (95% CIs); heterogeneity assessed via publication bias, subgroup and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The study incorporated thirteen studies. It is evident that there is a statistically significant correlation between the occurrence of vitiligo and an elevated risk of developing thyroid cancer (RR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.19, 2.12]). Conversely, a significant reduction in risk was observed for overall cancer (RR = 0.77, 95% CI [0.66, 0.90]), cancers of the respiratory system (RR = 0.75, 95% CI [0.66, 0.84]), digestive system (RR = 0.74, 95% CI [0.63, 0.87]), and skin cancers (RR = 0.58, 95% CI [0.36, 0.93]). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a dual cancer risk profile in vitiligo: increased risk for thyroid cancer, but decreased risk for overall cancer, internal malignancies (respiratory and digestive systems) and skin cancers. These findings suggest the potential need for customized cancer surveillance strategies and investigation into preventive interventions.</description>

Traditional therapy relies on oral hygiene instruction (OHI) and risk factor control, though adherence is challenging. This randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Medical Coaching on Oral Health (MCOH) in improving plaque control (PCR) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) after 1 month, compared to conventional OHI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-four patients with periodontitis at the University Hospital of Bari (Italy) were randomized into MCOH (n = 32) and control (n = 32) groups. Baseline assessments included periodontal status, PCR, GBI, and a lifestyle questionnaire (smoking, alcohol, nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress). The MCOH group received personalized sessions, including goal-setting, emotional barrier assessment, and action planning, while the control group received standard OHI. RESULTS: After 4 weeks, the MCOH group showed greater improvements in GBI (-47.5 vs. -24.5, p &lt; 0.001) and PCR (-44.0 vs. -32.0, p = 0.003). The composite clinical outcome was significantly higher in the MCOH group (75.0% vs. 34.4%, p = 0.001). Lifestyle improvement, particularly smoking cessation, alcohol reduction, and stress management, was greater in the MCOH group. MCOH improved periodontal outcomes and promoted healthier lifestyle behaviors compared to OHI. REGISTRATION: NCT06887946.</description>

Here we report the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (NCT04065672) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose interleukin-2 (LD-IL-2) in BS patients. 60 participants with active oral ulcers are randomly assigned to receive LD-IL-2 or placebo. The primary endpoint is the oral ulcer count at week 12. The LD-IL-2 group has significantly fewer oral ulcers than the placebo group (0.69 ± 1.05 vs. 1.57 ± 0.90, P = 0.001) with greater improvements in ulcer pain, disease activity, and quality of life. No infections or severe adverse events are observed in either group. LD-IL-2 expands regulatory T (Treg) cells and decreased the ratio of effector T cell to Treg cells. Thus, LD-IL-2 therapy might be an effective and safe treatment in BS patients and is associated with the modulation of CD4 + T cell populations.</description>

We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ecnoglutide in adults with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or with a single oral hypoglycaemic agent. The primary endpoint was change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) from baseline at week 24. Between 29 December 2022 and 12 June 2024, 211 participants from 32 medical centres in China were randomised (2:2:1:1) to receive double-blind, once-weekly ecnoglutide (0.6 mg [n = 69] or 1.2 mg [n = 71]) or volume-matched placebo (0.6 mg [n = 36] or 1.2 mg [n = 35]) for 24 weeks. The randomisation, stratified by baseline HbA1c (≤8.5% or &gt;8.5%), was conducted via an interactive web response system. Ecnoglutide and placebo were identical in appearance to achieve masking. The trial was completed. All randomised participants received ≥1 dose of the assigned treatment and thus were included for analyses. At week 24, the least squares mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were -1.96% (95% CI -2.18 to -1.73) with ecnoglutide 0.6 mg and -2.43% (95% CI -2.65 to -2.20) with ecnoglutide 1.2 mg versus -0.87% (-1.09 to -0.65) with placebo. The estimated treatment differences versus placebo were -1.09% (95% CI -1.40 to -0.77; p = 0.0003) with ecnoglutide 0.6 mg and -1.56% (95% CI -1.87 to -1.24; p &lt; 0.0001) with ecnoglutide 1.2 mg. Ecnoglutide represents a potential monotherapy option for T2DM. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov with the registration number NCT05680155.</description>

In NCI9673 (Part B), we evaluated the anticytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab for patients with incurable anal cancer. METHODS: In this phase II NCI ETCTN trial, 100 patients with refractory, incurable anal cancer were randomly assigned to receive nivolumab (480 mg IV once every 4 weeks) alone or with ipilimumab (1 mg/kg IV once every 8 weeks). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints included radiographic response, overall survival (OS), and grade ≥3 adverse events. A log-rank test was used to compare survival between arms, with a one-sided alpha of 0.1 and power of 90%. Immune biomarkers were analyzed from baseline and on treatment tissue and blood collections. RESULTS: The median PFS for nivolumab versus nivolumab plus ipilimumab were 2.9 months (90% CI, 1.9 to 3.8) and 3.7 months (90% CI, 2.0 to 5.6), respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.60 to 1.23]; P = .25). Response rates were similar for nivolumab (17.4%) and nivolumab plus ipilimumab (21.5%; P = .89). The median OS was 15.9 months for nivolumab and 20.0 months for nivolumab plus ipilimumab (HR, 0.98 [90% CI, 0.63 to 1.51]). Grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs occurred in 6 patients (12%) receiving nivolumab alone and in 12 patients (25%) receiving nivolumab plus ipilimumab. At week 9, circulating TIGIT+ CD8+ cells (P &lt; .001) increased with nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment relative to baseline. CONCLUSION: The addition of ipilimumab to nivolumab did not statistically improve overall response rate, PFS, or OS but may harbor increased toxicity. Paired blood samples identified TIGIT expression on peripheral T cells as a compensatory change unique to dual PD-1 plus CTLA-4 blockade.</description>

This study aims to describe our standardized VANS procedure for primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and to evaluate its safety and surgical outcomes. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed six patients with PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy using the VANS approach at our institution between January 2022 and December 2024. All patients were diagnosed preoperatively by an endocrinologist. Tumor localization was assessed using computed tomography, ultrasonography, and Tc-99m methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile scintigraphy. Surgical techniques, operative outcomes, and perioperative complications were evaluated. RESULTS: VANS was successfully performed in all six patients, including one upper and five lower parathyroid gland lesions. Tumor size ranged from 7 to 23 mm (median, 18 mm). Operative time ranged from 60 to 177 minutes (median, 116.5 minutes), with minimal blood loss. Intraoperative ultrasonography was useful for tumor identification in selected cases. Complete adenoma resection was achieved in all patients without complications or conversion to open surgery. CONCLUSION: VANS is a safe, effective, and cosmetically favorable surgical option for selected patients with PHPT. With appropriate patient selection and standardized techniques, this approach can be reproducibly performed in centers experienced in endoscopic neck surgery.</description>

RLN injuries are common in this zone during thyroidectomy. This study aims to describe the vascular pattern at the modified P1 zone. METHODS: This prospective analysis included 131 consecutive subjects who underwent thyroid surgery between October 2023 and June 2024. Various clinical, radiological, histopathological and intraoperative parameters were studied. RESULTS: The study included 212 nerves at risk(NAR). The mean age of the study population was 43 ± 12.6 years. Immediate post-operative vocal cord palsy was noted in 3.3% of NAR. 100% of patients had at least one vessel in relation to RLN in the modified P1 zone. The mean number of vessels in this zone was 3 ± 1.2. Type 3 vascular pattern(presence of vessels anterior and posterior to the nerve) was the most common(68.9%). Multivariate analysis showed the presence of Pelizzo grade 2 tubercle of Zuckerkandl (OR 2.4; 95% CI: 1.07-5.37, p = 0.033) and the presence of stage 2 or 3 tumor stage(OR 2.2; 95% CI: 1.10- 4.55, p = 0.026) were independent predictors of the increased number of vessels(&gt; 2 vessels). CONCLUSION: The study describes the consistent vascular pattern and its relationship with RLN in the modified P1 zone. Awareness of this may help surgeons to prevent RLN injury during thyroid surgery and effectively tackle the vessels in modified P1 zone.</description>

METHODS: Forty-four patients received two cycles of induction therapy (paclitaxel plus carboplatin/nedaplatin combined with a PD-1 inhibitor), followed by concurrent radiotherapy with two additional cycles of chemoimmunotherapy and subsequent immune maintenance therapy for up to one year. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS); the secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety, and quality of life (QoL). RESULTS: At the data cut-off point (median follow-up: 25.5 months), both the ORR and DCR were 95.5%. The median PFS was 26 months (95% CI: 14.8-37.2), and the median OS was 29 months (95% CI: 23.0-35.0). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year PFS rates were 75.0%, 51.9%, and 40.4%, respectively, and the OS rates were 81.8%, 63.1%, and 42.0%, respectively. Distant metastasis represented the main failure mode (64.0%). Treatment-related adverse events were generally mild; moreover, 17 patients (38.6%) experienced grade ≥3 events, primarily involving hematologic toxicity (14/17). Severe immune-related adverse events were rarely observed. QoL assessment in surviving patients (n = 21) indicated favorable overall function and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen of induction chemoimmunotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and maintenance immunotherapy demonstrated promising survival outcomes, a manageable safety profile, and a preserved QoL, thereby offering a viable nonsurgical alternative for patients with locally advanced ESCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Boralevi F, Simon G, Bernigaud C, Brun J, Goujon E, Perrot JL, Phan A, Hérissé AL, Maruani A, Vanhaecke C, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2025-086277'&gt;10.1136/bmj-2025-086277&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41494769/'&gt;41494769&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oral ivermectin or topical 5% permethrin can clinically cure scabies in index cases and in members of their households. DESIGN: Multicentre, assessor blinded, cluster randomised clinical trial. SETTING: 28 French hospitals, 19 January 2016 to 16 December 2021. PARTICIPANTS: Index cases; adults and children weighing &gt;15 kg with scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy. INTERVENTIONS: Index cases were randomly assigned to the ivermectin group or permethrin group (1:1 ratio). Each member of the cluster, defined as the household of each index case, received the same treatment as the index case, except for children weighing &lt;15 kg who were prescribed topical 5% permethrin. All participants received oral ivermectin 200 µg/kg or 5% permethrin cream on day 0 and day 10. Permethrin cream was applied to the whole body, from head to toe. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was clinical cure of the cluster on day 28 (ie, disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms of scabies for all cluster members). Secondary outcomes were index case and individual level analyses and safety. Dermatologists were used as assessors and were masked to the treatment. RESULTS: 507 participants in 142 households (clusters) were treated with ivermectin and 568 participants in 147 households received permethrin. Cluster level cure rates were 71.8% versus 88.5% (-16.7 percentage point difference, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.3 to -7.1) for ivermectin versus permethrin. Secondary outcome percentage point differences also showed the inferiority of ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin for index cases (76.6% v 91.5%; percentage point difference -14.9, 95% CI -23.6 to -6.2) and participants (85.3% v 94.2%; -9.2 percentage point difference, -14.9 to -3.5). Intraclass correlation coefficients were higher for permethrin than ivermectin for all clusters (0.68, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.75 v 0.46, 0.37 to 0.56) and for cluster size &gt;1 (0.67, 0.60 to 0.74 v 0.47, 0.37 to 0.56). Cutaneous adverse events were found in 11.9% and 15.6% of participants treated with ivermectin and permethrin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this cluster randomised trial of classic scabies, confirmed by dermoscopy, did not show the non-inferiority of oral ivermectin compared with 5% permethrin cream, given on days 0 and 10, in achieving clinical cure of scabies on day 28 in index cases and their household members. Conversely, the trial showed the statistical superiority of 5% permethrin cream. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02407782.</description>

FAP is typically characterized by the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps throughout the colon and rectum, with a nearly 100% chance of developing CRC if left untreated. Duodenal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer for patients with FAP; however, gastric cancer has become more prevalent in recent years with improved surveillance of the colon, rectum, and duodenum. Patients frequently develop other extracolonic manifestations including desmoid disease, which holds the highest extracolonic mortality risk, and thyroid nodules, which are more frequently associated with the cribriform morular variant of papillary thyroid cancer. Management of FAP is complex, and patients require frequent and lifelong surveillance. This review will discuss the current understanding and clinical management of FAP as well as innovations and challenges in clinical practice.</description>

It primarily inhibits the proliferation of tumor cells by interfering with DNA replication and transcription. CHOP has been approved for the treatment of various types of malignant tumors. The aim of this research is to assess adverse events linked to CHOP using real-world data. METHODS: This research collected and analyzed adverse event reports associated with CHOP from the FAERS(US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System) database spanning from the first quarter of 2004 to the third quarter of 2024. This study leveraged the FAERS database, extracting reports submitted exclusively by healthcare professionals where CHOP was designated as the primary suspect (PS). Four risk signal detection methods were employed: Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Bayesian Confidence Propagation Neural Network (BCPNN), and Multiitem Gamma Poisson Shrinker (MGPS), to conduct a comprehensive analysis of CHOP-related ADRs. RESULTS: A total of 3,625 adverse event reports with CHOP as the primary suspect drug were obtained. Across 25 system organ classes (SOCs), four positive Preferred Terms(PTs) signals were detected. The most significant signal in SOCs was "blood and lymphatic system disorders" (ROR = 6.64, 95% CI 6.49-6.79), while the most significant PTs signal was "high grade B-cell lymphoma Burkitt-like lymphoma recurrent" (ROR = 613.63, 95% CI 123.85-3040.40). CONCLUSION: This study provides compelling evidence of the presence of CHOP seven unexpected off-label AEs were also observed, such as mucoepidermoid carcinoma, hypotelorism of orbit, breakthrough COVID-19, airway remodeling, meningitis enteroviral, acute graft versus host disease, and gastrosplenic fistula. Additionally, the combination of CHOP and radiotherapy increased the risk of several severe AEs, such as hemorrhagic cystitis. These findings highlight the importance of caution when prescribing CHOP to high-risk individuals with a history of meningitis, cystitis or airway obstruction.</description>

Our goal was to develop and validate a new, short patient-reported outcome measure to screen for barriers to daily oral ART adherence in HIV care in Canada and France. The overarching design was that of a multi-phase, multi-site instrument development project. It involved a previously published qualitative research synthesis (to develop a conceptual framework from which to generate items). Here, we present the results of cognitive interviews (for content validity testing of the preliminary items) and of a longitudinal survey-based study where the revised 7-item instrument (the I-Score) was administered at two timepoints (baseline, 4 weeks), along with five indirect measures of ART adherence, including self-reported HIV viral load and, for a subset of Montreal participants, plasma viral load. The survey data was used to analyze the instrument's measurement properties, namely structural validity (e.g., with Pearson inter-item correlations); construct validity, including cross-cultural validity, for a variety of sociodemographic groups (with receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses and areas under the curve (AUC); reliability (with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)); and measurement error (with the standard error of measurement (SEM)). Study participants were adults living with HIV on antiretroviral therapy recruited from hospital-based infectious disease centers and community-based organizations in Montreal, Toronto, and Paris. The qualitative synthesis of 41 studies led to a framework composed of 6 barrier domains. One item was generated per domain. The 6-item measure was submitted to cognitive testing with 12 adults living with HIV, leading to several changes, including the division of one item into two, creating a 7-item measure. Overall, 305 adults living with HIV participated in the survey. Inter-item correlations were low to moderate, suggesting no redundant items. Among conclusive results, AUC's were all above the predefined threshold (≥ 0.70) for self-reported viral load and plasma viral load for the global sample and across all subgroups examined. The ICC, at 0.81, was also above the predefined threshold (≥ 0.70). The SEM was 0.43. Overall, the evidence generated supports the 7-item I-Score measure's content validity, construct validity/cross-cultural validity, reliability, and acceptable measurement error, in its specified context of use.</description>

Key oncogenic viruses that cause solid tumors include high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8), and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy by boosting immune responses against tumors. While viral infection-associated tumors often exhibit "hot" immune profiles, clinical outcomes with ICIs remain inconsistent. Some studies report improved survival in virus-associated cancers, whereas others indicate no clear benefit, which might reflect high variability in tumor microenvironments and immune responses. In this review, we aim to explore the direct and indirect contribution of different viruses to carcinogenesis in solid tumors, with a particular focus on immunotherapy effectiveness based on infection status.</description>

This study explores the relationship between PM2.5 exposure, the oral microbiome, and metabolic biomarkers including ghrelin, resistin, and insulin. METHODS: Data from 473 adult participants (97.7% Black; median age: 53.6) were analyzed. PM2.5 exposure was retrospectively assigned based on residential addresses, metabolic biomarkers were measured from blood samples, and oral microbiome profiles were obtained from saliva samples. Multivariate linear regression, weighted quantile sum regression, and high-dimensional mediation analysis were employed to estimate microbiome-biomarker associations, the association of the oral microbiome mixture, and mediation effects for PM2.5 exposure. RESULTS: A total of 20 oral microbiome taxa were significantly associated with at least one biomarker, with genus Atopobium linked to all three. Insulin demonstrated the strongest sensitivity to the oral microbiome influence. Genera in phyla Actinomycetota and Bacillota played key roles in the relationship between the oral microbiome and metabolic biomarkers. Mediation analysis revealed that the oral microbiome mediated 16.5% and 11.1% of PM2.5's associations with resistin and insulin, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests potential mechanisms regarding how the oral microbiome influences metabolic biomarkers and mediates the metabolic effects of PM2.5 exposure.</description>

Branaplam, an orally available HTT messenger RNA splicing modulator, reduces HTT protein levels in vitro and in animal models, and is the first splicing modulator to be evaluated in individuals with HD. Here we present the design and results of VIBRANT-HD, a randomized phase 2b study of branaplam in HD, along with preclinical findings in nonhuman primates. VIBRANT-HD utilized an innovative study design informed by our preclinical data, including targeted safety monitoring measures (for example, neurofilament light chain measurements in blood, nerve conduction studies), and staggered cohorts to capture potential neurotoxic effects early. Of the 21 participants in the initial cohort receiving branaplam 56 mg weekly, 18 (85.7%) showed at least one sign or symptom of peripheral neuropathy. This safety signal, along with dose-modeling results triggered the early termination of VIBRANT-HD. The primary outcome, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid mutant HTT levels versus placebo, was summarized descriptively, making branaplam the first splicing modulator to lower mutant HTT levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with HD. Increased neurofilament light chain levels observed in most participants reversed after treatment discontinuation. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05111249.</description>

Although 86.7% (26/30) of patients with recurrent CDI did not experience a subsequent recurrence over 8 weeks in an open-label phase 1b study, a subsequent double-blind phase 2 study ( NCT02437487 ) did not demonstrate a significant benefit over placebo (rate of recurrence at 8 weeks in SER-109 versus placebo: 44.1% versus 53.3%). These discordant outcomes were hypothesized to be due to suboptimal dosing. This hypothesis was addressed in a pivotal phase 3 trial ( NCT03183128 ) using an approximately tenfold higher dose. In phase 3, only 12% of VOS-treated patients versus 40% of placebo patients recurred by week 8 (relative risk 0.32, P &lt; 0.001). Here in this follow-up post hoc analysis, across-trial comparisons confirmed that the higher, efficacious phase 3 dose is associated with improved pharmacokinetics, assessed by VOS engraftment (patients with available samples: phase 1b: 28, phase 2: 79, phase 3: 170). In-depth phase 3 analyses revealed that VOS significantly altered microbial composition, significantly enriching the diversity and abundance of Firmicutes species and reducing the prevalence and abundance of C. difficile and opportunistic pathogens (for example, Enterobacteriaceae species). Consistent with these taxonomic changes, significant changes in key bioactive metabolites were observed, including depletion of conjugated and deconjugated primary bile acids, enrichment of secondary bile acids and increases in short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids. In vitro, VOS batches produced these C. difficile-inhibiting metabolites. These findings on the pharmacology of VOS underscore the importance of rapidly restoring key protective functions of the microbiome in patients with recurrent CDI to achieve durable prevention of recurrence, as observed in the phase 3 study; they also highlight the need to include the microbiome in the clinical management of CDI.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Schwarz S, Kummer S, Klang A, Walter I, Nell B, Brandt S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328584'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0328584&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490689/'&gt;41490689&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common malignant tumor disease in horses. It predominantly affects the ocular, oronasal, and anogenital region. Equine SCC is difficult to treat, also because important aspects of SCC development and metastasis are still unclear. We previously provided evidence that equine SCC cells can adopt a stem cell-like phenotype as a hallmark of malignant progression. Here, we investigated whether equine SCCs harbor endothelial-like tumor cells that form an alternative network of pseudo-vessels better known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Following histopathological diagnosis, 43 equine SCCs or precursor lesions (15 ocular, 14 genital, 14 oronasal tumors) were PCR-screened for equine papillomavirus (EcPV) infection. Subsequently, formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE)-sections of all tumors were analyzed by Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for endothelial cell marker CD31. Obtained micrographs were evaluated by a scientific board to unanimously identify sections of intact tumor tissue displaying PAS-positive, CD31-negative lumens harboring erythrocytes. Thirteen lesions exhibiting these features were subjected to triple immunofluorescence (IF) staining for CD31, pan-cytokeratin (KRT) and type 4 collagen (Col4) or alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) to confirm the presence of VM, and to determine whether pericytes have a role in this phenomenon. All genital and 50% of oronasal lesions scored positive for EcPV type 2, whilst ocular lesions tested negative. One mandibular SCC harbored EcPV type 5. Six genital, three oronasal, and four ocular tumors unambiguously exhibited VM as revealed by CD31-/PAS+ vessel-like structures containing erythrocytes, the detection of CD31-negative cells lining their lumens, and the presence of Col4 and αSMA in this lining. Detection of these two proteins in the context of VM suggests that VM-forming cancer cells recruit pericytes to enhance channel formation and stability. To our knowledge, this is the first report providing evidence of VM in equine cancer, and more generally, SCC in animals.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhou Y, Wang B, Song C, Xie W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0335395'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0335395&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490177/'&gt;41490177&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (LUSC) remains a significant challenge in oncology due to limited diagnostic and therapeutic options. Epigenetic regulation and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) play crucial roles in cancer pathogenesis, progression, and immune evasion, making them valuable areas of investigation for understanding LUSC. METHODS: This study integrated data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to identify differentially expressed epigenetics and endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (EERSGs) in LUSC. Using the CIBERSORT algorithm, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were analyzed, and various machine learning and Cox models were employed to filter characteristic and prognostic markers. Further investigations included single-gene analysis, pan-cancer exploration, validation using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database, drug sensitivity analysis, and experimental validation through knockdown models, Western Blot, CCK-8, and Transwell experiments. RESULTS: Our analysis identified ACE and HSPB8 as potential therapeutic targets and prognostic markers in LUSC. A risk scoring system was developed, accurately predicting patient survival outcomes. Low expression groups were associated with decreased immune escape potential, indicating higher efficacy of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Quantitative analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) and functional assays revealed significant differences in the roles of ACE and HSPB8 between normal lung and LUSC cells, underscoring their importance in tumor biology and epigenetic regulation. CONCLUSION: This comprehensive bioinformatics and experimental study highlights ACE and HSPB8 as novel targets for LUSC treatment and prognosis, emphasizing their roles in epigenetic regulation and ERS. The risk model demonstrates preliminary potential for guiding personalized therapeutic strategies, emphasizing the need for a deeper understanding of epigenetic mechanisms and ERS in cancer development and treatment. Thus, our findings open avenues for further research into targeted therapies for LUSC, aiming to improve patient outcomes through precision medicine that considers both epigenetic factors and ERS.</description>

METHODS: A home pharmaceutical care service team was constituted by pharmacists and physicians from the county-level medical community. A home-based pharmaceutical care survey was conducted for patients with long-term oral anticoagulants (VKAs, rivaroxaban, dabigatran and apixaban). The patients' awareness and adherence score to oral anticoagulants(OATs) was evaluated before and after home pharmaceutical care service. The awareness and adherence score were evaluated with awareness questionnaires and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8), respectively. The paired-sample t tests were used to compare the awareness and adherence score. RESULTS: Finally, totally 95 patients completed the survey. Among these patients, 29 patients were in the VKAs group and 66 patients were in the NOACs group. Following the implementation of home pharmaceutical care service, there was an increase in the awareness score, rising from 5.02 ± 1.71 to 8.09 ± 1.25 (p &lt; 0.001). Similarly, the adherence score increased from 4.66 ± 1.66 to 6.94 ± 0.59 (p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates that the home pharmaceutical care service model implemented within county-level medical community for anticoagulation treatment is feasible and shows promise in improving anticoagulation knowledge and medication adherence among patients.The findings provide preliminary evidence for a service model that could be further evaluated. Future controlled studies are warranted to confirm its efficacy and to investigate its impact on clinical health outcomes.</description>

METHODS: Patients with UVFP (n = 54), VF lesions (n = 42), and HVF (n = 41) were retrospectively identified. Image frames and voice samples were extracted from stroboscopic videos. Clinicodemographic variables were collected from the electronic health record. Patient-level data was independently divided into training (80%) and testing (20%). Visual features were extracted using a transformer DINOv2 and acoustic features were extracted using Librosa. All three feature modalities were combined using a custom multilayer perceptron. Unimodality models using only image or only voice data were trained for comparison. Accuracy and F1 scores were used to validate the models. RESULTS: On a hold-out test set, the multimodal classifier demonstrated stronger performance (76.9% accuracy) compared to the image classifier (61.5% accuracy) and audio classifier (65.4% accuracy). On an external dataset, the multimodal classifier accuracy dropped to 45%, though still an improvement compared to accuracies of 42% and 31% for the video-only and audio-only modalities, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this proof-of-concept study, we successfully developed a multimodal dataset and classifier for VF pathology, demonstrating the potential of combining stroboscopic frames, voice and text data. The multimodal classifier achieved higher accuracy than the image-only model and audio-only models. Future models should validate these findings on larger datasets.</description>

METHODS: The connector underwent engineering validation in a laboratory and preclinical testing using a porcine model. A handheld standard stimulator probe served as the control. The experimental group consisted of a long monopolar probe and two connector-adapted probes. Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) and vagus nerves were stimulated to compare the efficacy and safety of the adapted probes with the standard probe. RESULTS: The connector, when coupled to endoscopic instruments, did not show a statistically significant difference in electromyographic (EMG) amplitude at 1 mA stimulation compared with the standard probe. Safety analysis showed no significant hemodynamic effects. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the developed connector, when paired with endoscopic instruments, enables reliable nerve identification and preservation during endoscopic thyroid surgery, with favorable efficacy and safety profiles.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kelleter L, Harrabi S, Ochoa-Parra P, Winter M, Jäkel O, Debus J, Martisikova M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.036'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.036&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41490579/'&gt;41490579&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Ion-beam radiotherapy offers steep dose gradients and high biological effectiveness required for the treatment of complex cancer cases. While the vast majority of ion-beam therapy centers today use protons and carbon ions, there is renewed interest in helium ions for their unique physical and radiobiological properties. All ion-beam treatments suffer from beam-range uncertainties mainly caused by potential changes of the patient morphology. In-vivo treatment monitoring with secondary ions could potentially provide feedback about the treatment quality that would allow a dose reduction in the healthy tissue or an escalation of the tumor dose. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This work presents the first in-vivo monitoring of a helium-ion therapy patient treated for a solitary fibrous tumor. The method is based on the tracking of secondary ions that leave the patient as a natural by-product of ion-beam radiotherapy. RESULTS: The comparison of two measured secondary-ion distributions confirmed a high treatment reproducibility for the reported patient. However, significant differences between the two fractions were detected at the border of the skull base and the sinus sphenoidalis that could originate from potential inter-fractional cavity filling. CONCLUSIONS: The world's first in-vivo monitoring of innovative helium-ion therapy was performed successfully. In the future, the observed signals will need to be validated with patients that receive regular control CTs. Moreover, Monte Carlo simulations and phantom measurements will help to establish a robust link between changes in the secondary-ion distribution and clinically relevant dose changes.</description>

Strategies to improve prescribing are not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a discharge-focused prospective audit and feedback process decreases antibiotic overuse at hospital discharge. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This stepped-wedge cluster-randomized clinical trial was conducted across participating units at 10 hospitals with antibiotic stewardship (AS) teams and supporting staff from December 5, 2022, to November 17, 2023. After a 24-week baseline period, 1 hospital crossed into the intervention arm every 2 weeks. INTERVENTION: The intervention consisted of disseminating institutional guidelines for oral antibiotic step-down to frontline prescribers and conducting a prospective audit and feedback process for inpatients receiving antibiotics with an anticipated discharge date in the next 48 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was postdischarge antibiotic use. Secondary outcomes included inpatient antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, and readmission. Manual electronic health record reviews were performed in 434 cases to assess optimal antibiotic prescribing at discharge for patients who met specific criteria. Analysis was performed on a per-protocol basis. RESULTS: There were 21 842 patient admissions (baseline, 14 288; intervention, 7554) across 10 hospitals. The median (IQR) age was 66 (53-75) years, with 13 380 (61.3%) males. At the hospital level, the mean (SD) number of patients audited by the AS team per week was 19.9 (5.8); approximately one-quarter of these audits (mean [SD], 5.0 [2.6]) resulted in feedback to the frontline prescribers. There were 3133 patients (21.9%) prescribed postdischarge antibiotics at baseline compared with 1645 patients (21.8%) during the intervention (odds ratio, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.84-1.05]). The mean (SD) postdischarge antibiotic duration was 7.1 (5.2) days at baseline compared with 7.6 (5.6) days during the intervention (mean difference, 0.02 [95% CI, -0.50 to 0.53] days). There were no statistical differences during the intervention compared with baseline for inpatient antibiotic duration (mean [SD], 4.4 (3.6) vs 4.2 [3.5] days; mean difference, 0.04 [95% CI, -0.20 to 0.27] days), length of hospital stay (mean [SD], 5.4 [4.8] vs 5.4 [5.0] days; mean difference 0.11 [95% CI, -0.12 to 0.33] days), or hospital readmission within 30 days (odds ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.88-1.18]). Optimal antibiotic prescribing was more common during the intervention (122 of 264 cases [46.2%] vs 100 of 170 cases [58.8%]; odds ratio, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.08-2.40]). A total of 112 inpatient frontline prescribers were sent a postintervention survey; 40 (35.7%) responded, and 34 of 36 (94.4%) believed that the initiative improved antibiotic prescribing at hospital discharge. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this stepped-wedged cluster-randomized clinical trial conducted across 10 hospitals, discharge-focused prospective audit and feedback did not decrease antibiotic use at hospital discharge but did improve optimal antibiotic prescribing for common and uncomplicated diagnoses. Other AS strategies are needed to decrease unnecessary antibiotic prescribing at this transition of care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClincialTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05471726.</description>

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by surgery and surgery with adjuvant therapy (AT) are commonly used approaches. OBJECTIVES: To compare the long-term survival outcomes, safety, and pathological benefits of NCRT followed by surgery vs surgery with AT in patients with locally advanced ESCC, and to evaluate the survival impact of pathological complete response (pCR) in the NCRT subgroup. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This prospective, randomized, open-label phase 3 trial was conducted at Sichuan Cancer Hospital, China, between January 2018 and April 2020. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 75 years; had histologically confirmed, resectable, locally advanced thoracic ESCC, staged as cT1N+M0 or cT2-4aNxM0; were expected to survive more than 6 months; and had adequate organ function. Key exclusion included prior malignant neoplasms, distant or cervical lymph node metastasis, contraindications to surgery, and prior gastrectomy precluding reconstruction. Data were analyzed April to December 2024. INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the NCRT group received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (40 Gy in 20 fractions) with concurrent paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by surgery. Patients in the AT group received an adjuvant chemoradiotherapy regimen designed by a multidisciplinary team. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included disease-free survival (DFS), pathological outcomes, treatment-related toxic effects, and perioperative complications. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients were initially enrolled; after exclusions and randomization, 118 patients in the NCRT group (median [IQR] age, 62 [54-66] years; 102 [86.4%] male) and 112 patients in the AT group (median [IQR] age, 63 [55-66] years; 97 [86.6%] male) were included in the analysis. After a median (IQR) follow-up of 59.1 (54.4-65.9) months, there were no significant differences in OS or DFS between the groups. The 5-year OS rates were 59.2% (95% CI, 51.0%-68.8%) for the NCRT group and 59.6% (95% CI, 51.2%-69.5%) for the AT group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.67-1.51; P = .97). The 5-year DFS rates were 53.1% (95% CI, 44.7%-63.1%) and 56.5% (95% CI, 47.9%-66.7%), respectively (HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.77-1.68; P = .53). Subgroup analysis showed that patients achieving pCR in the NCRT group had significantly improved survival outcomes, with a 5-year OS rate of 76.5% (95% CI, 63.5%-92.1%) compared with 52.1% (95% CI, 42.4%-64.1%) for non-pCR patients (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.82; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial, there were no differences in OS or DFS for patients treated with NCRT followed by surgery or surgery with AT. However, for the patients who achieved pCR with NCRT, there were significant advantages, with markedly improved long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy did not benefit all patients; for those less likely to respond, the combination of surgery with postoperative AT remains a reasonable strategy. These findings show that it may not be appropriate to universally recommend neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for all patients.

Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy (nCIT) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) may improve outcomes, but their long-term efficacy remains unclear. Methods: This multicenter study analyzed LA-ESCC patients from three Chinese hospitals (2015-2024) who received nCIT or nCRT followed by surgery. Primary endpoint was 3-year overall survival (OS); secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), pathologic complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS), and adverse events. Propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics. Results: Among 225 patients (87 nCRT, 138 nCIT), matched cohorts (87 per group) showed that nCRT had higher ORR (85.06% vs. 45.98%), T/N downstaging rates (78.16% vs. 58.62%; 85.06% vs. 45.98%), and pCR (37.90% vs. 14.90%) (all p &lt; 0.01). After median follow-up (nCIT: 44.5 months; nCRT: 35.1 months), nCIT improved 3-year OS (75.90% vs. 55.60%) and DFS (66.40% vs. 47.30%) (p &lt; 0.05). Subgroup analysis favored nCRT in N+ or non-cT4 disease. Clinical N stage independently predicted survival. Conclusion: nCIT demonstrates superior survival benefits in LA-ESCC, while nCRT may be more effective for N+ or non-cT4 patients. Further randomized trials are warranted.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate whether sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) improved liver-related outcomes in patients with chronic viral hepatitis and co-existing diabetes. Methods: Using data from the Korean nationwide cohort, this study included 37,629 patients with concurrent diabetes and chronic hepatitis B/C infection, without prior HCC, who were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents. Patients who were treated with SGLT2is for over 90 days were allocated to the SGLT2i group, whereas those who never received SGLT2is comprised the non-SGLT2i group. The primary outcome was the occurrence of liver-related events, including HCC. Results: After 1:2 propensity score matching, the SGLT2i group comprised 12,543 patients (chronic hepatitis B, CHB: n = 9392; chronic hepatitis C, CHC: n = 4300, CHB &amp; CHC: n = 1149), while the non-SGLT2i group included 25,086 patients (CHB: n = 18,806; CHC: n = 8553, CHB &amp; CHC: 2273). The incidence rate of composite liver-related complications was lower in the SGLT2i group than that in the non-SGLT2i group (6.67 per 1000 vs. 8.99 per 1000). Moreover, SGLT2i therapy was associated with a reduced risk of HCC development (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] = 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66-0.91; p = 0.002) and developing cirrhosis (sHR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.54-0.83; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: SGLT2is should be considered a therapeutic option for controlling diabetes, reducing the metabolic burden, and improving liver outcomes in patients with concurrent diabetes and chronic viral hepatitis.</description>

Mounting evidence suggests that microbial dysbiosis contributes to oncogenesis by driving chronic inflammation, producing genotoxic metabolites, altering bile acid metabolism, and disrupting epithelial barrier integrity. At the same time, the gut microbiome significantly modulates the host response to oncotherapies including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and especially immunotherapy, where microbial diversity and specific taxa determine treatment efficacy and toxicity. This review synthesizes current evidence on the role of the gut microbiome in both oncogenesis and oncotherapies, focusing on thirteen cancers with the strongest and most clinically relevant microbiome associations, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gallbladder cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, oral squamous cell carcinoma, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, and melanoma. These cancers were selected based on robust mechanistic data linking microbial alterations to tumor initiation, progression, and therapy modulation, as well as their global health burden and translational potential. In addition, we have provided mechanistic insights or clinical correlations between the microbiome and cancer outcomes. Across cancers, common microbial mechanisms included pro-inflammatory signaling (e.g., NF-κB and STAT3 pathways), DNA damage from bacterial toxins (e.g., colibactin, nitrosating species), and metabolite-driven tumor promotion (e.g., secondary bile acids, trimethylamine N-oxide). Conversely, beneficial commensals such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Akkermansia muciniphila supported antitumor immunity and improved responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. In conclusion, the gut microbiome functions as both a driver of malignancy and a modifiable determinant of therapeutic success. Integrating microbiome profiling and modulation strategies such as dietary interventions, probiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation into oncology practice may pave the way for personalized and more effective cancer care.</description>

The first description of 'cancerous phthisis' was reported by Bayle in 1810. The results of subsequent attempts to establish an etiological correlation between the two clinical entities have ranged from insignificant-even antagonistic-to a direct causal relationship. This narrative review explores the relationship between tuberculosis and LC assessing overall and site-specific malignancy risks in individuals with TB compared with the general population. We also examine the timing of cancer development following TB, highlighting periods of elevated risk. Chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic changes associated with TB may contribute to tumor initiation and progression, with organ-specific factors influencing susceptibility to cancers such as lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal, and hematologic malignancies. Clinically, awareness of these interactions supports targeted TB screening in high-risk cancer patients, careful monitoring for TB reactivation during cancer therapy, and consideration of immunological and metabolic factors when planning treatment.</description>

This study evaluated the potential of X-ray Dark-Field Imaging Computed Tomography (XDFI CT) using synchrotron radiation for non-destructive, three-dimensional visualization of human lung cancer microstructures. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung cancer specimens (n = 4) were examined, including acinar-predominant adenocarcinoma (n = 1), adenocarcinoma after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (n = 1), keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1), and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in the lung (n = 1). Image acquisition was performed at beamline BL-14B of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), using a monochromatic 19.8 keV synchrotron X-ray beam and a crystal analyzer-based refraction-contrast optical system. Imaging findings were qualitatively correlated with corresponding histopathological sections. RESULTS: Synchrotron radiation XDFI CT enabled clear visualization of normal distal lung microanatomy, including alveolar walls and associated vascular structures, which served as internal references adjacent to tumor regions. Distinct microstructural features-such as invasive growth patterns, fibrotic or keratinized stroma, necrosis, and treatment-related remodeling-were identifiable and varied according to histological subtype. Tumor-normal tissue transitional zones were consistently delineated in all specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Synchrotron radiation XDFI CT provides high-resolution, non-destructive volumetric imaging of lung cancer tissues and reveals subtype-associated microarchitectural features. This technique may complement conventional histopathology by enabling three-dimensional virtual histologic assessment of lung cancer specimens.</description>

Methods: We conducted a nationwide cohort study of Korean adults aged ≥75 years who underwent standardized health screening. Exposures were body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and MetS defined by standard clinical criteria. The incidence of thyroid cancer was determined using administrative data. Fine-Gray sub-distribution hazard models estimated adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with prespecified stratification by sex and age (75-84 vs. ≥85 years). Results: Among 1,164,707 participants (60.3% women), 2645 incident cases were identified. In the fully adjusted models, obesity (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2) was associated with a 37% higher hazard (HR, 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.49) and MetS with an 18% higher hazard (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28). In sex-stratified models, MetS was associated with thyroid cancer in women (HR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.08-1.31) and showed a similar direction of association in men (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.00-1.35), with overlapping CIs. By age, associations were evident at 75-84 years (MetS: HR, 1.18; obesity: HR, 1.36), whereas at ≥85 years, only obesity remained significant (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.13-3.18). Among MetS components, high WC showed the most consistent association (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.42). Conclusions: In adults aged ≥75 years, general obesity and, in particular, central adiposity are robustly associated with incident thyroid cancer, whereas metabolic syndrome confers a more modest and mainly age- and sex-specific additional risk.</description>

However, oral and maxillofacial surgeons have limited education and exposure to AI in the clinical and administrative setting. The purpose of this review is to provide an introduction of core concepts in commonly used AI models while providing relevant context in oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS). Challenges and potential solutions to development of AI in OMS are also discussed. FINDINGS: Preliminary studies using AI/ML in OMS have demonstrated high performance in metrics including sensitivity, specificity, Dice coefficient, intersection over union, and residual error. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Oral and maxillofacial surgeons should have a functional knowledge of AI technologies to guide development, testing, and adoption into OMS. With surgeon guidance, AI/ML has the potential for meaningful application across multiple clinical and administrative domains of OMS.</description>

Systemic chemotherapy plays a crucial role in the management of node-positive or metastatic cases; however, the supporting evidence predominantly originates from small, non-randomized studies. This review provides a narrative analysis of the cytotoxic classes and regimens employed in PSCC and compares major clinical guidelines to facilitate informed decision-making in practice. Methods: English-language reports were identified in PubMed/Scopus/Google Scholar without date limits. Selection prioritized objective response, survival and toxicity outcomes, and guidance statements across neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative settings. Results: Bleomycin-containing triplet regimens demonstrated efficacy but were associated with unacceptable pulmonary toxicity, leading to their discontinuation in clinical recommendations. Currently, cisplatin/taxane-based combinations remain fundamental in treatment protocols. The paclitaxel-ifosfamide-cisplatin (TIP) regimen achieves approximately 40-50% objective responses in phase II studies and may enable curative surgery, while taxane-cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (TPF) shows comparable efficacy with higher toxicity. For less fit patients, cisplatin-5-fluorouracil (PF) or carboplatin-taxane doublets are pragmatic alternatives. Single-agent taxanes or vinflunine offer modest second-line benefits. Although EAU-ASCO 2023, ESMO-EURACAN 2024, and NCCN v2.2025 are broadly in consensus, recommendations differ regarding eligibility thresholds and regimen preferences. Overall, the quality of the evidence remains low. Conclusions: TIP remains the reference neoadjuvant option for chemotherapy-fit patients with bulky nodal disease; doublets are reasonable when cisplatin fitness is limited; and bleomycin should be avoided. Harmonized eligibility criteria, biomarker-enriched studies, and coordinated multicenter trials are needed to improve outcomes in this rare malignancy.</description>

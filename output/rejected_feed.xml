      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Silvani C, Tylecki A, Santangelo A, Stephens A, Considine J, Gishto R, Perry M, Nazzani S, Briganti A, Salonia A, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70241'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41457426/'&gt;41457426&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Penile cancer is a rare malignancy influenced by socioeconomic factors. The Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantage, and its association with penile cancer stage at presentation has not been studied. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the ADI and advanced-stage disease at diagnosis in penile cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services database of patients aged ≥18 years with penile squamous cell carcinoma from 2004 to 2019. Advanced-stage disease was defined as pathological T stage ≥2, pathological evidence of nodal metastasis, or reported presence of distal metastasis. ADI scores were compared to the national median value. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the ADI and advanced disease after adjusting for relevant covariates. RESULTS: Among 353 patients (median age, 72 years; 84.4% White), the median ADI score was 69. Patients were stratified into two groups on the basis of the national median; 76% were in the high-ADI group. Black patients were more prevalent in the higher ADI group (15.3% vs. 2.4%; p = .003). Advanced-stage penile cancer was more frequent in the higher ADI group (49.3% vs. 36.5%; p = .04). In multivariable analysis, each 10-point increase in the ADI was associated with 1.16-fold increased odds of advanced-stage disease (95% CI, 1.04-1.29; p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Greater neighborhood-level socioeconomic deprivation is associated with advanced-stage disease at penile cancer diagnosis. These findings emphasize the role of social determinants in disease presentation, and may guide targeted interventions in disadvantaged populations.</description>

We report the long-term follow-up of the study focusing on the individuals with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutated (IDHmt) tumours. METHODS: This randomised, open-label, phase 3 study in 137 institutions across Australia, Europe, and North America included participants aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed 1p/19q non-co-deleted anaplastic gliomas and a WHO performance status of 0-2. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1) centrally using a minimisation technique to radiotherapy alone (59·4 Gy in 33 fractions), radiotherapy with concurrent oral temozolomide (75 mg/m2 per day), radiotherapy with adjuvant oral temozolomide (12 4-week cycles of 150-200 mg/m2 temozolomide given on days 1-5), or radiotherapy with both concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide. Participants were stratified by institution, WHO performance status score, age, 1p loss of heterozygosity, the presence of oligodendroglial elements on microscopy, and MGMT promoter methylation status. The primary endpoint was overall survival adjusted by stratification factors at randomisation in the intention-to-treat population. The eighth amendment of the study protocol (June 27, 2011) incorporated analysis of IDH mutational status into the study. We report the intention-to-treat analysis and the exploratory analysis within the population of participants with astrocytoma with an IDH mutation. As the safety data have been published previously, no safety data are reported. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00626990, and is completed. FINDINGS: Between Dec 4, 2007, and Sept 11, 2015, 1407 participants were registered and 751 participants were randomly allocated, 444 of whom were diagnosed with an IDHmt tumour. After a median follow-up for overall survival of 10·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·7), in the intention-to-treat population, adjuvant temozolomide improved overall survival compared with no adjuvant temozolomide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·65 [95% CI 0·54-0·77]), but concurrent did not compared with no concurrent temozolomide (HR 0·91 [0·76-1·08]). In univariable analysis of the participants with an IDHmt tumour, concurrent temozolomide had no statistically significant effect on overall survival (median 9·7 years [8·2-12·5] vs 7·2 years [6·2-9·4]; HR 0·81 [0·63-1·04]), but median overall survival was 12·5 years (95% CI 9·4-15·0) with adjuvant temozolomide compared with 6·0 years (5·1-7·2) with no adjuvant temozolomide (HR 0·54 [0·42-0·69]). No benefit of temozolomide, neither concurrent nor adjuvant, was observed in participants with IDH wild-type tumours. Methylation-based subtyping and several DNA alterations (eg, amplification of PDGFRA and CDK4, homozygous deletion of CDKN2A, and total copy number variation) were associated with worse outcome, none of which was predictive for benefit to temozolomide. INTERPRETATION: Long-term follow-up confirms that radiotherapy followed by 12 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide without concurrent temozolomide during radiotherapy improves survival for individuals with aggressive IDHmt astrocytoma.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hsu CH, Lu Z, Gao S, Wang J, Sun JM, Liu T, Fan Q, Cai J, Ge F, Li S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Lancet. Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00401-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449142/'&gt;41449142&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is an unmet need for additional and more efficacious therapies for patients with unresectable metastatic oesophageal cancer. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding tiragolumab and atezolizumab to chemotherapy as first-line treatment for unresectable or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: The SKYSCRAPER-08 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial was done at 67 centres in mainland China, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, and Hong Kong and enrolled adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with treatment-naive, unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive tiragolumab (600 mg) plus atezolizumab (1200 mg) and chemotherapy (paclitaxel [175 mg/m2] and cisplatin [60-80 mg/m2]) or placebo and chemotherapy through intravenous infusion for six 21-day cycles. The primary outcomes were independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all randomly assigned patients, regardless of whether they received any study treatment). This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04540211, and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 30, 2020, and Nov 30, 2021, 461 patients were assigned to receive tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy (n=229) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=232); 406 (88%) were male and 55 (12%) female, and all patients were Asian. Median survival follow-up was 12·6 months (IQR 6·8-18·0). Median independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival (cutoff June 15, 2022) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group was 6·2 months (95% CI 5·7-7·2) versus 5·4 months (95% CI 4·4-5·5) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (HR 0·56, 95% CI 0·45-0·70; p&lt;0·0001). Median overall survival (cutoff Feb 13, 2023) was 15·7 months (95% CI 13·3-20·4) and 11·1 months (95% CI 9·6-13·6; HR 0·70, 95% CI 0·55-0·88; p=0·0024). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group versus the placebo and chemotherapy group were white blood cell count decrease (46 [20%] of 228 vs 35 [15%] of 227), neutrophil count decrease (78 [34%] vs 78 [34%]), and anaemia (19 [8%] vs 24 [11%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 94 (41%) of 228 patients in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group and 89 (39%) of 227 in the placebo and chemotherapy group; the most common serious adverse event was pneumonia (17 [7%] of 228 and 13 [6%] of 227). Treatment-related deaths occurred in six patients (3%) in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group (immune-mediated lung disease, pneumonitis, cardiac arrest, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hepatic failure, and bacterial pneumonia) and two (1%) in the placebo and chemotherapy group (gastrointestinal infection and death of unknown cause). No new safety signals were identified. INTERPRETATION: Independent review facility-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival were significantly better in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and chemotherapy group compared with chemotherapy alone for unresectable locally advanced, unresectable recurrent, or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. These data support the rationale for exploring dual checkpoint inhibition added to chemotherapy for this group of patients with a high unmet need.

While previous studies have reported disruption of bee gut microbial communities following pesticide exposure, the effects of short-term sublethal exposure in stingless bees remain unclear. This study evaluated the impact of sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid (LC50/100 and LC50/1000) on the midgut microbiota composition of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris. Using metabarcoding of the V3 and V4 regions of 16S rRNA to characterize bacterial community composition and diversity, we analysed midgut bacterial communities of bees collected directly from hives (T0 group) and after 24 and 48 hours of oral imidacloprid exposure. Our results showed that, after 24 and 48 hours of exposure, there were no significant changes in midgut bacterial diversity or composition between bees exposed to sublethal concentrations of imidacloprid and their respective controls. In contrast, we observed clear differences in both diversity and abundance between the T0 group and control groups, especially after 24 hours of incubation. These differences were primarily associated with shifts in Acetobacteraceae family, likely reflecting the influence of the artificial sucrose diet provided under laboratory conditions. It is important to note that our findings pertain only to acute effects. Future studies would benefit from extending the duration of exposure and including a broader range of toxicological endpoints to build on these findings. Our results also underscore the importance of evaluating both exposure period and dietary conditions when investigating pesticide impacts on bee microbiota.</description>

Preclinical studies suggest that this may result from inflammation-induced destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate changes in vessel wall inflammation assessed using [18F]FDG positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) after ICI initiation. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study of patients with Merkel cell carcinoma who received at least one cycle of the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor avelumab and underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT before initiation of treatment and after 3 months. The primary outcome was the change in the target-to-background ratio (TBRmax) in the descending aorta between baseline and first follow-up scan. Secondary outcomes included the change in TBRmax in the carotid arteries, spleen, and bone marrow, and incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were included (66% male; median age 75 years). Most patients had established risk factors for cardiovascular disease (62%). The [18F]FDG TBRmax in the descending aorta increased from 1.52 (IQR, 1.39-1.70) at baseline to 1.64 (IQR, 1.41-1.97) after 3 months of treatment (change 7.8%. p = 0.022). No significant changes were observed in the carotid arteries, bone marrow, and spleen. Statin use was not associated with an attenuated change in TBRmax. During a median follow-up of 2.3 (IQR, 1.5-4.2) years, one nonfatal ischemic stroke occurred. CONCLUSION: Avelumab treatment was associated with an increase in [18F]FDG uptake in the descending aorta after 3 months of treatment, which may be a potential marker of inflammation-driven accelerated atherosclerosis in patients receiving ICIs.</description>

The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of erdafitinib using a pooled analysis of patients with CCA from the RAGNAR and LUC2001 studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In RAGNAR (phase 2, global, tumor-agnostic study) and LUC2001 (an open-label, multicenter, phase 2a study in Asian patients), patients with advanced solid tumors after ≥1 prior lines of therapy received once-daily oral erdafitinib (8 mg/day with an option for pharmacodynamically guided up-titration to 9 mg). Patients were pooled for efficacy (objective response rate [ORR] per a blinded independent review committee, duration of response [DOR], progression-free survival [PFS], overall survival [OS]) and safety analyses. RESULTS: At a median efficacy follow-up of 14.7 months in 78 erdafitinib-treated patients (RAGNAR: n=66; LUC2001: n=12), ORR was 55% (95% CI: 43.4-66.4). Median time to response was 1.7 months; median DOR, PFS, and OS were 6.9 (95% CI: 4.37-8.61), 8.5 (95% CI: 6.83 -9.72), and 18.1 (95% CI: 13.40-24.28) months, respectively. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83%), stomatitis (72%), diarrhea (68%), dry mouth (51%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (51%); 42% had serious TEAEs, and 12% had TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled analyses confirm the robust efficacy of erdafitinib in a diverse population of pretreated patients with advanced/metastatic CCA harboring prespecified FGFR alterations. These findings are consistent with previously observed efficacy of FGFR-targeted agents in patients with CCA.</description>

We previously reported a randomized trial targeting women who had not attended screening after &gt;10 invitations, where sending of self-sampling kits resulted in a 19% attendance and a positive predictive value (PPV) for high grade lesions (HSIL+) of 40%, despite no triaging after the HPV test. Because of the striking results, the intervention was extended to all women resident in Stockholm County, Sweden, in the years 2019/20, who had not attended screening &gt;10 years (N = 42,409). Participation was 35.6% and 11.6% of the participating women were HPV-positive. Among these, there were 43 cases of invasive cervical cancer and 319 cases of high-grade lesions. The PPV was particularly high for HPV16/18 positive women (12% for invasive cancer and 59% for HSIL). In summary, participation with HPV self-sampling among long-term non-attenders in the real-life program was considerably higher than in the research setting and the high yield of HSIL+ implied high effectiveness.</description>

This multicenter study evaluates age-specific performance of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as cross-sectional and longitudinal screening for cervical cancer among 28,501 Chinese women. At baseline, HPV screening with cytology triage demonstrates higher sensitivity (96.9% vs. 79.7%) but slightly lower specificity (88.8% vs. 92.7%) than cytology with HPV triage for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). HPV sensitivities remain high across age groups (≤35: 100.0%; 36-45: 96.4%; &gt;45: 96.8%), consistently exceeding the corresponding cytology sensitivities (66.7%, 75.7%, and 84.9%). Over a three-year follow-up, HPV screening maintains superior sensitivity (93.1% vs. 58.1%) and slightly lower specificity (89.6% vs. 92.4%) compared with cytology. Age-stratified analyses in the longitudinal setting reveal trends similar to those observed in the cross-sectional analyses. Women positive for HPV16/18 have a 43.0% three-year risk of CIN2+, compared with 0.2% for HPV-negative women. These findings support the durable protection of HPV-based screening and the feasibility of extending screening intervals.</description>

METHODS: Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data (2007-August 2023) among individuals aged 9-26 years, we assessed trends in HPV vaccination prevalence (≥ 1 dose) with joinpoint regression to identify inflection points and estimate annual percent changes (APCs). Analyses were stratified by sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Vaccination prevalence increased from 14.1% (95% CI, 10.1-19.3) in 2007-2008 to 49.1% (95% CI, 44.5-53.7) in 2021-2023 (APC, 6.8%; p = 0.001). Females experienced an early sharp rise (APC, 24.0%; p &lt; 0.001) through 2011-2012, followed by slower growth thereafter (APC, 3.7%; p = 0.004). Male vaccination increased steadily (APC, 11.3%; p &lt; 0.001). By 2021-2023, prevalence was highest among 13-17-year-olds (58.2%) and lowest among 9-12-year-olds (26.2%). Black individuals had the lowest vaccination prevalence of any racial/ethnic group (29.3%) and experienced a reversal of prior gains after 2015-2016 (APC, - 2.3%; p = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination prevalence more than tripled between 2007 and 2023, but the pace of growth slowed among females and reversed among Black individuals, which may exacerbate existing disparities in HPV-related cancer burden.</description>

Lipofuscin is a permanent intracellular deposit that accumulates with aging or oxidative stress. Its increase in skeletal muscles may lead to limitations in muscle function, such as weakness and fatigue. We aim to investigate whether lipofuscin deposits in the upper airway muscles of patients with severe OSA are increased compared to those in patients with primary snoring or very mild OSA. METHODS: We studied pharyngeal framework muscle tissue samples from non-obese adults, with one group having severe OSA and another having primary snoring or very mild OSA (snorer group). Lipofuscin was identified by analyzing staining patterns from Sudan Black B and fluorescence microscopy. We compared lipofuscin levels and distribution in the muscle fibers between the groups. RESULTS: Despite presenting similar age and body mass index, patients with severe OSA exhibited markedly larger and more concentrated deposits of lipofuscin in the upper airway muscles, particularly along the borders of the muscle fascicles, compared to the snorer group. CONCLUSION: Compared to primary snorers, patients with severe OSA accumulate lipofuscin in their pharyngeal muscles. Our findings may provide novel insight into the role of lipofuscin as both a marker and a cause of the aggravation of OSA, in light of a possible lipofuscin-induced progressive myopathy.</description>

METHODS: This study (NCT03072160) was designed to evaluate two cohorts of patients with medullary thyroid cancer, a cancer that is not known to have therapeutic responses to immune checkpoint inhibitors. One cohort included patients with previous immunotherapy (GI-6207, an experimental therapeutic cancer targeting carcinoembryonic antigen), and a second cohort included patients with no previous history of GI-6207. All patients were treated with standard of care dosing of pembrolizumab, 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. Patients were followed with imaging every 3 months. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were evaluated at 3 months for immune responses. RESULTS: 17 patients were enrolled on this study. Among the 13 patients with previous immunotherapy (GI-6207), the median age was 52.4 years. Among the 4 patients with no previous immunotherapy the median age was 58.8 years. No patients in either cohort had evidence of therapeutic response. No patients had confirmed 50% declines in either serum carcinoembryonic antigen or calcitonin. No radiographic responses were observed. There was no evidence of immune impact of pembrolizumab in analysis of PBMCs. Given the lack of responses in the previous immunotherapy cohort, the study was closed early. No new safety signals were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not support the hypothesis that sequencing immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor could enhance the clinical activity of the immune checkpoint, which has not demonstrated independent activity in that disease previously.</description>

Our aim was to access the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor tislelizumab combined with chemotherapy for locally advanced PSCC. METHODS: In this prospective, single-arm clinical study, eligible patients received Nab-Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 D1), Cisplatin (70 mg/m2 in 3 days), Bleomycin (30 mg D1, 8), and tislelizumab (200 mg D1) every 3 weeks for 4-6 cycles, followed by consolidative treatment if necessary. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Of all 20 enrolled patients, 75.0% (15/20) had a history of previous penectomy and were recurrence cases. The median treatment cycles was 4 (range: 2-6). The ORR reached 75.0%. 35.0% (7/20) of patients underwent consolidative surgery, and 55.0% (11/20) received maintenance immunotherapy (median 7 cycles). At median follow-up of 29.3 months, the median PFS and the median overall survival (OS) were 12.5 months (95% CI 7.4-NE), 22.8 months (95% CI 13.7-NE), respectively. Grade≥3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were observed in 40% (8/20) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tislelizumab with chemotherapy demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in locally advanced PSCC, with a manageable safety profile.</description>

However, robust quantitative data on their absorption, distribution, and excretion in mammals remain scarce. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of polystyrene (PS) NP biodistribution and elimination in rats using 14C-radiolabeling, the most accurate and quantitative method available. Pregnant rats were exposed to 14C-labeled 20 nm or 100 nm PS NPs (PS20 or PS100) via oral gavage, intratracheal aerosolization, or intravenous injection, and tissue distribution and excretion were determined by radioactivity measurements. We found that PS NPs were exclusively excreted through faeces, irrespective of the exposure routes, without urinary elimination. Both PS20 and PS100 crossed multiple biological barriers, yet only PS20 reached the brain. Maternal transfer of PS20 occurred through both placenta and milk, while PS100 transferred solely via milk. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model further simulated accumulation kinetics across tissues. This study establishes the most comprehensive and reliable quantitative profile of PS NP biodistribution in mammals to date, revealing distinct size-dependent translocation patterns that provide a robust foundation for evaluating their health impacts.</description>

While fecal-oral transmission is the primary route of infection, emerging evidence indicates that saliva may also function as a reservoir for these viruses, posing a potential risk for oral transmission. Previous studies have primarily focused on the decay of viruses in aqueous matrices, like wastewater and freshwater, but the persistence of these viruses in human saliva remains underexplored. This study aimed to investigate the persistence of AdV41 and CVB3 in both human and artificial saliva under various conditions, including the presence of fecal particles and specific oral bacteria. Our findings demonstrated that human saliva significantly reduced viral stability compared to artificial saliva, with marked reductions in viral titers observed within 24-48 hours. Particularly, the presence of fecal particles in both saliva types extended CVB3 viral persistence, suggesting a protective effect due to particle adsorption. However, AdV41 demonstrated an opposite trend when in the presence of fecal particles, suggesting virus-specific differences in how particulate matter influences stability. Additionally, specific oral bacteria, such as Streptococcus mutans, significantly enhanced CVB3 stability, with a mean viral recovery of 23.2% of the viral titer after 24 hours in the presence of the bacteria compared to 0.7% in their absence (p = 0.001). This study shows complex interactions between viruses, oral bacteria, and fecal particles within the oral environment, emphasizing the need for further research on oral viral persistence and transmission dynamics. Understanding these mechanisms behind viral persistence in saliva can inform public health strategies aimed at mitigating the risk of transmission.</description>

While sclerotherapy is an established treatment for HHT-related epistaxis, it is rarely used for oral telangiectasias. We retrospectively reviewed HHT patients who underwent oral sclerotherapy between 2021 and 2024 at a tertiary academic center. Eleven patients (64% female, mean age 61.3 years, 82% ACVRL1 genotype) underwent sclerotherapy using a 1:4 mixture of 3% sodium tetradecyl sulfate and air. Lesions treated included the lip (36%), tongue (36%), hard palate (18%), and gingiva (9%). Presenting symptoms included oral bleeding with eating and dietary limitations. Adverse effects included transient lip swelling (n = 2) and tongue burning (n = 1). At an average follow-up of 6 months, 10/11 patients with follow-up data had complete symptomatic and clinical resolution. Our findings suggest that oral sclerotherapy is a safe, effective, and minimally invasive treatment for HHT-related oral bleeding that clinicians should consider.</description>

However, delays in processing can prolong operative times. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a checklist to expedite ioPTH assay processes. METHODS: A multidisciplinary checklist was developed to standardize ioPTH collection and workflow. Thirty patients treated with use of the checklist were prospectively studied, while 30 patients treated without use of the checklist were retrospectively reviewed. Time intervals for post-15-minute ioPTH assay results were compared. RESULTS: Thirty age- and sex-matched patients were included in each group (n = 60) involving 5 surgeons. The intervention and control group had a mean baseline PTH of 140.9 and 130.3 pg/mL and a post-15-minute ioPTH of 69.6 and 52.0 pg/mL, respectively. The mean time from sample collection to the post-15-minute ioPTH assay result was significantly reduced in the intervention as compared to the control group (22.2 vs 33.3 minutes; P &lt; .01). The proportional operative time spent awaiting ioPTH assay results was also reduced (24.4 vs 34.1%; P &lt; .01). In subgroup analysis, a significant difference in the total operative time was found in adenomatous disease (68.0 vs 92.2 minutes, P &lt; .05) but not four-gland hyperplasia (119.3 vs 142.3 minutes). DISCUSSION: The implementation of a simple intraoperative checklist effectively reduces the overall ioPTH assay processing time, creating a more efficient surgical workflow. It is low-cost and requires minimal additional resources. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This quality improvement intervention holds promise for broader adoption in parathyroid surgery to reduce delays and optimize patient care.</description>

This study aims to describe intraoperative methods for identifying the level of AC and to determine a safe inferior limit of thyroid cartilage excision during chondrolaryngoplasty. METHODS: Anterior thyroid cartilage length and anatomical AC position was measured in 105 transgender women who underwent feminization laryngoplasty [FemLar] between April 2022 and March 2025. In this retrospective review, 35/105 patients had a prior chondrolaryngoplasty performed elsewhere. The remaining 70 underwent FemLar for combined voice feminization and neck profile improvement. RESULTS: The AC was attached internally most commonly at 8 mm from the inferior thyroid border in (36%, 38/105), followed by 10 mm (25%, 26/105) and 9 mm (22%, 23/105). Among 70 patients without prior surgery, the AC was at the midpoint in 30%, 1 and 2 mm below midpoint in 43% and 19% respectively and 1 mm and 2 mm above the midpoint in 3% and 4% respectively. Vocal fold detachment was verified in 29% of patients with prior chondrolaryngoplasty where the cartilage had been removed to or inferior to the level of AC. CONCLUSION: The location of AC varies within a range of 2 mm above and below the midpoint or 6-10 mm from the inferior thyroid cartilage border. If not localizing the AC with endoscopy, a 2-3 mm safety margin above the estimated AC level should be considered during chondrolaryngoplasty.</description>

A majority of men who have sex with men (MSM) were using oral tablets; meanwhile alternative long-acting modalities have been and are being developed. We aimed to assess the prevalence of PrEP use and the preferences of potential long-acting PrEP in the MSM community in Hong Kong, an Asian Pacific city where free or subsidised PrEP is not available. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online self-administered questionnaire. Eligible participants were adult MSM without HIV infection who normally resided in Hong Kong. Historical and current PrEP use, and preferences of using long-acting injectable for PrEP were tested against sociodemographic and sexual behavioural factors using chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 437 responses collected, 17% had ever used PrEP and 16% were currently using PrEP. Current PrEP users were more likely to have a higher income level (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.11, p = 0.04), have engaged in chemsex (aOR 4.02, p &lt; 0.01), have a non-regular male sex partner (aOR 2.66, p = 0.02), have a male sex partner living with HIV (aOR 3.60, p &lt; 0.01), and be inclined to have condomless sex in the future (aOR 6.86, p &lt; 0.01). Among ever users, MSM who discontinued PrEP had a lower sexual risk than current users, such as recent history of chemsex (OR 0.22, p &lt; 0.01) and inclination to have condomless sex (OR 0.15, p &lt; 0.01). Long-acting injectables were accepted by 27% MSM, who were more likely to be current PrEP users (odds ratio [OR] 2.35, p &lt; 0.01), concerned about efficacy (OR 1.66, p = 0.03), and expecting to use PrEP for more than 2 years in the future (OR 9.69, p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of PrEP among MSM indicated an increased awareness over the past decade. However, its promotion could have been hindered by the absence of a publicly funded or subsidised programme. While PrEP users had a higher sexual risk, the utilisation pattern would be affected by the dynamicity of sexual activities. Long-acting injectables had a moderate acceptance rate. Current PrEP users and those anticipated long-term users could be prioritised for its promotion.</description>

This study investigated the utility of Long-Term Average Spectrum (LTAS) analysis in evaluating spectral changes after EVFS, identifying spectral markers to better capture surgical and therapeutic effects on voice feminization. METHODS: Voice recordings were collected, and LTAS was analyzed at baseline and at 3 and 12 months postoperatively. Spectral slope, Formant Cluster Prominence FCP [dB], and FCP (Hz) were examined across timepoints. At 12-months, transgender participants were compared to cisgender male and female control voices for reference. RESULTS: At 3 months, spectral energy increased in the higher frequency range, spectral slope flattened, and FCP [dB] was significantly reduced. By 12 months, spectral slope remained flatter than baseline, and FCP [dB] demonstrated a modest rebound, but remained below preoperative levels. Group comparisons demonstrated clear approximation of transgender women toward cisgender female spectral profiles at 12 months, with divergence from cisgender male patterns. LTAS parameters-including spectral slope and FCP [dB]-showed marked convergence with cisgender female characteristics. Importantly, sound pressure level (SPL) remained stable, suggesting spectral changes primarily reflected structural and behavioral adaptation rather than intensity. CONCLUSIONS: LTAS provides valuable insight into the spectral dynamics of voice feminization after EVFS beyond fo. Observed spectral changes over time suggest behavioral adaptation to surgical modification may extend for up to a year. Thus, LTAS emerges as a useful tool for monitoring recovery and adaptation.</description>

Herein, we engineer a biohybrid delivery system through the integration of milk extracellular vesicles with liposomes. The hybrid vesicles employ targeting mechanisms via neonatal Fc receptor and peptide transporter 1, facilitating antibiotic transport across the proximal small intestine. These vesicles exhibit superior drug encapsulation efficiency, stable release behavior, efficient mucus traversal, higher endocytosis, increased basolateral exocytosis, and improved oral absorption, achieving a 3.24-fold increase in oral bioavailability compared to free antibiotics. In lung bacterial infections and bacteremia models, hybrid vesicle-encapsulated cefdinir outperforms free antibiotics in eliminating infections. Notably, this approach also mitigates adverse effects on the intestinal microbiota, safeguarding the animals from dysbiosis-associated metabolic syndromes and opportunistic pathogen infections. This innovative hybrid vesicle system holds promise for the oral delivery of other drugs that suffer from limited absorption or cause gut dysbiosis.</description>

METHODS: The synthesized age-period-cohort prediction method is used for projection. RESULTS: Among men, mortality from oral, prostate, and kidney cancers would increase by 2050. Esophageal and brain cancers follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from most other cancers would decline. Lung (18.54 % of all cancer deaths), prostate (17.25 %), oral (15.10 %), colorectal (11.11 %), and liver (9.07 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in men by 2050, accounting for 71.08 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from bladder and kidney cancers would slightly increase. Among women, mortality from ovarian cancer would increase steadily. Pancreatic, breast, cervical, endometrial, bladder, and brain cancers would follow a U-shaped trend. Mortality from other cancers would decline. Lung (13.63 %), breast (13.06 %), bladder (12.90 %), colorectal (12.81 %), and pancreatic (11.24 %) cancers would become leading causes of cancer death in women by 2050, accounting for 63.65 % of all cancer deaths. Mortality from ovarian cancer would increase from 3.57 % to 5.42 % (from 2023 to 2050). CONCLUSIONS: Kidney, prostate, pancreatic, endometrial, ovarian, and bladder cancers are projected to surpass their observation in past and may become new threat in future.</description>

In Nigeria, challenges such as poverty, stigma, and poor access to healthcare continue to heighten their vulnerability, even though prevention programmes are in place. However, limited qualitative evidence exists on how FSWs perceive sexual risks, the motivations driving unsafe practices, and the strategies used to mitigate them. This study draws from the constructs of the Health Belief Model (HBM) to examine the experiences of brothel-based FSWs on vaginal, oral, and Anogenital sexual activity. METHODS: This qualitative study was conducted in brothels located in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria, as part of the SHINI Project. Two focus group. discussions (FGDs) with 19 participants and five in-depth interviews (IDIs) were held with purposively selected FSWs aged 18–45 years. Data were collected between August and October 2016, audio-recorded, transcribed, translated into English, and coded using NVivo 11. Thematic analysis was applied to identify patterns related to perceived risks, motivations, and coping strategies. RESULTS: FSWs perceived oral and Anogenital sexual activity as high-risk practices, linking them to infections such as syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as long-term complications including mouth cancer, faecal incontinence, and rectal trauma. Motivations for engaging in unsafe sexual behaviours included financial incentives, fear of losing clients, peer influence, and curiosity. While some participants demonstrated agency by refusing unsafe sex or negotiating safer alternatives, economic hardship, client coercion, and stigma often limited their ability to act. Coping strategies included outright refusal, condom use, negotiation for alternative styles, and frequent medical check-ups, though stigma and discriminatory health services reduced care-seeking. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the complex balance between economic survival and health risk awareness among brothel-based FSWs. To reduce these risks, this study recommends the implementation of targeted interventions targeted interventions are needed, including comprehensive sexual health education, stigma-free healthcare services, improved access to condoms and lubricants, and economic empowerment initiatives. Collaboration between government agencies, NGOs, healthcare providers, and community organisations is essential to reduce vulnerabilities and improve the health outcomes of this key population.

However, in South America, its adoption has been uneven, reflecting structural, political, and socio-cultural inequalities. This study maps and analyzes national PrEP policies across 13 South American countries through an intersectional lens, identifying challenges and opportunities for more equitable HIV prevention strategies. METHODS: We conducted a documentary survey of national PrEP-related policies, clinical guidelines, regulations, and public communications from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela. Searches were performed on institutional websites in Portuguese, Spanish, English, and French using predefined keywords. In the absence of official policy documents, information was collected from media and civil society sources. Data from 118 documents were coded and analyzed using iterative summative content analysis, integrating intersectionality theory to assess how policies address (or neglect) structural inequalities. RESULTS: Ten countries have formal national PrEP policies (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, French Guiana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay), with Brazil pioneering implementation in 2017. Three countries (Bolivia, Suriname, Venezuela) lack comprehensive national guidelines. Most countries recommend daily oral PrEP; on-demand dosing is approved in fewer contexts, often with restrictions. Long-acting injectable cabotegravir has been approved only in Brazil, French Guiana, and Peru, but remains largely unavailable. Geographic coverage ranges from national to highly localized models. Prioritized groups include men who have sex with men, transgender women, sex workers, serodifferent couples, and, in some countries, people who use drugs. Policy formulation involves ministries of health, academia, international organizations, and, variably, civil society. However, inclusion of marginalized populations and integration of intersectional approaches remain limited. There are inequalities in the incorporation of social markers of difference in PrEP policies across the region, with greater emphasis on sexuality, gender, class, and health conditions, and limited attention to race/ethnicity, territory, generation, and disability. CONCLUSION: PrEP policy adoption in South America demonstrates significant heterogeneity, shaped by intersecting social, political, and institutional factors. While the region has made notable advances, access remains uneven, with structural barriers such as stigma, regulatory gaps, and geographic inequities limiting impact. Incorporating intersectional perspectives into policy design and implementation is essential to ensure that PrEP - in all its modalities - is accessible as a right to health, addressing differences across multiple social, geographic, and economic dimensions.</description>

Although discrimination is posited to contribute to hypertension disparities, researchers have largely focused on the role of experienced discrimination with limited examination of other types of discrimination, such as anticipated and vicarious discrimination. Existing research ignores intersectional discrimination, which obscures the experiences of those that face discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities. This study addresses limitations of prior work by examining the influence of intersectional anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure in adults within their real-world contexts. METHODS: This 7-day intensive longitudinal study uses an intersectional approach to examine the influence of daily and chronic forms of anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure and mediators of these associations. The proposed sample includes 400 adults (ages 18-64) living in New York City that are diverse in terms of ethnoracial, sexual, and gender identities. The study includes two in-person visits and a 7-day home assessment. Participants will complete a baseline structured interview, daily structured morning diaries, daily structured evening diaries, self-collection of saliva samples to assess salivary stress biomarkers, continuous wrist-worn actigraphy, and home blood pressure monitoring. We will test physiological (e.g., salivary cortisol), behavioral (e.g., sleep duration and physical activity), and affective (e.g., depressive and anxiety symptoms) factors to determine whether they mediate the influence of anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure. We will use multilevel linear models to estimate within- and between-person effects of daily and chronic anticipated and vicarious discrimination on blood pressure. DISCUSSION: My Heart, My Self addresses significant limitations in prior research on the link between discrimination and cardiovascular health. Our findings may shed light on effects of indirect forms of discrimination on blood pressure. This work will inform behavioral interventions that target anticipated and vicarious discrimination as risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</description>

We developed curatedMetagenomicData (cMD) 3, a uniformly processed collection of over 22,000 human microbiome samples with manually curated metadata from 94 studies and 42 countries. This large and diverse resource allows for meta-analysis of the links between microbes and human health. Through meta-analysis, we identified hundreds of microbial species and thousands of microbial functions significantly associated with a person's sex, age, body mass index, and disease status, and catalog these as references. We developed an "oral enrichment score" (OES) based on the relative abundance of bacteria typically found in the oral cavity and not in the gut. Higher OES in the gut is a consistent feature in individuals with disease, suggesting that the relative abundance of oral bacteria in the gut is a simple and quantifiable signal of altered microbiome health. These analyses identify modest but widely shared patterns in human microbiomes, serving as a reproducible and readily updatable reference.</description>

Cigarette smoking prevalence exceeds 30% in much of the region. Oral nicotine pouches (ONPs), which contain nicotine but no tobacco, present an unexplored opportunity to reduce cigarette smoking and cancer incidence. OBJECTIVES: We outline the protocol for the Appalachian Research to Impact Smoking's Effects (ARISE) study, a randomized controlled trial to determine whether ONPs affect cigarette smoking patterns short- and long-term, and to evaluate their abuse liability versus nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in a large sample of Appalachian smokers (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT06763536). METHODS: Between 2025 and 2029, we will recruit 1,000 adult smokers living in rural Appalachian counties across 11 states. Participants will be identified via media outreach, mobile cancer screening, community events, and respondent-driven sampling, then randomized to ONP or NRT and complete four study phases: Baseline, Sampling, Switch, and Observation. In the Sampling phase, participants will receive varied flavors and nicotine strengths of their assigned product and select preferred options for use. During the Switch Phase, they will attempt to quit smoking and switch completely to their assigned product. The Observation phase will monitor tobacco use after discontinuation of study products. Study procedures will be conducted online and by mail, including surveys, expired carbon monoxide verification, and product delivery. The primary outcome is 7-day biochemically verified cigarette abstinence at the end of the Switch Phase. Secondary outcomes include switching rates, product appeal, craving, withdrawal, dependence, and purchases during the Observation phase. An intention-to-treat log-binomial regression model will estimate the effect of intervention assignment on cigarette abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Results will inform whether and how ONPs should be regulated, approached clinically, and used in public health interventions to reduce the burdens of cigarette smoking in Appalachia.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A split mouth RCT was designed with 216 MAGRD that were assigned to VISTA alone and VISTA with A-PRF. The complete root coverage (CRC) and gingival thickness (GT) were measured using CBCT at baseline and 12 months post-operatively, while the clinical parameters of probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized gingival (WKG), gingival recession depth (GRD), and gingival recession width (GRW) were recorded at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. RESULTS: From baseline to 12 months, there was a significant decrease in the mean values of GRD and GRW with an increase in WKG. CBCT scans showed a significant increase in GT mean values. According to these results, the Test group's CRC was higher (95.92%) than the Control groups (85.02%). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the Control group, the Test group demonstrated superior MAGRD resolution in achieving a decrease in GRD and GRW as well as a higher increase in WKG and GT. These findings resulted into a substantially more CRC for the Test group. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration no. CTRI/2022/09/045845. Registered on: 26/09/2022.</description>

This study explores how CCCs collect, interpret, and use assessment data to evaluate resident performance and progress. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study using focus groups with OHNS faculty who serve on CCCs at the November 2024 Society of University Otolaryngologists meeting. Discussions explored the types of assessment data gathered and how this information is interpreted and applied. Audio recordings were transcribed, de-identified, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-one CCC members participated in three seven-person focus groups. Thematic analysis revealed the following findings related to CCC decision-making: (1) There is substantial heterogeneity in the types of data collected and used; (2) Narrative and verbal feedback outweighed structured data; (3) Challenges emerged due to a need to transform informal feedback into documented, defensible data for high-stakes decisions. Gaps in the CCC process included: (1) Collection of data that is ultimately unused in decision-making; (2) A lack of structured mechanisms to encourage faculty engagement and development for performing assessments; and (3) A focus on identifying struggling residents rather than fostering development across all levels of trainee performance. CONCLUSIONS: OHNS CCCs rely on a heterogeneous mix of formal and informal data, with narrative feedback often the most influential in decision-making. The process is challenged by data overload, variable faculty engagement, and a lack of standardization. Addressing such challenges may improve the quality, equity, and transparency of resident assessment and progression decisions.</description>

Aspiration pneumonia is a leading cause of death in advanced AD. Superior laryngeal nerve(SLN) dysfunction is hypothesized to be responsible for poor laryngeal sensation and aspiration pneumonia. The purpose of this study was to compare SLN neurophysiology in an AD rat model to control animals. METHODS: SLN-evoked studies were performed via stimulation of the main trunk in 4-month-old adult apolipoprotein-E4 (ApoE4-KI) rats (n = 8) versus wild-type rats (n = 10). Recording electrodes were placed on the internal branch of the SLN (iSLN) and cricothyroid muscles. Stimulated swallow force measurements from hyoid elevation were compared between groups. Outcome measures included both sensory and motor evoked responses. Additionally, force and frequency of electrically and tactile stimulated swallow reflexes were analyzed. RESULTS: Sensory nerve action potential duration was significantly longer in APOE-KI rats than controls with a mean difference (95% CI) of 2.24 ms (1.08-3.41). Both compound motor action potential latency and total duration were significantly longer in the APOE4-KI rats than controls with a mean difference (95% CI) of 0.22 (0.115-0.33) and 2.18 (0.90-3.4) respectively. Tactile-stimulated swallow frequency was significantly lower in the AD cohort vs. controls with a mean difference of -5.4 swallows/10 s (-7.6, -3.2). CONCLUSIONS: SLN evoked responses were significantly longer with a decrease in swallow frequency in an AD rat model compared to age-matched controls. This work suggests differences in SLN signaling between the cohorts. This work may provide a mechanistic understanding of SLN dysfunction and a tractable model to test new treatments for swallow dysfunction. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: N/A.</description>

This study evaluated the association between PDE5 inhibitor use and overall survival (OS) in male-predominant solid organ malignancies. METHODS: Male-predominant solid tumors were identified using male-to-female incidence ratio ≥3:1 in SEER database: prostate, bladder, colon, esophageal, hypopharyngeal, laryngeal, tonsillar, and testicular cancers. Using the TriNetX Research Network, we compared male patients prescribed PDE5 inhibitors within 6 months of cancer diagnosis to those without PDE5 exposure. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed on demographic, clinical, and oncologic variables. OS was assessed in a combined pan-cancer cohort, stratified by overall stage, and subgroups of included cancers. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted for 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS from diagnosis. RESULTS: After PSM, 108,630 patients were included in each arm of the pan-cancer analysis. PDE5 inhibitor exposure was associated with significantly improved OS at 1, 3, and 5 years compared with controls (5-year OS 93.8% vs 86.6%; HR, 0.42 [95% CI, 0.41-0.44]). Stratified analyses demonstrated significantly improved OS across all four stages, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.40 to 0.57. Subgroup analyses by tumor site likewise showed statistically significant improvement in OS for every included cancer type, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.35 to 0.70. CONCLUSIONS: PDE5 inhibitor use was consistently associated with improved OS across all male-predominant cancers, including in stage-stratified analyses. These findings support further investigation into the potential role of PDE5 inhibitors in cancer outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile and treatment patterns of cancer patients in Rajasthan, focusing on differences in disease presentation, treatment modalities, and outcomes between urban and rural populations. METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, Jaipur, including 1,366 histopathologically confirmed cancer patients admitted between January 2021 and December 2023. Data on demographics, cancer type, stage, treatment, and outcomes were analyzed using SPSS version 28, comparing rural and urban groups. RESULTS: Of the 1,366 patients, 77.45% were from rural areas. Rural patients had higher rates of advanced-stage (Stage IV) presentation (56.1% vs. 47.7%, p = 0.047) and tobacco use (16.8% vs. 10.4%, p = 0.006). Head and neck cancers were most common in men (20.7%), and breast cancer in women (8.2%). Chemotherapy was the predominant treatment (84%) modality, while urban patients more frequently received multimodal therapy. In-hospital mortality was comparable between groups (4.82% vs. 4.22%, p = 0.661), as were readmission rates. CONCLUSION: Rural patients experienced a greater cancer burden due to delayed diagnosis and limited access to comprehensive care. Strengthening rural oncology services, improving early detection, and addressing modifiable risk factors like tobacco use are critical for reducing disparities and improving outcomes.</description>

This study aims to evaluate the differences in efficacy and survival outcomes between NAC and AC in PSCC patients with lymph node metastasis. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of penile cancer patients treated at Peking University Cancer Hospital between May 2015 and December 2023. All patients had lymph node metastasis and underwent lymph node dissection. 11 patients received NAC, while 14 received AC. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate Cox regression models were used to analyze baseline characteristics, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and associated risk factors. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference in the baseline characteristics of patients between the two groups. In the NAC group, 4 patients achieved partial response (PR), 1 achieved complete response (CR), 4 achieved progression disease (PD), and 2 had stable disease (SD). After a median follow-up of 65.1 months, the NAC group had a shorter PFS compared to the AC group (P = 0.029), while no significant difference was observed in OS (P = 0.268). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified the presence of cM stage as an independent predictor of both PFS and OS. CONCLUSION: Penile cancer with lymph node metastasis typically carries a dismal prognosis. NAC substantially diminishes tumor size and facilitates surgical excision, whereas AC is more effective in controlling postoperative tumor progression. However, there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two treatment strategies.</description>

The use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) and the adjunctive administration of pentoxifylline and tocopherol (PenTo) have shown promising preliminary results in the clinical management of MRONJ; however, robust data remain limited. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcomes of surgically treated patients with stage I and II MRONJ, incorporating PenTo as an adjuvant to platelet concentrate therapy. Furthermore, the study seeks to evaluate both clinical and radiographic outcome variables throughout the follow-up period. METHODS: A controlled pharmacological clinical trial was conducted, using a standard drug regimen as the comparator. Total 20 patients diagnosed with stage I or II MRONJ were allocated into 2 groups: one group received surgical treatment combined with PRF, while the other underwent the same protocol supplemented with an adjuvant therapeutic regimen based on PenTo. Participants were recruited from the Oral Medicine Department, School of Dentistry, Universidad Católica de Córdoba. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were observed in the mean duration of antiresorptive therapy, which was notably longer in patients with osteoporosis (P = .01). Zoledronic acid was the most frequently associated drug (P = .0019). The addition of PenTo to the treatment protocol was associated with improved clinical and radiographic outcomes, with statistically significant differences (P = .0138 and P = .0046, respectively). Furthermore, the diagnostic stage (I or II) showed a significant correlation with clinical improvement following treatment (P = .0294). The healing index at 15, 90, and 180 days was higher in the group receiving PenTo, with statistically significant differences at each time point (P = .0441; P = .0001; P = .0018, respectively). In oncological patients, the healing index was also higher at all follow-up stages, with clear statistical significance (P = .0294; P = .0004; P = .0042). CONCLUSIONS: This study contributes with patient-based evidence to support the interdisciplinary management of MRONJ. The combination of surgical treatment, PRF, and PenTo may serve to optimize and enhance clinical strategies for this condition.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Higashi EM, Neves ILI, Darrieux FCDC, Alves Dos Santos Paul M, Paiva GLA, Omori VT, Simões Neves R, Scanavacca MI, Hachul DT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology and oral radiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oooo.2025.10.021'&gt;10.1016/j.oooo.2025.10.021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Nov-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41444034/'&gt;41444034&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of a protocol in which direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are not discontinued prior to tooth extractions, compared with warfarin. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective blind study was conducted on anticoagulated patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing tooth extraction. Patients were divided into three groups according to the anticoagulant pharmacokinetics: 20 patients on rivaroxaban once daily; 18 on dabigatran or apixaban twice daily, and 20 on warfarin (control group). Extractions were scheduled during the lowest DOACs plasma concentration: 14 hours after the last rivaroxaban dose; 8 hours after the last dabigatran/apixaban dose; and with INR values between 2.0 and 3.0 in the warfarin group. Patients returned 24 hours after tooth extraction for evaluation of bleeding. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patients were included in the study, in a total of 84 tooth extractions. No minor or major bleeding occurred in the rivaroxaban group. Two patients in the dabigatran/apixaban group (11.1%) and two in the control group (10%) presented minor bleeding. There was no statistically significant difference in bleeding rates among the groups (P = .324), and no major bleeding events were reported. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that the protocol proposing non-discontinuing DOACs in extractions may be feasible in clinical practice.</description>

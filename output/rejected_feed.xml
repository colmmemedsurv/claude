      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Hollander EM, Buma AIG, Leentjens J, Janssen PKC, van den Heuvel MM, Burger DM, Piet B, Ter Heine R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70326'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70326&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41552958/'&gt;41552958&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cancer patients have an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Consequently, anticoagulants such as rivaroxaban are often prescribed. With the increasing use of targeted therapies, there is a growing concern about potential drug-drug interactions, as these therapies can affect metabolic enzymes and transporters (i.e., cytochrome P450 3A and P-glycoprotein). When used in combination with rivaroxaban, these interactions may elevate a patient's risk of thromboembolic events or bleeding. Our primary objective was to investigate the effect of sotorasib on the pharmacokinetics of rivaroxaban and determine the safety of this combination in healthy volunteers. In an open label, single-sequence, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction study in healthy subjects, the influence of a once-daily 960 mg dose sotorasib for a period of 14 days was evaluated on the pharmacokinetics of a single 20 mg dose rivaroxaban. This clinical study followed the FDA guidance on drug interaction studies. A clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction was considered absent if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the geometric mean ratios for Cmax and AUC0-∞ were within the no-effect boundaries of 0.70-1.43. A total of 20 healthy subjects completed the study. The geometric mean ratios 1.00 (90% CI 0.90-1.12) for Cmax and 0.79 (90% CI 0.73-0.86) for AUC0-∞ fell inside the predefined criteria, indicating no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction. In addition, rivaroxaban and sotorasib were well tolerated by the healthy subjects. These results suggest that rivaroxaban can be safely co-administered without the need for switching to another treatment or dose adjustments in patients treated with sotorasib.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vannier AGL, Kondamuri NS, Wu MS, Allen J, Rama N, Nordgren R, Agrawal N, LoSavio PS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70163'&gt;10.1002/hed.70163&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41552947/'&gt;41552947&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may contribute to fatigue in head and neck cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy, particularly as both have the potential to impact the mechanics and dynamics of the airway. We conducted a scoping review and exploratory meta-analysis to evaluate the risk of OSA following chemoradiation. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies assessing incident OSA after radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Eligible studies isolated the effect of one treatment and reported OSA rates in each group. RESULTS: Of 559 papers identified, 110 were duplicates and 30 underwent full-text review; 13 met criteria for exploratory meta-analysis. A modest, nonsignificant trend toward increased risk of mild OSA was observed with radiotherapy (z = 1.42, p = 0.15). Chemotherapy was not associated with mild (z = -0.83, p = 0.41) or moderate (z = 0.00, p = 1.00) OSA. CONCLUSIONS: Studies are limited in size and number, and do not support increased risk of OSA with radiotherapy.</description>

METHODS: Using 16S rRNA sequencing of saliva from 21 MD-PV patients, 26 LR-MMP patients, and 14 healthy controls (HC), we analyzed microbial diversity, differential taxa (LEfSe), and functional potential (PICRUSt2/BugBase). RESULTS: Both patient groups showed significant microbial restructuring without major richness changes, featuring increased Firmicutes and decreased Proteobacteria. Disease-specific signatures included Flavobacteriia enrichment in MD-PV and Coriobacteriia/Actinobacteria in LR-MMP. Shared metabolic alterations involved "Biosynthesis of amino acids," "Phosphotransferase system," and "Ribosome" pathways, while distinct activations included "all-trans-farnesol biosynthesis" in MD-PV and "peptidoglycan biosynthesis" in LR-MMP. Phenotype prediction revealed increased Gram-positive bacteria and reduced pathogenic and stress-tolerant taxa. Microbial dysbiosis scores positively correlated with clinical disease severity. CONCLUSION: Our study identifies distinct oral microbial dysbiosis patterns in MD-PV and LR-MMP, with conserved functional shifts and disease-specific metabolic adaptations. The microbiota-severity correlation highlights its potential role in disease mechanisms, offering new insights for therapeutic exploration.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chansaenroj J, Phattarataratip E, Osathanon T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral diseases | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.70205'&gt;10.1111/odi.70205&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41549300/'&gt;41549300&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to retrospectively analyze the prevalence and clinical characteristics of TUGSE and explore the potential role of viral agents in these lesions. METHODS: Fifty-seven TUGSE and 50 non-specific ulcer patients were included. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were screened by PCR for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (hCMV), human papillomavirus (HPV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). RESULTS: The majority of TUGSE patients were in their sixth (29.8%) and seventh (24.6%) decades of life, with a 1:1.6 male-to-female ratio. The tongue is the most common site (47.4%), followed by buccal mucosa (28.1%). The average duration was 13.5 weeks, and almost one-fourth of the lesions were clinically diagnosed as oral squamous cell carcinoma (24.6%). TUGSE showed a significantly higher propensity to harbor macrophage infiltrates and inflammatory involvement with skeletal muscle fibers or salivary gland tissues, compared to non-specific ulcers. EBV was observed in two TUGSE cases (3.5%) and one patient with a non-specific ulcer (2.0%). Other viral agents were undetectable in TUGSE. CONCLUSION: TUGSE frequently affects the elderly population with a female predilection. The observed low prevalence of viral agents suggests that these pathogens may not play a direct role in TUGSE development.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Monga V, Okuno S, Van Tine B, Pollack SM, Weiss M, Hirbe A, Viveiros P, Schulte B, Attia S, Siontis B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Lancet. Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00654-0'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00654-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41554272/'&gt;41554272&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The prognosis for patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas remains poor. Evidence shows that a combination of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapy inhibit tumour growth. We aimed to investigate the dual targeting of VEGF and MET pathways with cabozantinib and temozolomide in patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma and other soft tissue sarcomas. METHODS: This multicentre, single-arm, lead-in phase 2 trial was conducted at five academic Sarcoma Centers of Excellence of the Midwest Sarcoma Trials Partnership in the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older, had histologically-confirmed unresectable or metastatic uterine and non-uterine leiomyosarcoma (cohort 1) and other soft tissue sarcomas (cohort 2; exploratory), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-1, up to five previous chemotherapy regimens, adequate organ and bone marrow function, and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.1). Patients received oral cabozantinib 40 mg (as a starting dose) once per day and temozolomide 150 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of a 28-day cycle for cycle one. Starting from cycle two, temozolomide was escalated to 200 mg/m2 on days 1-5 of each cycle, if the absolute neutrophil count was more than 1·5 × 109/L and platelet count was more than 100·0 × 109/L, and treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable drug-related adverse events. The primary endpoint in cohort 1 was progression-free survival at 12 weeks, assessed in the intention-to-treat population (defined as all enrolled patients). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04200443 (completed accrual). FINDINGS: Between Jan 17, 2020, and Feb 6, 2023, 96 patients were assessed for eligibility, 24 were ineligible, and 72 were enrolled. The median age at enrolment was 59 years (IQR 52-66) in cohort 1 (n=42) and 63 years (50-69) in cohort 2 (n=30), with a median follow-up of 18·0 months (17·5-20·7). 42 (58%) of 72 patients were female and 30 (42%) were male. In cohort 1, progression-free survival at 12 weeks was reached by 31 (74%) of 42 patients who were still receiving cabozantinib and temozolomide. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression-free survival was higher due to censoring and not requiring patients to be receiving treatment at 12 weeks (79·4% [95% CI 68·6-86·8]). 20 (48%) patients in cohort 1 and 23 (77%) in cohort 2 had died due to disease progression at the end of the study. 71 (99%) of 72 patients had grade 1 or higher treatment-related adverse events. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events attributed to either one or both drugs were platelet count decrease (22 [30%]), neutrophil count decrease (13 [18%]), hypertension (seven [10%]), and diarrhoea (six [8%]). There were no treatment-related deaths. INTERPRETATION: Cabozantinib with temozolomide showed a meaningful clinical benefit and could potentially be a viable treatment option for patients with unresectable or metastatic leiomyosarcoma. Treatment was tolerable and did not reveal any new safety signals. FUNDING: Exelixis.</description>

Targeting both the synthesis and clearance of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins is a promising approach. Liver X receptor (LXR) repression can reduce plasma TG and cholesterol and improve insulin sensitivity by suppressing de novo lipogenesis and intestinal lipid absorption and enhancing clearance of TG-rich lipoproteins, but its clinical utility remains unexplored. Here we demonstrate the role of LXR inverse agonists in lipid metabolism and metabolic diseases in preclinical models and humans. Given concerns that systemic LXR repression may impair reverse cholesterol transport, we developed TLC-2716, an orally administered, gut- and liver-restricted LXR inverse agonist. In human liver organoids modeling steatohepatitis, TLC-2716 reduced lipid accumulation and suppressed inflammation and fibrotic gene expression. In a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 1 clinical trial, 14-day treatment with TLC-2716 was well tolerated (primary endpoints) and resulted in placebo-adjusted reductions up to 38.5% in plasma TG and 61% in postprandial remnant cholesterol (secondary endpoints). In conclusion, these results highlight the tolerability and therapeutic potential of TLC-2716 as a treatment for managing dyslipidemia and reducing residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk in humans.

The differential diagnoses of the observed bony changes, with special attention to the clival alterations, are presented. During the macromorphological, radiological, and digital microscopic examination of MMG3-75, the skull base showed mild cortical erosion and multiple, well-circumscribed osteolytic lesions at the clivus clearly evidenced by 3D imaging. In addition, endocranial granular impressions and abnormal blood vessel impressions were observed in multiple locations on the inner skull surface. Based on the differential diagnosis of the clival changes and their co-occurrence with endocranial alterations indicative of tuberculous meningitis (granular impressions and abnormal blood vessel impressions), they were most likely due to tuberculous involvement of the skull base. Additional aDNA analysis provided no evidence for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in MMG3-75. To the best of our knowledge, MMG3-75 is the first reported archaeological case of tuberculous clival osteomyelitis with associated meningitis, giving us a unique insight into the occurrence of an extremely rare manifestation of tuberculosis in mediaeval Hungary.</description>

More recently, P. gingivalis has been implicated in various systemic conditions, including atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cancer, such as pancreatic and oral cancer. This bacterium employs several mechanisms to evade environmental stress, thereby contributing to its pathogenicity. The viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state is characterized by bacteria that remain viable but have reduced metabolic activity and are unable to form colonies on conventional culture media. To induce the VBNC state in P. gingivalis, we subjected the bacterium to oxidative stress using H2O2 and subsequently resuscitated it from this state with sodium pyruvate. We utilized viability staining, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry (FC) to count live and dead bacteria, confirming the presence of significant numbers of viable P. gingivalis cells both before and after stress induction. Despite being viable, the stressed P. gingivalis failed to form colonies on blood agar plates after seven days of incubation, indicating it had entered the VBNC state. We were then able to resuscitate the VBNC P. gingivalis by adding sodium pyruvate, and the growth of the resuscitated bacteria on plates was comparable to that of control P. gingivalis. Investigation into the invasiveness of P. gingivalis in the VBNC state was conducted using human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). P. gingivalis in the VBNC state demonstrated the ability to invade and based on live/dead staining, showed that a substantial proportion of the VBNC P. gingivalis remained viable within the host cells for extended periods. In this study, we explore the VBNC survival strategy previously described in many aerobic bacteria but not previously reported in anaerobes such as P. gingivalis. The objectives of this study are to verify the VBNC state in P. gingivalis, determine whether this state can be reversed and assess the extent to which it impacts the ability of P. gingivalis to invade host cells. Understanding the VBNC and resuscitation states will be instrumental in guiding the development of more effective therapies for periodontitis and other diseases associated with P. gingivalis infection.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vidakovic R, Zigante M, Kelmendi J, Spalj S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0340828'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0340828&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41544055/'&gt;41544055&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To explore how age and gender shape the relationship between personality traits, quality of life (QoL), and a patient's decision to undergo surgery for correction of dentofacial deformity. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 108 individuals aged 14-53 years (median age 18 years; interquartile range 17-26) with a moderate to very great need for surgery according to the Index of Orthognathic Functional Treatment Need were assessed. There were 43% adolescents (≤17 years) and 68% females. Participants completed validated questionnaires measuring personality characteristics (Big Five Inventory, Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, and Self-Esteem Scale), along with the Orthognathic Quality of Life Questionnaire. The decision to accept or refuse surgery was recorded. RESULTS: Overall, 51% of patients accepted surgery (48% of females and 57% of males). Adults were more likely to accept surgery than adolescents (61% vs. 37%; p = 0.019, V = 0.241; odds ratio 2.7; 95% confidence interval 1.2-5.9). In adults, lower self-esteem (SE) (p = 0.034, r = 0.270) and higher perfectionism (p = 0.012; r = 0.320), particularly concern over mistakes (CM) (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.469) and personal standards (p = 0.004; r = 0.370), were associated with acceptance. Among adolescents, personality traits showed no significant effect. However, in both age groups, impaired oral function (OF) (p = 0.013; r = 0.368 for adolescents and p = 0.006; r = 0.348 for adults) and greater facial esthetics concern (FE) (p = 0.018; r = 0.350 and p = 0.015; r = 0.310) influenced surgery acceptance. Males who accepted surgery had higher awareness of deformity than those who refused (p = 0.006; r = 0.463), while females who accepted surgery had lower SE (p = 0.044; r = 0.235). In both males and females FE was higher in those who accepted surgery (p = 0.009; r = 0.439 for males and p = 0.006; r = 0.320 for females), OF (p &lt; 0.001; r = 0.597 and p = 0.003; r = 0.342), and CM (p = 0.030; r = 0.367 and p = 0.006; r = 0.325). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between personality traits, QoL, and the decision to undergo orthognathic surgery was more strongly influenced by age than by gender. OF and FE influenced acceptance across all age and gender groups, while personality-related factors were particularly relevant among adults.</description>

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of, and patient behavior associated with chemo-mechanical caries removal versus conventional drilling in children aged 6-12 years. METHODS: A split-mouth randomized clinical trial was conducted involving 66 molar teeth. The effectiveness of Papacarie Duo Gel and conventional drilling methods was assessed using colony-forming unit (CFU) counts before and after each treatment. Cavity preparation time and intraoperative patient behavior using the Frankl Behavior Rating Scale were also evaluated. RESULTS: Both methods resulted in a significant reduction in bacterial counts post-treatment. However, conventional drilling showed a greater percentage reduction in bacterial load (82.9 ± 13.9; t = -4.42, p &lt; 0.001) compared to the chemo-mechanical method (68.6 ± 16.6). The mean caries removal time was 692.4 ± 245.9 sec with the chemo-mechanical method, compared to 266.9 ± 101.6 sec with conventional drilling. In terms of behavior, 57.6% of the children exhibited a positive response during chemo-mechanical treatment whereas negative behavior was more commonly observed with conventional drilling. CONCLUSION: While conventional drilling remains the better-established and time-efficient method of caries removal, the chemo-mechanical technique serves as a valuable alternative for managing children, reducing anxiety and promoting greater comfort and cooperation during treatment.

The therapeutic and preventive effects of glycyrrhizin (GL), a compound known for its anti-inflammatory properties, remain unclear due to the lack of appropriate animal models, especially for prevention studies. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic and preventive effects of GL and determine the optimal concentrations using two hamster models (stomatitis-initiation model and stomatitis-healing model) representing the initiation and healing phases of RAS. The effects were evaluated through macroscopic and histological analyses, gene expression profiling in hamster buccal tissues, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) assays in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human oral keratinocytes. In the stomatitis-healing model, a low concentration of GL (0.0065%) significantly increased the cure rate and histologically reduced the numbers of vessels and lymphocytes. In the stomatitis-initiation model, low concentrations of GL (0.0065% and 0.033%) significantly decreased the edema score and histologically reduced the numbers of vessels and neutrophils, as well as the mRNA expression levels of interleukin-6 and cyclooxygenase-2. In contrast, a high concentration of GL (0.33%) showed inferior efficacy compared with low concentrations in both models. Similarly, in LPS-stimulated human oral keratinocytes, low GL concentrations suppressed PGE₂ protein expression, while the highest concentration increased it. These findings show that GL promotes healing and prevents the onset of stomatitis at specific concentrations, underscoring the importance of optimal dosing and supporting the potential clinical application of GL in the management of RAS.</description>

We analyzed baseline HR-HPV-positive participants from the control arm of a bivalent HPV-16/18 vaccine trial in China, with follow-up over 5.5 years. Cox regression and competing risk models were applied to evaluate the progression, clearance, and persistence of these HR-HPV infections. Among 534 HR-HPV-positive women at baseline, 98 CIN2+ lesions were identified (52 at baseline, 46 during follow-up). HPV-16 and HPV-31 exhibited the highest immediate CIN2+ risk (21.1%), followed by HPV-33 (17.1%) and HPV-58 (12.7%). When stratified by baseline cytology, the LSIL+ group showed the highest immediate risk of CIN2+ (29.5% among the HR-HPV-positive participants), followed by the ASC-US (10.5%). In the longitudinal analysis, competing risk models revealed significant type-specific differences in progression (Gray's test P = 0.0158) and clearance (Gray's test P &lt;0.0001). HPV-16, -31, -18, and -58 showed relatively high progression (27.1%, 19.2%, 16.1%, and 11.2%) and low clearance (72.9%, 69.2%, 83.9%, and 88.8%). CIN2+ risk was strongly genotype-dependent; beyond HPV-16/18, types -31, -33, and -58 also warrant particular attention in screening and clinical management. Additionally, although a slightly higher CIN2+ progression risk was observed in younger women compared to older women, the difference was not statistically significant (Gray's test P = 0.4389), indicating the need for confirmation in larger studies. These findings enhance the understanding of the natural history of type-specific HR-HPV and age-specific progression in initially screen-positive populations.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mandibular first molar typodont model with a chamfer finish line was prepared and scanned ten times, resulting in ten STL files. The finish line for each file was detected using both automatic and semi-automatic methods in two software programs: the CEREC InLab system and Dentbird software. The internal and marginal gaps were measured at four locations: mesial, distal, buccal, and lingual- using the silicone replica technique. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc analyses (α = 0.05) were performed to detect statistical differences in the marginal and internal gaps among the groups. RESULTS: The results revealed significant differences in internal and marginal gaps between the automatic methods of the Dentbird software and the CEREC system (p &lt; 0.05). However, no significant differences were found in the semi-automatic methods between the two systems (p &gt; 0.05). Although the fits of crowns automatically designed by Dentbird software were inferior to those of the semi-automatic method by Dentbird software and the CEREC In Lab system, the values of all four groups were within the clinically acceptable range (&lt;120 µm). CONCLUSION: The internal and marginal fit of crowns designed using the automatic and semi-automatic modes in Dentbird, a freely available CAD platform, fell within the range of traditional clinical acceptability. Hence, automatically generated crowns may be considered appropriate for immediate provisional applications, the semi-autonomic finishing line detection can be used for long term crowns in clinical practice.</description>

Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00662-X'&gt;10.1016/S1470-2045(25)00662-X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41548565/'&gt;41548565&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Combined targeting of angiogenic and immune pathways is an emerging strategy in clear cell carcinomas arising from the gynaecological tract (CCGCs), given the unique molecular and microenvironmental features of this gynaecological cancer. We aimed to evaluate the preliminary activity and safety of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in patients with recurrent CCGC. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial (LARA) across three tertiary hospitals in Singapore and South Korea. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with histologically confirmed CCGC, which had progressed or recurred after at least one previous line of platinum-based chemotherapy; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score of 0-1; and no previous exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy were eligible for inclusion. Patients received 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab every 3 weeks plus 20 mg oral lenvatinib daily, until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurred first, for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was objective response rate in the first 24 weeks of treatment, as per investigator-assessed Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST; version 1.1), analysed by modified intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04699071) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between March 26, 2021, and Oct 10, 2023, 30 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 27 (90%) participants received at least one dose of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib. 25 (83%) patients were included in the primary outcome analysis. Median participant age was 52 years (IQR 40-66). Among the 27 patients, 12 (44%) were Chinese, 12 (44%) were Korean, two (7%) were Malay, and one (4%) was Filipino. 24 (89%) patients had primary ovarian clear cell carcinoma; three (11%) had primary endometrial cancer. All tumours had proficient mismatch repair or microsatellite stability. At data cutoff on March 19, 2025, median follow-up was 21middot;0 months (IQR 12middot;5-25middot;2). Ten of 25 patients had confirmed objective response within 24 weeks (objective response rate at 24 weeks 40% [95% CI 21-61]). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 14 (52%) of 27 patients, the most common of which were hypertension (six [22%] patients), decreased platelet count (two [7%]), elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST; two [7%]), and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT; two [7%]). Serious adverse events occurred in five (19%) patients, the most common of which were immune-related hepatitis in two (7%) patients and decreased platelet count in two (7%) patients. No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib showed promising anti-tumour activity and manageable safety in patients with recurrent CCGC, including in patients with disease progression following previous treatment with anti-angiogenic therapy. These findings support further evaluation of this combination in randomised controlled trials.

We conducted a phase II study of erdafitinib, alone or with cetrelimab, in FGFR-altered mUC. METHODS: Adults with mUC and select FGFR alterations who are ineligible for cisplatin were randomly assigned 1:1 in a noncomparative design to once-daily erdafitinib 8 mg (with pharmacodynamically guided uptitration to 9 mg) or erdafitinib 8 mg plus intravenous cetrelimab 240 mg once every 2 weeks at cycles 1-4 and 480 mg once every 4 weeks thereafter. Primary end points were investigator-assessed confirmed overall response rate (ORR) and safety; secondary end points included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). No statistical hypotheses were tested. RESULTS: At data cutoff, 87 patients were randomly assigned and treated (erdafitinib, n = 43; erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, n = 44). Of 64 patients with PD-L1 expression data, 56 (87.5%) had low levels of PD-L1 expression (combined positive score &lt;10). Median survival follow-up was 14.2 months. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib was 44.2% (95% CI, 29.1 to 60.1) with one complete response (CR); median DOR and median OS were 9.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to not estimable [NE]) and 16.2 months (95% CI, 8.3 to NE), respectively. Investigator-assessed confirmed ORR for erdafitinib plus cetrelimab was 54.5% (95% CI, 38.8 to 69.6), with six (13.6%) CRs; median DOR and median OS were 11.1 months (95% CI, 8.8 to NE) and 20.8 months (95% CI, 12.0 to NE), respectively. The most frequent treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hyperphosphatemia (83.7% and 68.2% in erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab groups, respectively), stomatitis (69.8% and 56.8%), and dry mouth (37.2% and 56.8%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 46.5% and 45.5% of patients receiving erdafitinib and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab, respectively. CONCLUSION: First-line erdafitinib monotherapy and erdafitinib plus cetrelimab demonstrated antitumor activity and a manageable safety profile in cisplatin-ineligible patients with mUC.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Waliany S, Cooper AJ, Liu SV, Gautschi O, Rotow JK, Smith KER, Weber UM, Lee DH, Loong HHF, Patel JD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-4382'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-4382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41537704/'&gt;41537704&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Rearranged during transfection (RET) alterations are oncogenic drivers across solid tumors. Selective RET inhibitors (SRIs) selpercatinib and pralsetinib have transformed outcomes for patients with RET-altered malignancies. Limited knowledge exists on genomic mechanisms of resistance to SRIs. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We established 'RETgistry,' a global consortium of patients with advanced RET-altered solid tumors who received SRIs and underwent post-progression tissue or plasma biopsies assessed by next-generation sequencing. Frequencies of secondary RET resistance mutations and acquired non-RET gene alterations were determined. Progression-free survival (PFS) and time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) on first SRI were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: RETgistry included 109 patients with RET-altered advanced solid tumors (lung: n=94; thyroid: n=15) who underwent 143 post-SRI progression biopsies (tissue: 91; plasma: 52). Median PFS and TTD were 13.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.1-16.6) and 17.3 months (95% CI 14.0-20.2), respectively. Secondary RET mutations were detected in 20 (14.0%) biopsies (lung cancer: 15 [12.4%], thyroid carcinoma: 5 [22.7%]). Common acquired off-target alterations involved MET (18.2%; amplification: 15.0%), TP53 (8.2%), APC (7.6%), KRAS (7.1%), KEAP1 (5.9%), and CDKN2A/B (5.3%). MET alterations were enriched in post-SRI versus pre-SRI specimens (full cohort: 17.6% vs 2.0%, p=0.022; lung cancer: 19.1% vs 2.1%, p=0.022). CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of secondary RET mutations after SRIs was low, underscoring greater role for off-target resistance. Recurrent acquired alterations involving tumor suppressor genes or upstream regulators of MAPK and PI3K pathways were identified, most commonly MET amplification. Continued efforts to characterize SRI resistance biology are critical to guide development of novel therapeutic strategies.</description>

GLP-1 receptor agonists reduce risks for major adverse cardiovascular events (eg, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death), and the risk of admission to or treatment within hospital for heart failure. These drugs reduce albuminuria and slow the decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate over time, therefore delaying or preventing kidney failure. Furthermore, GLP-1 receptor agonists (eg, liraglutide and semaglutide) and the dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide have been approved for treatment of obesity, with clinical trials establishing benefits for various obesity-related conditions: prevention of type 2 diabetes; risk for major adverse cardiovascular events; heart failure, especially with preserved ejection fraction; regression of steatosis and prevention of fibrosis in steatotic liver disease; and symptomatic improvements in obstructive sleep apnoea and knee osteoarthritis. Current developments include the exploration of novel indications (eg, neurodegenerative diseases and substance use disorders) with suggestive evidence of efficacy, and the development of small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists for oral treatment to improve convenience. Dual (ie, GLP-1-glucagon and GLP-1-amylin) and triple (ie, GIP-GLP-1-glucagon) receptor agonists activating multiple receptors promise greater efficacy than mono-agonists, especially for weight loss. However, some clinical development programmes have a high burden of adverse gastrointestinal events, and dose-escalation regimens should be optimised to reach acceptable tolerability.</description>

The expression, prognostic, single-cell value, immune cell infiltration, and immune check-point (ICI) of TRPV1 in pan-cancer were assessed. Functional assays were performed to evaluate the effect of TRPV1 in vitro. TRPV1 was significantly upregulated in 13 cancers, and was closely correlated with poor prognosis. Moreover, the expression of TRPV1 was significantly correlated with the infiltration of immune cells and ICI. Cellular function and western blot experiments revealed that TRPV1 may be required for cancer cell migration in head and neck cancer and lung cancer by inhibition of PI3K/AKT and promotion of immune cell infiltration and autophage. Our study suggests that TRPV1 may be able to regulate the tumor microenvironment by regulating immune-related physiological activities and thereby regulating the occurrence and progression of cancers. Thus, TRPV1 could be used to develop new-targeted drugs for cancers.</description>

Current evidence-based treatments for AN have limited efficacy, with less than half of the patients achieving full recovery in long-term follow-up studies. Recent findings have identified gut microbiota (GM) dysbiosis as a potential contributor to AN pathology through the gut-brain axis. This open-label, non-randomized, feasibility trial (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT05834010) evaluated the feasibility of utilizing fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to modify the GM and GM-associated signaling in females with AN and to examine biological effects following a single FMT procedure. Adult female participants diagnosed with AN were recruited. FMT was administered either orally via capsules or as rectal enema. Stool and blood samples were collected pre- and one week post-FMT to assess GM composition, hormonal changes, and biomarkers. Primary endpoints: Feasibility of FMT in individuals with AN and preferred route of FMT. Secondary endpoints: A single FMT treatment can alter GM composition in individuals with AN short term and relevant gut brain signaling in serum. 18/22 participants (81%) completed FMT and sampling and 19/22 participants chose oral capsules, with no serious adverse effects reported. GM analysis showed significant shifts toward donor composition 1-week post-FMT, with improved stool consistency. No significant changes were observed in psychopathology measures or appetite-related biomarkers. Oral FMT is a feasible intervention for adult women with AN, leading to changes in GM profile. Future studies should focus on placebo-controlled trials to assess the efficacy of repeated oral treatments and explore long-term effects on GM, appetite, body weight, sex hormones, disorder-specific symptoms, and overall well-being.</description>

Pathogenic LINE-1 (pL1HS) retrotransposons promote LUSC progression by fostering immune evasion. Elucidation of the mechanistic link between retrotransposon activity and TME reprogramming could help identify strategies to stimulate anti-tumor immunity. Here, we conducted integrated multi-omics analyses, including bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with proteomics, that revealed hyperactivated cGAS-STING signaling and a myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC)-rich TME in pL1HS+ LUSC. Mechanistically, LINE-1 open reading frame 1 protein (L1-ORF1p) underwent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) via its intrinsically disordered region, forming cytosolic condensates that scaffolded pL1HS nucleic acid, HMGN2, and cGAS into a ternary complex. This complex sustained chronic non-canonical NF-κB signaling-dependent cGAS-STING activation, which in turn drove immune suppression via MDSCs recruitment and activation. The coiled-coil domain of L1-ORF1p stabilized these condensates by binding HMGN2, perpetuating this immunosuppressive cascade. Dual targeting of pL1HS and cGAS restored anti-tumor immunity and suppressed tumor growth in preclinical models. Together, this work reveals a therapeutically actionable LLPS-driven axis that can be targeted with a combinatorial strategy to overcome immune evasion in LUSC, thereby addressing a critical unmet clinical need.</description>

Despite advancement in endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), there are currently no established guidelines delineating the appropriate surgical extent for defining adequate ESS in cases of primary diffuse CRS. METHODS: Through a modified Delphi technique, 33 statements regarding the extent of surgery for each paranasal sinus were drafted following a literature review and submitted to an expert panel composed of 15 internationally recognized ESS experts. A consensus meeting was held to discuss the results for each iteration. An additional statement was added during the meeting, and a total of 34 statements were voted on during the last round. RESULTS: Consensus was reached in 17 statements out of 34. Type 1 medial maxillary antrostomy, bilateral anteroposterior ethmoidectomy, and at least DRAF I frontal sinusotomy should be performed in all cases of primary diffuse CRS, with a particular focus on mucosal sparing, regardless of the likelihood of subsequently needing biologic therapy. DRAF III frontal sinusotomy should not be considered as a first-line approach even in patients with risk factors for recurrence. Treatment of the sphenoid sinus might be avoided in cases where it is not involved by the pathology. CONCLUSION: This document outlines a consensus on the appropriate surgical approach for primary diffuse CRS, aiming to promote standardization while preserving individual clinical judgment.</description>

However, emerging evidence from other organ systems suggests mucosal and muscle compartments engage in reciprocal interactions with functional consequences. We hypothesized that similar crosstalk exists in the VF, whereby fibrotic mucosa influences adjacent muscle. To model this process, we stimulated human VF fibroblasts (HVOX) with TGF-β1, a central mediator of fibrosis, and examined the effects on rat VF myoblasts (rVF-Mbs), as well as reciprocal influences of rVF-Mbs on fibroblasts. METHODS: HVOX fibroblasts were stimulated with 10 ng/mL TGF-β1, and the effects on rVF-Mbs were assessed using conditioned media and co-culture. Myotube formation was evaluated by immunofluorescence, and nuclear localization of Smad2/3 was examined in conditioned media experiments. qRT-PCR quantified transcripts related to myogenic differentiation and Smad2/3 signaling. ALK4/5 inhibition was performed in co-culture to test TGF-β/Smad2/3-signaling pathway involvement. Reciprocal effects were examined by changes in fibrogenic gene expression in HVOX fibroblasts. RESULTS: Both conditioned media and co-culture suppressed myogenic differentiation in rVF-Mbs; increased inhibition was observed in co-culture, as indicated by reduced myotube formation, decreased Myh2 expression, and activation of Smad2/3 signaling. ALK4/5 inhibition abrogated these effects. Differentiating rVF-Mbs attenuated the fibrogenic phenotype of HVOX fibroblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Fibrotic VF mucosal cells can impair myogenic differentiation through TGF-β/Smad2/3-mediated fibroblast-myoblast crosstalk, and myogenic cells may exert reciprocal anti-fibrotic effects. These findings suggest mucosa-muscle interactions may contribute to VF pathology and highlight Smad2/3 as a potential therapeutic target. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: NA STUDY DESIGN: In vitro.</description>

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of savolitinib-osimertinib versus standard of care platinum-based doublet chemotherapy in this patient population. METHODS: SACHI was a multicentre, randomised, active-controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial conducted across 68 Chinese hospitals. Eligible adults with locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC and MET amplification after EGFR TKI failure were randomly assigned (1:1) to once daily oral savolitinib-osimertinib or intravenous chemotherapy (pemetrexed plus either cisplatin or carboplatin), both in 21-day cycles. Central randomisation was implemented through an interactive web-response system with stratification based on the presence of brain metastases, previous exposure to third-generation EGFR TKIs, and EGFR mutation subtype, using a mixed block-size methodology. The primary endpoint, investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1, was tested using a hierarchical procedure: first in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive population, and if positive, the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Safety analysis was performed in all patients who received at least one dose of the study treatment. Interim analysis data cutoff was Aug 30, 2024. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05015608) and is complete. FINDINGS: Between Oct 15, 2021, and Aug 30, 2024, 211 patients were enrolled, 106 were randomly assigned to savolitinib-osimertinib and 105 were randomly assigned to chemotherapy, including 137 (65%) of 211 who were third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (69 in the savolitinib-osimertinib group; 68 in the chemotherapy group). In 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group, the median age was 59·4 years (IQR 54·3-65·8), 62 (58%) were female, and 44 (42%) were male. In 105 patients in the chemotherapy group, the median age was 61·9 years (IQR 56·3-69·1), 55 (52%) were female, and 50 (48%) were male. All participants were Asian. Median PFS was significantly prolonged with savolitinib-osimertinib versus chemotherapy in the third-generation EGFR TKI-naive (9·8 months [95% CI 6·9-12·5] vs 5·4 months [4·2-6·0]; hazard ratio 0·34 [0·21-0·56]; p&lt;0·0001) and ITT populations (8·2 months [6·9-11·2] vs 4·5 months [3·0-5·4]; 0·34 [0·23-0·49]; p&lt;0·0001). Grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in the same proportion of patients in both groups who received the study drugs (60 [57%] of 106 patients in the savolitinib-osimertinib group and 55 [57%] of 96 patients in the chemotherapy group). INTERPRETATION: The savolitinib-osimertinib combination improved PFS versus chemotherapy in patients with EGFR mutation-positive, MET-amplified NSCLC that had progressed on EGFR TKI therapy, while maintaining a favourable tolerability profile. This regimen offers a potential oral treatment option for this biomarker-selected population. FUNDING: HUTCHMED and AstraZeneca.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 300 patients aged over 65 with inoperable ESCC who underwent IMRT. Patients were randomly allocated to a training set (n = 211) and a validation set (n = 89) in a 7:3 ratio. Prognostic variables were initially screened using univariate Cox regression, followed by variable selection via the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Independent predictors were identified through multivariate Cox analysis and incorporated into a nomogram model. Model performance was evaluated using the concordance index, receiver operating characteristic curves, and calibration curves, with the model's discriminative ability further validated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: Four independent prognostic factors were identified: age ≥ 70 years (HR = 1.50, P = 0.019), Karnofsky performance status score ≥ 80 (HR = 0.54, P = 0.003), radiotherapy dose ≥ 58 Gy (HR = 0.53, P &lt; 0.001), and serum albumin ≥ 40 g/L (HR = 0.70, P = 0.041). The nomogram demonstrated predictive ability for 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS), with better predictive performance for 5-year OS. The area under the curve values in the training cohort were 0.732 and 0.681, while those in the validation cohort were 0.570 and 0.740, respectively. Calibration and decision curve analyses confirmed the clinical utility and accuracy of the model. Compared to the AJCC 8th edition TNM staging system, the nomogram exhibited superior long-term prognostic performance in this population. CONCLUSION: This study proposes a clinical nomogram model to assist clinicians in predicting the survival of elderly patients with inoperable ESCC undergoing IMRT and formulating treatment plans.</description>

We evaluated the associations between oral broad-spectrum and narrow-spectrum antibiotic use and eoCRC. METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within Kaiser Permanente Southern California. Cases were persons aged 15-49 years with in situ or invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma (2009-2021); controls were individually matched 10:1 on age, sex, and length of KPSC membership. Those with ≥15 years of membership were included to assess exposure 2-15 years earlier. Data were collected from electronic health records. Crude and multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to evaluate antibiotic use from 10-14.9, 5-9.9, and 2-4.9 years before diagnosis/index date with risk of overall CRC, colon, and rectal cancer. RESULTS: A total of 295 cases and 2,794 controls were included. In the 10-14.9 years before diagnosis/index date, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics was not associated with eoCRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for any use=1.07 (95% CI: 0.82-1.40)]; aOR for &gt;90 days cumulative use =1.40 (0.82-2.38)]. An elevated risk of colon adenocarcinoma was suggested for &gt; 90 days cumulative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics [aOR=2.04 (1.09-3.85)]. No clear association was observed for broad-spectrum antibiotic use within 5-9.9 or 2-4.9 years prior to diagnosis or with rectal cancer during any period, or for narrow-spectrum antibiotics in any exposure window. CONCLUSIONS: An association between long-term cumulative use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and early-onset colon cancer is suggested. IMPACT: Further investigation into antibiotics and eoCRC risk by duration of use and window of exposure is warranted.</description>

In this context, psychological strain can arise, but compared to large companies, SMEs face particular difficulties in implementing mental health promotion intervention. These difficulties partially originate in a profound lack of comprehensive research on the effectiveness and prospects of success of intervention strategies in SMEs. This study aims to close this gap by evaluating a stress management training for managers in SMEs (KMU-GO). Implementing established stress management strategies and making them more accessible within the SME context, the training aims to improve participants' psychological and physiological well-being. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with an intervention and a waitlist control group in Germany. The intervention comprised 1.5 days of stress management training and two refresher sessions, focusing on short- and long-term coping strategies and self-reflection. Based on a sample of N = 155 managers, we conducted a multilevel analysis of covariance on psychological measures, namely stress reactivity, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, changes in physiological stress indices (i.e., hair cortisol concentration and salivary alpha-amylase activity) were examined. RESULTS: Regarding the psychological measures, we found significant training effects six months after baseline. Twelve months after baseline, there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups for either psychological or physiological variables. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the present stress management training is effective in reducing psychological strain in SME managers. In order to achieve more sustainable effects, a continuation of the refresher sessions could be considered. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Before including the first participant, the KMU-GO trial is registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS): DRKS00023457 (registered on 5 November 2020).</description>

However, ESR1 mutations lead to ET resistance and subsequent disease progression (PD). Limitations of intramuscular fulvestrant have led to the development of novel oral selective estrogen receptor degraders (SERDs). We aim to evaluate efficacy and safety of novel oral SERDs for ER+/HER2- mBC. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral SERDs with standard treatment. Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) overall and by subgroups (ESR1 mutation, menopausal status, age, prior CDK4/6i use, visceral metastases), PFS comparing oral SERDs versus fulvestrant in ESR1-mutated patients, and grade ≥ 3 or discontinuation due to treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Hazard and risk ratios (HRs/RRs) were pooled using random-effects models (RStudio 2025.09.2 + 418). RESULTS: Eight RCTs (n = 3,978) were included. Overall, PFS did not differ significantly between groups (HR 0.80; 95 % CI 0.62-1.04; p = 0.09). Statistically significant PFS subgroups included: ESR1 mutation (HR 0.57; 95 % CI 0.45-0.73; p &lt; 0.01); prior CDK4/6i use (HR 0.68; 95 % CI 0.49-0.95; p = 0.03); visceral metastases (HR 0.78; 95 % CI 0.63-0.97; p = 0.03); age &lt; 65 years (HR 0.75; 95 % CI 0.60-0.92; p = 0.01); and oral SERDs versus fulvestrant (HR 0.55; 95 % CI 0.46-0.66; p &lt; 0.01). Grade ≥ 3 TRAEs were higher with SERDs (RR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.07-2.50; p = 0.03), while treatment discontinuation was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Novel oral SERDs may represent a paradigm shift in managing PD after 1 L therapy, showing potential to improve PFS in selected patients.</description>

OMD images also have insufficient supervision information and fuzzy lesion boundaries, failing to meet mobile medicine's high accuracy requirements. METHODS: To solve these issues, we proposed a weakly supervised OMD segmentation model with multi-task collaboration (WSSM). Using Mamba as the backbone, WSSM realizes efficient lesion segmentation via classification-segmentation dual-branch collaboration. The classification branch captures multi-directional, multi-scale features via a dedicated network, and its pseudo-label module fuses class activation maps, box annotations, and predictive annotations for deeper supervision. The segmentation branch adopts a symmetric network to extract overall lesion features, with a boundary adaptive module enhancing fuzzy boundary representation to improve accuracy. RESULTS: Experiments on the OMD dataset demonstrated that WSSM outperformed existing weakly supervised methods significantly, with its Dice index increasing by 6.06% compared to WSSL. CONCLUSIONS: Our model, with Mamba as the backbone (balancing local texture feature extraction and long-range semantic dependency modeling of OMD lesions), enables deeper supervision via dual-branch collaboration, significantly improving boundary segmentation accuracy in scenarios with insufficient OMD supervision and unclear boundaries.

However, distinguishing SjD-related dry mouth from idiopathic xerostomia (IX) remains challenging. This study evaluates whether elastography, an advanced ultrasonographic technique measuring gland stiffness, can improve differentiation. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 192 patients diagnosed with SjD (n = 83) or IX (n = 109) were assessed for xerostomia severity and underwent conventional, Doppler ultrasonography, and shear wave elastography (SWE) of salivary glands. Additional SjD-related indicators, including serological and pathological markers, were analyzed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified key differentiators, and generalized additive model (GAM) examined nonlinear associations. RESULTS: SjD patients showed significantly higher parotid gland stiffness (23.9 ± 10.9 kPa) compared to IX patients (15.1 ± 6.7 kPa, p &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, submandibular gland homogeneity and parotid stiffness were independent predictors of SjD. Multivariate analysis revealed parotid stiffness as the strongest factor associated with SjD (OR = 1.152 per kPa increase, 95% CI: 1.080-1.241). GAM analysis revealed a nonlinear exposure-response pattern, with the modeled proportion of SjD reaching approximately 50% at a parotid stiffness of 17.7 kPa. CONCLUSION: Parotid gland stiffness shows promise as a clinical tool for distinguishing SjD from IX.</description>

The aim of the present paper is to investigate the association between advanced stages of periodontitis (Stage III/IV) and the intensity and duration of sleep bruxism events, measured as bruxism work index (BWI) and bruxism time index (BTI) through surface electromyography. METHODS: Subjects were selected from patients regularly attending the School of Dentistry of the University of Siena, Siena, Italy, with the aim of having a test group of patients with periodontitis and a control group without periodontitis. Two calibrated operators performed the periodontal assessment. The sleep-time surface electromyographic activity of the left masseter muscle was registered through a portable device (dia-BRUXO, Biotech-Novations, Sanremo, Italy). Differences between cases and controls in the outcome variables concerning masseter activities were assessed. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between the two groups for the sleep bruxism work index and bruxism time index. Instead, a moderately negative significant correlation was found between the bruxism work index and the full mouth bleeding score. CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced stages of periodontitis (Stage III and Stage IV) do not exhibit a higher frequency and intensity of sleep bruxism events compared to healthy individuals.</description>

Despite advances in radiation techniques and surgical management, reliable predictors of ORN prognosis remain lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to measure the association between systemic inflammatory biomarkers and ORN prognosis. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, SAMPLE: This retrospective cohort study included patients with ORN treated between January 2010 and March 2022 at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine. Patients with unavailable blood test data were excluded. PREDICTOR VARIABLE: The predictor variables were pretreatment systemic inflammatory biomarkers, including neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). The cutoff values for NLR, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, and LMR were determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Each marker was calculated at the time of diagnosis of ORN. MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE: The outcome variable was prognosis. Subjects had a good prognosis if the ORN stage improved. The prognosis was poor if the ORN stage was stable or worse over time. COVARIATES: Sex, age, stage, onset region, primary tumor site, radiation dose, smoking history, medical history, steroid therapy, clinical symptoms, treatment methods, and computed tomography image findings were covariates. ANALYSES: Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test, Fisher's exact test, χ2 test, and Cox regression analysis. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; .05. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 75 subjects, of whom 16 (21.3%) had a poor prognosis. The median follow-up period was 88 (53 to 122) months. Bivariate analysis revealed that high NLR (P &lt; .01) and low LMR (P = .02) were significantly associated with poor prognosis. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, poor prognosis was significantly associated with advanced age (hazard ratio [HR], 5.33; 95% CI, 1.61 to 17.65; P &lt; .01), ORN stage 3, 4 (HR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.56; P &lt; .01), high NLR (HR, 14.78; 95% CI, 3.50 to 62.35; P &lt; .01), and periosteal reaction (HR, 19.15; 95% CI, 4.65 to 78.87; P &lt; .01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We identified high NLR as a risk factor for poor prognosis in ORN. High NLR is considered to reflect worse local tissue and systemic health.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen W, Chen B, Hu C, Wei Q, Chen J, Xue W, Liu S, Sun L, Zhang L, Fan S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1700236'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1700236&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41551148/'&gt;41551148&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The combination of immune checkpoint blockade and chemotherapy significantly improves survival when used as first-line treatment for advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Nonetheless, the safety profiles of various immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combination therapies remain inadequately characterized, particularly regarding the incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) and immune-related adverse events (irAEs). The research employed a network meta-analysis to systematically evaluate and contrast the toxicity profiles across various initial ICI-driven treatments for advanced Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODS: An extensive literature review was conducted across PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science to identify RCTs evaluating first-line immunotherapy in advanced ESCC. The search included all records from each database's inception to July 1, 2025. Primary endpoints included grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events(grade ≥3 trAEs), any-grade irAEs, and grade ≥3 irAEs. Secondary analyses focused on organ-specific irAEs, including immune-mediated rash, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and pneumonitis. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis to assess relative risks (RRs) and establish a treatment ranking based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) metrics, evaluating the comparative effectiveness of different therapeutic options. The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251113069). RESULTS: Seven randomized controlled trials involving 4,479 patients with advanced ESCC were included. In pairwise meta-analyses, ICI plus chemotherapy, compared with chemotherapy alone, increased the risk of grade ≥3 treatment-related adverse events (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.00-1.17), any-grade irAEs (RR 2.04, 95% CI 1.71-2.44), and grade ≥3 irAEs (RR 2.75, 95% CI 1.98-3.82). Immune-chemotherapy also significantly elevated the risks of immune-mediated rash, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism, whereas the increase in immune-mediated pneumonitis did not reach statistical significance. In Bayesian network meta-analyses, camrelizumab plus chemotherapy had the highest probability of being the regimen with the lowest risk of grade ≥3 trAEs(SCURA = 87.8%) and grade ≥3 irAEs(SCURA = 71.6%), while toripalimab plus chemotherapy ranked safest for any-grade irAEs(SCURA = 83.8%). CONCLUSIONS: First-line ICI-based regimens for advanced ESCC are associated with an increased risk of severe treatment-related and immune-related toxicities compared with chemotherapy alone, and their safety profiles differ substantially across regimens. Our SUCRA-based rankings provide a comparative overview of regimen-level toxicity that may assist clinicians in understanding relative safety trade-offs when selecting first-line therapy. These findings should be integrated with regimen-specific efficacy data, regulatory indications, PD-L1 status, comorbidities, and patient preferences, and are best interpreted as complementary safety evidence rather than stand-alone treatment recommendations.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu X, Chen S, Wang Y, Cao J, Niu Z, Jin Y, Pan X, Zhang Z, Liu T, Liang W, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1697550'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1697550&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41551147/'&gt;41551147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: This study aims to develop a CT radiomics-based predictive model integrating clinical characteristics to distinguish benign and malignant vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 208 patients with VCFs treated at our institution between January 2020 and November 2024. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 145) and a validation cohort (n = 63). CT images were obtained, and three-dimensional lesion regions were manually segmented. A total of 1,316 radiomics features were extracted. Dimensionality reduction was performed using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis and 5-fold cross-validation to identify key features. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used for identifying independent clinical predictors. Three models were constructed: a clinical model, a radiomics model, and a combined clinical-radiomics model. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Predictive efficacy and clinical utility were further assessed via ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA), along with clinical impact curves (CIC) and net reduction curves. The Delong test was used for statistical comparisons among different models, and a nomogram was developed to facilitate the visualization of the optimal model. RESULTS: Carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) and posterior vertebral involvement were identified as independent clinical predictors. The combined model achieved the highest AUC value of 0.846 in the validation cohort, followed by the radiomics model (0.842), and the clinical model (0.640). Calibration curves and DCA confirmed its superior predictive accuracy and clinical benefit. CONCLUSIONS: The CT-based clinical-radiomics model demonstrated robust performance in differentiating benign from malignant VCFs and holds promise for guiding individualized patient management.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Basera A, Alaouna M, Duvenhage J, Bates DO, Dlamini Z, Marima R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Frontiers in oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2025.1712170'&gt;10.3389/fonc.2025.1712170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41551143/'&gt;41551143&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Serine/arginine protein kinase 1 phosphorylates serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins to regulate splice-site selection during alternative splicing. While its role in general RNA regulation is established, its contribution to the HPV-dependent transcriptome and splicing stratification in cervical cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we sought to determine how SRPK1 inhibition differentially remodels gene expression and alternative splicing in HPV+ versus HPV- cervical cancer cells. METHODS: HPV16+ SiHa and HPV- C33A cervical cancer cells were treated with the SRPK1 inhibitor, SPHINX31. RNA profiling was performed, and differentially expressed genes were defined as |log2FC| ≥ 1.5. AS events were classified by SUPPA as exon skipping (SE), intron retention (RI), mutually exclusive exons (MXE), alternative 3' splice site (A3SS), and alternative 5' splice site (A5SS). Pathway enrichment was assessed using Gene Ontology/KEGG, STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) was used to identify protein hubs. To determine computational prediction of docking, SPHINX31 was docked into SRPK1 (PDB 5MY8) using SP/XP docking and MM-GBSA rescoring. RESULTS: SRPK1 inhibition was associated with distinct responses that were HPV-related. In C33A cells, upregulated genes were enriched for translation, RNA processing, and glycosylation, with KEGG highlighting ribosome and metabolic modules. Ribosomal hubs dominated the PPI/MCODE, suggesting possible translational and metabolic adjustments. In contrast, SiHa cells exhibited transcriptomic changes consistent with reduced expression of genes linked to Hippo, Wnt, PI3K-AKT, ERK1/2 signaling, migration, angiogenesis, and growth factor cytokine networks. Targets of YAP/TAZ (e.g., CCND1, BIRC5, SNAI2, SERPINE1) and their regulators (RASSF1, CSNK1E) were suppressed. At the splicing level, SiHa cells displayed fewer total AS events but with larger effect sizes, particularly in A3SS/A5SS. C33A cells showed abundant SE (59,234 events; small median ΔPSI) and RI (1,770 events, often binary), including complete shifts in HLA-DRB1/PLIN2 (+1.00) and KLF4 (-1.00). Notable A5SS switches included LEF1 (+1.00) and CDK6 (-1.00) in C33A, and DLX1/MRPL14/THAP5 (-1.00) in SiHa. Docking computationally predicted the low-energy poses of SPHINX31 in the SRPK1 ATP pocket. While not definitive, this evidence may potentially support the transcriptomic and splicing findings. CONCLUSION: SRPK1 inhibition may remodel the cervical cancer transcriptome in an HPV-linked manner, with SiHa cells exhibiting changes consistent with suppression of oncogenic signaling, whereas C33A cells adapt through translational and metabolic reprogramming.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lei L, Wang B, Zhao L, Li J, Yan X, Jiang J, Wang L, Ren G, Li Y, Cheng X, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.54152'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.54152&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41543854/'&gt;41543854&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Berberine is a potential therapy for metabolic disorders, yet its effects on visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver fat remain uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of berberine in reducing VAT area and liver fat content in diabetes-free individuals with obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter, double-blind randomized clinical trial, diabetes-free individuals with obesity and MASLD were enrolled at 11 hospitals in China between July 6 and December 29, 2023, with a follow-up duration of 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to receive either oral berberine, 1 g/d, or a matching placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were relative percentage change in VAT area and absolute change in liver fat content assessed by computed tomography. Other outcomes included changes in parameters of glucose, lipids, and inflammation. Analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: Among 337 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 41.8 [10.6] years; 221 [65.6%] male), 169 received berberine and 168 placebo. The mean (SD) medication adherence rates were 90.3% (14.7%) for berberine and 90.7% (17.4%) for placebo. No significant differences were observed between study arms for VAT area (1.4% [97.5% CI, -2.4% to 5.2%]) or liver fat content (0.9% [97.5% CI, -0.4% to 2.1%). Berberine was associated with larger reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-7.72 [95% CI, -13.13 to -1.93] mg/dL), apolipoprotein B (-3.42 [95% CI, -6.33 to -0.51] mg/dL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (-0.072 [95% CI, -0.140 to -0.004] mg/dL) vs placebo, but not other secondary outcomes. The incidence of adverse events was similar between study arms. Post hoc analyses suggested consistent patterns of larger reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and hs-CRP levels in participants with higher baseline hs-CRP levels. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of diabetes-free individuals with obesity and MASLD, a 6-month berberine treatment at a daily dose of 1 g had an excellent safety profile but did not reduce VAT area or liver fat content.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhang T, Zhou Z, Li Q, Cai X, Lin L, Peng H, Li M, Wang C, Jiang X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA network open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.54035'&gt;10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2025.54035&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41533374/'&gt;41533374&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The 2025 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) blood pressure (BP) guideline introduced new hypertension criteria. However, the association between newly defined nocturnal stage 1 hypertension (nocturnal BP 110-120/65-70 mm Hg) and kidney function progression in the population not receiving dialysis with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in China remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nocturnal stage 1 hypertension as defined by 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines in patients with CKD is associated with kidney function progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study involving patients with CKD not receiving dialysis was conducted in China at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from August 2010 to December 2017 and at the Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from November 2017 to December 2024. EXPOSURE: Participants were categorized into 3 groups based on nocturnal BP measurements according to the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines: nonhypertension (nocturnal BP &lt;110/65 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (nocturnal BP 110-120/65-70 mm Hg), and stage 2 hypertension (nocturnal BP ≥120/70 mm Hg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was a composite of kidney failure requiring replacement therapy (KFRT) and worsening kidney function (WKF). Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. Cox regression models were employed to assess the association between nocturnal stage 1 hypertension and outcomes. RESULTS: Among 2418 participants with CKD stage 1 through 4 not receiving dialysis included in the study, 1412 (58.4%) were men, the mean (SD) age was 45.4 (14.4) years, 436 (18.0%) had nocturnal nonhypertension, 345 (14.3%) had nocturnal stage 1 hypertension, and 1637 (67.7%) had nocturnal stage 2 hypertension. Over a median (IQR) follow-up of 3.9 (1.5-4.7) years, 394 composite kidney outcomes, 203 cases of KFRT, and 235 instances of WKF were recorded. After adjusting for confounders, nocturnal stage 1 hypertension (compared with nocturnal nonhypertension) was independently associated with an increased risk of KFRT (hazard ratio [HR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.17-4.82), WKF (HR, 3.79; 95% CI, 1.04-13.84), and the composite kidney outcome (HR, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.31-4.72). In the older population (aged ≥65 years), nocturnal BP less than 110/65 mm Hg was associated with a higher risk of WKF and the composite kidney outcome compared with nocturnal BP in the range of 110/65 to 120/70 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study of adults with CKD not receiving dialysis, nocturnal stage 1 hypertension as defined by the 2025 ACC/AHA guidelines was independently associated with an increased risk of CKD progression.</description>

The present article describes organization of the pilot, evaluation of the program using key performance indicators (KPIs), and lessons learned. METHODS: Women age 30-55 years were invited for HPV screening via a communication campaign at 11 polyclinics in Karakalpakstan province. Samples were collected and analyzed locally in nine polyclinics using GeneXpert test. HPV-positive women were triaged with colposcopy, although colposcopists were not trained to obtain biopsies or perform treatment. Abnormal results led to further diagnostic colposcopy and treatment. Pilot data were managed using an Excel database, with quality assurance through regular monitoring visits and estimation of KPIs. RESULTS: Over 10 months, 50,000 women were tested for HPV, with 98% yielding satisfactory results and a 6.8% positivity rate. Of the HPV-positive women, 93.9% underwent triaging colposcopy, revealing abnormalities in 32.5%, although results varied by district. Diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology data were available for 87.9% of referrals. Treatment adherence was not systematically tracked. An external review showed 64.6% agreement with local histopathology, and the correlation between diagnostic colposcopy and histopathology was 53.2%. CONCLUSION: The pilot successfully recruited a large number of women and ensured high participation of the HPV-positive women in triage and diagnostic evaluation. Key strengths were the use of existing health infrastructure, and decentralization of services. However, challenges were identified in HPV test procurement, referral pathways, quality of pathology and colposcopy, and adequate data collection. Addressing these issues is critical to the future success of cervical cancer screening in Uzbekistan.</description>

Nigeria had Africa's second-highest number of new cancers in 2022. This study estimated the proportion of new cancers attributable to alcohol, tobacco, and human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in Edo State, Nigeria. METHODS: We analyzed cancer incidence data from the Edo-Benin Cancer Registry (EBCR; 2009-2018) for cancer sites associated with alcohol consumption, tobacco use, and HPV infection, as outlined in the International Agency for Research on Cancer Monographs. For each site, we calculated the number of attributable cancers and the population attributable fraction for the three exposures by sex, using country-specific exposure prevalence and relative risk estimates from previous research. RESULTS: Between 2009 and 2018, the EBCR reported 4,937 cancer cases (2,069 men [41.9%] and 2,868 women [58.1%]). Nine alcohol-associated sites accounted for 30.1% of all cases (12.3% in men and 43% in women), 13 tobacco-related sites accounted for 27.5% (18.4% in men and 34.1% in women), and six HPV-related sites accounted for 15.2% (4% in men and 34.1% in women). Of alcohol-associated cancers (n = 1,488), 25.6% (381/1,488) were attributable to alcohol use; 5.3% (72/1,359) of smoking-related cancers were attributable to tobacco use, and high-risk HPV genotypes were estimated to cause 77.5% (581/750) of HPV-related cancers. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that nearly three fourths of HPV- and about one fourth of alcohol-associated cancers could be prevented through targeted and evidence-based interventions in Edo State, Nigeria. These findings highlight the need for strengthening both individual and policy-level prevention efforts, prioritizing high-impact risk factors to achieve measurable reductions in cancer burden.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: CBCT images from 287 patients were retrospectively reviewed. STCOs were identified in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes, with segmentation performed in the axial plane. The AI model was trained to detect arterial calcifications, phleboliths, tonsilloliths, styloid ligament ossification, osteoma cutis, antroliths, laryngeal cartilage calcifications, sialoliths, lymph node calcifications, and rhinoliths as well as a single combined class. Data were split into training (80%), testing (10%), and validation (10%) sets, and performance was evaluated using sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. RESULTS: In the single-class model, sensitivity, precision, and F1-score were 0.98, 0.91, and 0.94, respectively. In the multi-class model, these values were 0.88, 0.80, and 0.84. CONCLUSION: The AI system achieved high accuracy in detecting STCOs, with superior results in single-class classification. AI-assisted CBCT evaluation may improve diagnostic efficiency, facilitate multidisciplinary collaboration, and support clinical decision-making.</description>

The aim of this study was to evaluate the oral mucosa state by defining the occurrence of oral lesions and Candida carriage in DH patients. DESIGN: Thirty DH patients underwent oral mucosa examination and mycologic evaluation. RESULTS: The most common complaints included gum bleeding and pain (10 patients, 33.3%), pain due to oral ulceration (8 patients, 26.6%), a burning sensation and taste disturbances (5 patients, 16.6%), and xerostomia (4 patients, 13.3% each). The most common findings on the oral mucosa included white-coated tongue (16 persons; 53.3%) and buccal mucosa edema (15 patients; 23.3%). Linea alba was observed in 11 persons (30%). Tongue depapillation and atrophic-erythematous tongue lesions were revealed in 5 (16.6%) and 4 persons (13.3%), respectively. Candidiasis was found in 12 DH patients (40%). Systemic conditions that most commonly accompanied DH included anemia- 14 patients (46.6%), hypertension- 7 patients (23.3%), allergies- 6 patients (20%), and other gastrointestinal diseases unrelated to DH- 5 patients (16.6%). CONCLUSIONS: DH may promote the occurrence of a white-coated tongue, mucosal edema, linea alba, and atrophic glossitis, and may increase the risk of oral candidiasis.</description>

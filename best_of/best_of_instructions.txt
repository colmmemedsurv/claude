Score this paper from 0-100 based on its potential impact on the field. Consider:

HIGH IMPACT INDICATORS (score 80-100):
- Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), especially phase 3 trials
- Large prospective studies (n>500)
- Practice-changing findings or paradigm shifts
- Novel therapeutics showing significant clinical benefit
- Publications in top-tier journals (NEJM, Lancet family, JAMA family, JCO family, Annals of Oncology)
- Definitive evidence that will influence treatment guidelines
- Major survival or quality-of-life improvements
- First-in-class therapies or breakthrough mechanisms

MODERATE IMPACT (score 60-79):
- Large retrospective analyses (n>1000) with novel insights
- Phase 2 trials with promising results
- Important biomarker discoveries with clinical implications
- Meta-analyses or systematic reviews synthesizing critical data
- Publications in high-impact specialty journals (JCO, Ann Oncol, Lancet Oncol)
- Significant advances in understanding disease biology
- Real-world evidence studies showing clinically relevant patterns
- Important epidemiological findings

LOWER PRIORITY (score 40-59):
- Smaller studies (n<200) unless exceptionally novel
- Pre-clinical or translational research without immediate clinical application
- Incremental advances in established areas
- Validation studies or confirmatory analyses
- Case series or single-institution experiences
- Technical/methodological papers
- Secondary analyses of known datasets

MINIMAL IMPACT (score 0-39):
- Very small studies or case reports
- Purely mechanistic studies without therapeutic implications
- Review articles without novel synthesis
- Methodology papers without broad applicability
- Pilot studies with unclear significance

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Prioritize studies with clear clinical applicability
- Value large sample sizes and robust methodology
- Consider generalizability (multi-center > single-center)
- Favor findings that address unmet clinical needs
- Weight prospective designs higher than retrospective
- Consider potential to change practice patterns
- Recognize rare tumor studies may have smaller N but high importance
- Value health disparities and population health impact
- Generally favor studies relating to systemic treatment

When uncertain, favor studies that:
1. Address important clinical questions
2. Use rigorous methodology
3. Have adequate sample size
4. Present novel or surprising findings
5. Come from respected institutions/journals

Be discerning but fair. Not everything in top journals is practice-changing, and important findings can come from unexpected places.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial comparing hypofractionated and normofractionated radiation therapy in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, which has the potential to change treatment paradigms and improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bentzen SM, Gupta T, Jacinto AA, Rosenblatt E, Bhasker S, Napoles M, Binia S, Chansilpa Y, Aguiar S, Nagarajan M, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.056'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.056&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41711624/'&gt;41711624&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Based on bioeffect modeling of published outcomes after radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma with various time-dose-fractionation, we hypothesized that a 20-fraction hypofractionated (HFX) schedule delivering 55 Gy in 20 fractions, 5 fractions per week, over 4 weeks would be noninferior to a 33-fraction accelerated, normofractionated (NFX) 2 Gy per fraction schedule, delivering 66 Gy in 2-Gy fractions, 6 fractions per week over 5.5 weeks with respect to both local tumor control and late adverse events. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The HYPNO (HYPo-fractionated vs NOrmo-fractionated radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma) trial was designed as a multicenter, pragmatic, embedded, 2-arm, unblinded, randomized controlled noninferiority trial with dual primary endpoints, loco-regional tumor control, and grade 3 or higher late adverse events with a 10% noninferiority margin for both endpoints. The trial was open for enrollment in 12 centers, each adhering to their standard of care to the extent that it was consistent with the requirements of the trial protocol. Concurrent chemoradiation therapy with 35 mg/m2 cisplatin weekly was permitted. RESULTS: Between March 2014 and February 2020, 792 patients were centrally randomized: 395 to HFX and 397 to NFX. Accrual closed, with all outcome data still blinded, with 792 of a planned 836 patients (94.7%) enrolled, in part due to the emerging COVID-19 pandemic. The HYPNO test arm passed the separate noninferiority tests for both loco-regional tumor control (P = .04) and grade 3+ late adverse events (P = .004). At 3 years, the absolute difference in outcome between the 2 arms was ≤1.4 percentage points for overall survival, progression-free survival, loco-regional control, and grade 3+ late adverse events. The planned subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant heterogeneity of effect estimates for loco-regional control between the 2 trial arms. CONCLUSIONS: The HYPNO test arm schedule was shown to be noninferior with respect to both loco-regional tumor control and grade 3+ late adverse events.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter study validates an AI diagnostic model for laryngeal lesions using a large dataset, which could have significant clinical implications for risk stratification, although it is a retrospective analysis and not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sampieri C, Mora F, Peretti G, Larrosa M, Vilaseca I, Avilés-Jurado FX, Ioppi A, Bellini E, Alegre B, Ruiz-Sevilla L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70153'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70153&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41696998/'&gt;41696998&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To develop and externally validate a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) model using artificial intelligence (AI) for classifying laryngeal lesions from laryngoscopy images into high-risk (HR), low-risk (LR). STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter development of a CADx model and external validation on independent cohorts. SETTING: Multicenter tertiary referral hospitals (Italy, India, China, Greece, and Spain). METHODS: Over 20,000 images derived from laryngoscopic examinations were retrieved. Images were annotated based on histopathology or expert consensus. A deep learning model was trained using an internal dataset and evaluated on 2 external datasets to assess generalizability. The CADx model classifies only images containing visible lesions, discriminating between LR and HR categories. Diagnostic performance was measured using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model performance was compared with physicians of varying expertise and ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The computer-aided diagnosis model achieved a similar performance across internal and external datasets in distinguishing HR from LR lesions, with accuracy/AUC of 0.90/0.89 internally, 0.85/0.85 on the Greek dataset, and 0.88/0.88 on the Spanish dataset. The model's accuracy was statistically noninferior to that of otolaryngologists and expert laryngologists, and superior to general practitioners and ChatGPT-4o. CONCLUSION: This is a large multicenter clinical validation of a CADx model for laryngeal endoscopy, demonstrating generalizability and performance comparable to clinicians in discriminating between LR and HR lesions. The model's success supports its potential role in augmenting diagnostic capabilities, especially in resource-limited settings. A prospective multicenter clinical trial is underway to assess real-world clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study investigates a novel immunotherapy approach in a relevant animal model for HPV-negative HNSCC, presenting promising findings that could influence future clinical applications, but lacks a large sample size or direct clinical trial data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Monther A, Al-Msari R, Saddawi-Konefka R, Fassardi S, Tang C, Philips C, Sen P, Mohammadzadeh P, Decker K, Miyauchi S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328031'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0328031&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701713/'&gt;41701713&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options for patients with locally advanced disease. CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used to block the CD47/SIRPa interaction that inhibits antigen-presenting cell phagocytosis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells, and have shown promise in combination with anti-PD1 immunotherapy in tumors, including recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We found that CD47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and explored the anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD47 fusion protein in combination with anti-PD1 and lymphatic-sparing radiotherapy in a locally advanced HNSCC model. In the 4MOSC1 syngeneic HPV-negative HNSCC mouse model, ALX301 (an engineered CD47-blocking SIRPα fusion for murine models) induced complete tumor regression when combined with anti-PD-1, and produced a partial tumor response as a monotherapy. An anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in a CD47-null tumor background led to complete tumor regression confirming a key role for CD47 in tumor immunity. ALX301 treated mice demonstrated increased MHC-II expression on dendritic cells within the tumor and upregulation of CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on dendritic cells within the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes, and contralateral lymph nodes. Combination ALX301 and anti-PD1 treatment in an anti-PD1 resistant 4MOSC2 model demonstrated significant tumor regression, enhanced survivability, improved response with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and greater retention of CD8 + T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, T-cell receptor sequencing revealed increased shared clonality between the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes of ALX301 treated mice. These data demonstrate that a combination of CD47 blockade and anti-PD1 therapy enhances tumor antigen presentation and immune cell infiltration, while further improving anti-tumor responses in combination with tumor-targeted radiotherapy. This study provides support for the rational design of combinatorial immunoradiotherapy, using anti-CD47 inhibitors and anti-PD1 therapy, in a clinical trial targeting locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large retrospective analysis of 351 patients from the SEER database, providing important insights into the management and outcomes of a rare tumor, which may have clinical implications despite not being a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bhalerao RV, Huppert Steed A, Kelbert J, Hintze JM, Lott DG, Jategaonkar AA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70442'&gt;10.1002/lary.70442&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41685670/'&gt;41685670&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVES: Laryngeal chondrosarcoma (LC) is a rare tumor accounting for less than 1% of all laryngeal cancers. While surgery is the primary treatment, national trends in management and outcomes remain poorly defined. This study aimed to analyze incidence, survival, and treatment strategies for LC using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: Patients with LC diagnosed between 2000 and 2021 were identified from SEER. Demographic, treatment, and survival data were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression were used to analyze survival outcomes. RESULTS: In total, 351 patients with LC were identified, representing 0.3% of all laryngeal malignancies. Among patients with treatment data, 53.3% underwent local excision or partial laryngectomy, 27.5% underwent total laryngectomy (TL), and 19.2% received no surgery. Ten-year disease-specific survival was 84.8%. Patients undergoing partial resection demonstrated significantly improved survival compared with TL (p &lt; 0.05), although this finding is likely confounded by tumor size and stage. On multivariate analysis, advanced stage (HR 2.59, 95% CI 1.68-3.97), older age (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.36-1.99), and TL (HR 2.95, 95% CI 1.88-4.62) were associated with worse survival. CONCLUSION: LC remains rare but carries favorable long-term survival. National trends demonstrate a shift toward organ-preserving surgery, with partial resections increasingly favored over TL. Prognosis is most strongly influenced by age and stage, while radiation therapy appears to play a little role. These findings support organ preservation in appropriately selected patients and highlight the need for prospective studies integrating oncologic and functional outcomes.</description>

A total of 263 dentists from public and private institutions in Ankara, Türkiye, participated in the survey, which included a content-validated 36-item questionnaire covering demographic data, examination habits, knowledge of lesion features, biopsy practices, and educational experience. The data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations to explore associations between professional characteristics and clinical behaviors. While 78% of the participants acknowledged the dentist's role in reducing oral cancer mortality, only 17.5% reported performing routine oral cancer screenings. Biopsy practice was limited, with only 11% indicating that they had ever performed a biopsy, and 36.9% preferred to monitor lesions instead of referring them immediately. Experienced dentists were significantly more likely to examine their lymph nodes (p = 0.006) and conduct routine screenings (p &lt; 0.001). Although tobacco and alcohol use are widely recognized as risk factors, only 27.7% of the participants routinely examined high-risk anatomical areas. Patient education was reported by 92.4% of the participants, but brochures and visual aids were rarely used. Fewer than one-third of the participants rated their undergraduate training on oral cancer as sufficient, and most supported mandatory continuing education. The findings reveal considerable gaps in dentists' preparedness and implementation of early detection strategies despite high awareness levels. Strengthening diagnostic education in undergraduate programs and promoting structured continuing education may improve early detection efforts and reduce oral cancer-related morbidity and mortality.</description>

Prophylactic supplementation with calcium and calcitriol (C+C) is widely used, but selective administration based on early postoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels may reduce overtreatment. OBJECTIVE: To compare the incidence of symptomatic and biochemical hypocalcemia with routine prophylactic C+C and selective supplementation guided by postoperative PTH levels. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a multicenter, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial conducted from June 1, 2022, to July 31, 2024, at 3 tertiary hospitals with adult patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for benign or malignant disease. Exclusion criteria included prior parathyroid surgery and calcium metabolism disorders. Data were analyzed from October 1, 2024, to March 30, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Selective supplementation when 4-hour postoperative PTH level was less than 15 pg/mL (PTH group; to convert to ng/L, multiply by 1) or routine prophylactic C+C for 15 days (C+C group). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Symptomatic hypocalcemia at 15 days postoperatively, assessed via a symptom scale. Secondary outcomes included biochemical hypocalcemia adverse events, calcium supplementation, and readmissions. RESULTS: The analysis included a total of 258 participants; the PTH group comprised 117 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.3 [15.2] years; 100 women [85.5%]) and the C+C group, 141 patients (mean [SD] age, 49.8 [15.9] years; 118 women [83.7%]). Bethesda III to VI nodules were present in 57 (48.7%) and 62 patients (44.0%), respectively. Symptomatic hypocalcemia occurred in 24 patients overall (9.3%), 11 (7.8%) in PTH group and 13 (11.1%) in C+C group (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.29-1.57; P = .36). In the subgroup with complete biochemical data, biochemical hypocalcemia was observed in 29 of 148 participants (16 in PTH [21.6%] and 13 in C+C [17.6%]) (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.57-2.93; P = .53). Adverse events and complications were similar across groups. The PTH group needed less calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that selective calcium supplementation based on postoperative PTH values was not superior to routine calcium supplementation for preventing symptomatic or biochemical hypocalcemia after total thyroidectomy. Either strategy may be used, with choice depending on resource availability and clinical setting. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05252884.</description>

The prescribing patterns are largely unreported, and assessment of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) in patients with HNC is limited. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prescribing patterns of immunotherapy and the incidence and risk factors for irAEs using a claims-based database. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study of MarketScan Commercial and multistate Medicaid databases of all patients with HNC from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2022, was performed. Inclusion criteria were patients with HNC, defined by International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) codes with 6 months or longer of insurance enrollment prior to diagnosis and 1 or more months of follow-up. The databases excluded patients 65 years or older. Statistical analysis was conducted from October 1, 2024, through December 31, 2024. EXPOSURE: Prescription of an immunotherapeutic within 12 months after HNC diagnosis. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome measure was prescribing rate of immunotherapeutics overall and per year. The relative use of each immunotherapeutic was also explored. Secondary outcome measures were incidence of irAEs, severe irAEs, and univariable/multivariate risk factors for irAEs. RESULTS: A total of 47 365 patients with HNC were included, and 2254 (4.8%) of these patients received immunotherapy. Overall, 32 195 participants were male individuals (68%) and 14 607 were female individuals (32%), with a mean (SD) age of 54 (9) years. The rate of immunotherapy prescriptions slightly increased over time from 2.3% of patients with HNC in 2017 to 2.8% in 2022 (percent change, 0.5%; 95% CI, 0.1%-0.9%). Following initial approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), prescribing patterns of pembrolizumab and nivolumab were similar, but divergence in 2019 led to 87% of the market share dominated by pembrolizumab by 2022. The 90-day overall irAE-rate was 41.2% and severe irAE rate was 2.7%. There was no association between medication use and irAEs. Comorbidity score was associated with severe irAEs at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03). Baseline hypothyroidism (adjusted OR [aOR], 6.7; 95% CI, 5.0-9.0) and liver disease (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.1-2.7) were independently associated with the development of irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: This cohort study found that pembrolizumab dominated the immunotherapy prescribing market, but the relative use of immunotherapy has minimally increased in patients younger than 65 years since FDA approval. irAEs were frequent and associated with key individual comorbidities. Severe irAEs were rare and associated with overall comorbidity status.</description>

This study evaluated the risk of long-term morbidities in thyroid cancer patients who developed permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism (PO-hypoPT), compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using South Korea's nationwide claims data encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Among 217,156 thyroid cancer patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 2013 to 2020, 15,592 patients with PO-hypoPT and 27,906 matched controls with preserved parathyroid function were identified after 1:2 propensity score (PS) matching. Long-term morbidities associated with hypoPT included nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression. Hazard ratios (HRs) for these morbidities were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after large-scale PS matching. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration in both groups was approximately 5 years. Patients with PO-hypoPT had a significantly higher risk of nephrolithiasis (HR 1.17, confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.30), renal insufficiency (HR 1.75, [CI 1.50-2.03]), and MACE (HR 1.10, [CI 1.01-1.19]) compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. However, the risks of other long-term morbidities, including seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression, were not significantly different between the two groups. The association between PO-hypoPT and renal insufficiency remained consistent across all subgroups stratified by sex, age, and duration of calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: PO-hypoPT in thyroid cancer patients is associated with increased long-term morbidity, particularly renal and cardiovascular complications. Long-term monitoring of renal function and cardiovascular health is warranted in this population.</description>

DNA methylation, a proven molecular biomarker for cancer classification, holds promise for stratifying thyroid cancer risk. The objectives were to determine the epigenetic hallmarks of pediatric thyroid carcinomas and to investigate whether DNA methylome profiling is a feasible approach for pre-operative risk stratification of this pediatric disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from two separately processed cohorts of pediatric thyroid carcinoma. The reference cohort included 100 samples, consisting of 87 well-differentiated primary tumors-77 papillary and 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas-and 13 matched lymph node metastases. To predict oncogenic drivers and tumor invasiveness, defined by the presence of nodal metastasis, we trained two classifiers on the reference cohort and then evaluated their performance on a second validation cohort of 84 samples, including 83 primary tumors and one lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We identified distinct methylation patterns associated with tumor invasiveness and key driver mutations, including BRAF p.V600E, RAS-like mutations, kinase fusions, and DICER1 mutations. The differentially methylated regions reflect inflammatory stress, disrupted thyroid development and function, implicating AR, Hippo, and AP-1 signaling. Leveraging these epigenetic signatures, we developed and validated two methylation-based classifiers that accurately predict tumor invasiveness and oncogenic mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric thyroid carcinoma patients, DNA methylation assays accurately predict tumor invasiveness and driver mutations. Our findings highlight the clinical value of DNA methylation profiling for risk stratification and classification of pediatric thyroid cancers.</description>

In this study, we addressed the effects of areca nut extract (ANE) on oral carcinogenesis by modulating fibroblast behavior in oral tissue. METHODS: Cell viability, migration, invasion, and flow cytometry assays were applied to study cell behaviors. Cytokine array, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, phospho-kinase array, Western blot analysis, and oxygen consumption and glycolysis assays were performed to evaluate cell functions. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining using human and hamster oral tissues was applied to validate in vitro findings. RESULTS: Increased alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) were observed in fibroblasts from oral precancerous and cancer lesions. ANE increased mitochondrial metabolism in fibroblasts and induced myofibroblast transition. It enhanced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) secretion in fibroblasts. Conditioned medium from ANE-treated fibroblasts and recombinant GM-CSF increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) phosphorylation and malignant transformation in dysplastic oral keratinocytes. In hamsters, ANE treatment increased GM-CSF expression in fibroblasts and EGFR phosphorylation in epithelial cells. CONCLUSION: ANE promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and GM-CSF secretion in fibroblasts, which activate EGFR signaling and malignant transformation of oral precancerous cells.</description>

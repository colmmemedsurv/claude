      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 78/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This phase 1 trial evaluates a first-in-class therapy in combination with pembrolizumab for advanced solid tumors, addressing a critical area of immune resistance, and published in a high-impact journal, indicating moderate impact with potential clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yap TA, Sweis RF, Vaishampayan U, Kilari D, Gainor JF, McKean M, Barve M, Tarhini AA, Bockorny B, Sonpavde G, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature medicine | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w'&gt;10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41530380/'&gt;41530380&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have revolutionized oncology, many cancers are unresponsive or develop resistance that involves transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1). This multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study (DRAGON trial, SRK-181-001) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, predictive biomarkers and efficacy of linavonkibart, a first-in-class fully human selective anti-latent TGFβ1 antibody with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The DRAGON trial was divided into three treatment parts: part A1 (dose-escalation cohorts with single-agent linavonkibart), part A2 (dose-escalation cohorts with the combination treatment of linavonkibart and pembrolizumab) and part B (dose-expansion cohorts with the combination treatment). The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of linavonkibart alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives included evaluation of linavonkibart pharmacokinetics for each treatment paradigm, assessment of anti-linavonkibart antibody development (parts A and B) and measurement of antitumor activity (part B) after treatment. All primary and secondary objectives were met in the study. Overall, linavonkibart had a manageable safety profile, and combined therapy with pembrolizumab was generally consistent with that of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Dermatological reactions were the only additional risk identified. Neither cytokine release syndrome nor infusion interruption was observed in any patient enrolled in DRAGON. In part A (n = 34), no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred (linavonkibart; ≤3,000 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 2,000 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W)). In part B (n = 78), patients progressing on prior anti-PD-1 therapy received linavonkibart (1,500 mg Q3W/1,000 mg Q2W) with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W). This combination demonstrated confirmed objective response rates of 20.0%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 9.1% in anti-PD-1-resistant patients with clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), melanoma, head and neck squamous cell cancer and urothelial cancer, respectively. Biomarker data provide proof of mechanism and a potential ccRCC patient selection strategy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04291079 .</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective study with a substantial sample size of 210 patients, focusing on a clinically relevant issue in papillary thyroid cancer risk stratification using circulating tumor cells, which has potential implications for treatment decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiang L, Li X, Ma T, Zeng P, Tan Z, Zheng C, Xu J, Zhang L, Guo Y, Liang J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2694'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2694&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41543346/'&gt;41543346&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Preoperative risk stratification for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a significant clinical challenge, as current systems primarily rely on postoperative pathology, limiting their utility for initial treatment planning. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive liquid biopsy tool to stratify patient risk preoperatively. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study evaluating preoperative CTC levels in 210 patients diagnosed with PTC. A dual-threshold model was developed to analyze the diagnostic performance of CTC counts. The study particularly focused on the Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) subgroup (n=100) to address clinical uncertainty regarding active surveillance versus definitive therapy. Patients were monitored over a median follow-up period of 44 months to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and long-term prognostic outcomes. RESULTS: The dual-threshold model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff of ≥ 2 CTCs effectively identified high-risk patients with 93.2% specificity and 88.2% positive predictive value (PPV). In the PTMC cohort, a CTC count &lt; 2 reliably identified low-risk patients suitable for active surveillance (NPV=94.0%), while a count ≥ 2 pinpointed those with high-risk features warranting surgery (Specificity=96.4%, PPV=80.0%). Prognostic analysis revealed that CTC-negative patients had improved PFS. This was most significant in the PTMC subgroup, where the CTC-negative cohort remained recurrence-free and showed significantly longer PFS compared to CTC-positive cases (HR=0.035, 95% CI: 0.002-0.726; P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CTC detection enables precise risk stratification for PTC patients. This liquid biopsy approach allows clinicians to personalize therapy-confidently selecting conservative management for low-risk individuals and recommending aggressive treatment for high-risk patients-thereby optimizing clinical decision-making and long-term outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective population-based study with a focus on a high-risk group for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, providing important insights into detection methods. While it may not be practice-changing, it offers valuable data on the effectiveness of MRI compared to endoscopy, which could influence screening practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhou HN, Li T, Peng YN, Li H, Wu ZC, Fan YY, King AD, Hildesheim A, Ling W, Liu Z, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70256'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41548058/'&gt;41548058&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) detection in screening remains unclear as a result of limited follow-up. METHODS: A prospective population-based screening study was conducted in Southern China from October 2014 to November 2018 among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals aged 30-69 years. EBV-seropositive participants underwent both endoscopy and MRI. Suspicious findings from either modality triggered a second endoscopy with biopsy. Followup for cancer diagnoses was completed via multiple methods in October 2023. Primary end points included the 5-year NPC detection rate (overall and by stage) and the false-negative rate. Secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and referral rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 814 individuals (455 females; 56%) with a median age of 53 years (interquartile range, 46-60 years). Thirty-two NPC cases were detected (30 via MRI; 21 via endoscopy) over 5 years. MRI showed a significantly higher overall NPC detection rate (36.9 [95% CI, 25.9-52.1] vs. 25.8 [95% CI, 16.9-39.1] per 1000; p = .007) and early-stage tumor detection (20.9 [95% CI, 13.1-27.1] vs. 12.3 [95% CI, 6.7-22.5] per 1000; p = .020) than endoscopy. MRI also demonstrated a lower false-negative rate (3.0 [95% CI, 0.8-11.0] vs. 14.9 [95% CI, 8.4-26.5] per 1000; p = .024) and higher sensitivity (93.8% vs. 65.6%; p = .007) but lower specificity (84.0% vs. 92.8%; p &lt; .001) and PPV (19.6% vs. 27.6%; p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Single MRI demonstrated superior NPC detection versus endoscopy, particularly for early-stage tumors, in high-risk populations during a 5-year period, which suggests the potential for extending the rescreening interval to 5 years for MRI-negative individuals.</description>

Comprehensive recurrence risk stratification remains lacking. Here, we profile 482 MTC samples from 452 patients across ten Chinese clinical centers, identifying 10,092 proteins and mutations in 87.0% of patients. Clinically, MTC grading, concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma, and lymph node metastasis are significant recurrence risk factors, whereas at the genetic level, RET M918T and RET S891A mutations are correlated with high recurrence risk in sporadic and hereditary MTC, respectively. Ubiquitinomics show downregulated E3 ligases CUL4B and TRIM32 are associated with structural recurrence. We define three molecular subtypes with distinct outcomes and present an integrative machine learning model combining clinical, genomic, and proteomic features, validated in an independent test dataset of 105 patients and a published dataset. This multi-center, multi-omics study enhances the understanding of MTC heterogeneity and facilitates personalized patient management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset of nearly 47,000 cases to propose a novel staging schema that incorporates grade as a prognostic factor, which could have significant implications for treatment decisions in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ho AS, Luu M, Manzoor D, Maluf H, Bailey C, Balzer B, Walgama ES, Jang JK, Scher KC, Moyers JT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107847'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107847&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41534318/'&gt;41534318&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: While numerous cancer staging systems have incorporated grade into stage, the impact of grade on oral cavity carcinoma (OCC) prognosis has been conflicting. We investigated grade as a prognostic determinant in OCC staging. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression models of OCC patients identified via U.S. cancer registry data were constructed to determine associations between grade (G1 = low-grade, G2 = intermediate-grade, G3 = high-grade) and overall survival (OS). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to derive staging schema. RESULTS: Overall, 46,789 OCC cases were identified across 1,222 institutions. On univariate analysis, higher grade was associated with worse 5-yr OS (G1: 73% [95% CI 72-74%], G2: 61% [95 CI 60-61%], G3: 49% [95% CI 48-51%] (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors, these survival differences persisted. Compared to G1 tumors, both G2 (HR 1.25 [95% CI 1.19-1.30], p &lt; 0.001) and G3 (HR 1.52 [95% CI 1.45-1.61], p &lt; 0.001) tumors were associated with significantly worse OS. Similar results were seen when utilizing propensity score matching. RPA generated subgroups that mirrored AJCC8E, but with G3 cases performing worse for a given stage. A proposed TNM + G staging schema was created with AJCC8E G3 cases upstaged by one category. Overall, 11.5% (4,745/36,623) cases were upstaged. TNM + G performed better than AJCC8E by c-index (0.673 vs. 0.671) and Brier score (0.174 vs. 0.175). CONCLUSION: Large-scale analysis supports grade as an influential predictive determinant in OCC outcomes, with hazard on par with conventional staging factors. Incorporation of grade into stage strengthens existing AJCC OCC schema and pragmatically improves its ability to convey prognosis.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 8510 laryngoscopic images from 743 patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. A dual-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture was constructed, integrating multi-scale feature analysis with cross-attention fusion mechanisms. The model was rigorously evaluated through internal-external validation and a prospective reader study involving 12 endoscopists of varying expertise. RESULTS: The AI system demonstrated superior performance in three-tier classification, achieving F1-scores of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.869-0.896) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.844-0.878) for high-risk lesion identification in internal and external validation, respectively. AI assistance significantly improved junior endoscopists' sensitivity from 67.1% to 81.4% (P &lt; 0.001), effectively narrowing diagnostic performance disparities with senior experts. The system maintained robust generalizability across institutions, with 90.5% accuracy under heterogeneous imaging protocols. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI framework provides a clinically effective solution for reliable VCL risk stratification and reduces diagnostic variability between clinicians. Validated across multiple centers, this dual-scale ViT approach establishes a novel paradigm for laryngoscopic diagnosis and holds significant potential to standardize diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings.</description>

METHODS: County-level HNC incidence rates and sociodemographic variables were obtained from SEER. Drinking water lead concentrations were sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW). Tobacco and alcohol use data were retrieved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flexible semi-parametric regression models were used to assess the association between lead exposure and HNC incidence, adjusting for known confounders. Multiple comparisons were addressed using Holm's method, and sensitivity analyses were performed using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. RESULTS: Higher lead concentrations were significantly associated with increased incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancers (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P &lt; .01), gum and mouth cancers (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P = .02), and esophageal neoplasms (IRR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, P = .02). These associations remained significant after multiple testing correction and were consistent across OLS models. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that even low-level lead exposure below EPA limits in drinking water is associated with increased incidence of specific HNC subsites. These findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into environmental determinants of HNC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective cohort of 1870 patients, providing important insights into the prognostic significance of minimal extrathyroidal extension in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which could influence clinical practice, although it does not meet the criteria for higher impact due to its retrospective nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kang S, Bai H, Liu H, Wang Y, Hu X, Xu H, Wang A, Lyu Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70172'&gt;10.1002/hed.70172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41550062/'&gt;41550062&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has excluded minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) from the T3 category. However, mETE remains classified as an intermediate-risk feature for recurrence in thyroid cancer. The prognostic significance of mETE and its association with recurrence risk remain subjects of ongoing debate. METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1870 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) with central lymph node dissection (CLND) between 2015 and 2020. Cox proportional hazards regression models and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the association of mETE with structural recurrence. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.9 months, 124 patients (6.6%) experienced structural recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with mETE than in those without (11.0% vs. 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that mETE was an independent risk factor, particularly in patients with bilateral tumors (HR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.8-4.95) and those without Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.53-3.63). A significant interaction between tumor bilaterality and mETE was observed (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PTC, mETE is a significant prognostic factor of structural recurrence and is associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS). Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that mETE elevates recurrence risk to near the ATA intermediate-high threshold (17.6%) in bilateral PTC, regardless of tumor size. This synergy of mETE and bilaterality supports upgrading risk stratification and intensifying surveillance for this subset.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This review discusses important management strategies for the clinically N0 neck in oral squamous cell carcinoma, addressing a significant clinical dilemma, but it lacks the rigor of a large prospective study or randomized controlled trial that would have a higher impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Adachi M, Ohta S, Ishii A, Motohashi M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107839'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107839&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41554216/'&gt;41554216&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The management of the clinically negative neck (N0) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains a challenging clinical dilemma. Although imaging techniques have advanced, occult metastases are present in approximately 20-30% of patients with early-stage oral cancer and clinically negative necks. OBJECTIVE: This review examines current evidence on optimal strategies for managing the N0 neck in oral cancer patients. METHODS: We discuss diagnostic modalities for detecting occult metastases, including clinical examination, conventional imaging (ultrasonography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging), functional imaging (positron emission tomography), and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The review evaluates the main management approaches---elective neck dissection, watchful waiting, and sentinel lymph node biopsy---analyzing current evidence from randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. RESULTS: We examine patient and tumor factors that influence decision-making, including tumor thickness, location, differentiation, and pattern of invasion. Special considerations for specific subsites and clinical scenarios are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, we explore emerging technologies and future directions in the management of the N0 neck, including molecular biomarkers, liquid biopsy techniques, and personalized approaches to treatment. This review provides evidence-based recommendations to support clinical decision-making for managing patients with oral cancer and clinically negative necks.</description>

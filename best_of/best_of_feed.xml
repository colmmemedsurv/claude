      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents a secondary analysis of a phase 3 randomized clinical trial published in a high-impact journal (JAMA Oncology), demonstrating long-term survival benefits of a novel combination therapy for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which has clear implications for clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang Y, Sun D, Zhou H, Zhou T, Qu S, Li J, Hu C, Xu M, Li W, Shen L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245'&gt;10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609753/'&gt;41609753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy is the current standard first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC). However, the long-term survival benefits at the 5-year benchmark remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding camrelizumab to chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS) as first-line treatment for RM-NPC, compared with chemotherapy alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CAPTAIN-1st trial was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial conducted at 28 hospitals in China. Between November 13, 2018, and November 29, 2019, patients with treatment-naive RM-NPC were enrolled. This secondary analysis of the CAPTAIN-1st trial was prespecified. Data analysis was conducted on June 1, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive camrelizumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or completion of 2 years of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary end point, progression-free survival per independent review committee, has been reported previously. Herein, the secondary end point of OS is reported as prespecified in the protocol. RESULTS: Among 263 randomized patients (134 in randomized to camrelizumab, 129 to placebo), baseline characteristics were generally balanced between groups, except for age. The mean (SD) age was 49 (11.25) years, and 218 patients (82.9%) were male individuals, 45 (17.1%) were female individuals. With a median survival follow-up of 63.5 (95% CI, 61.2-64.6) months for the camrelizumab group and 63.0 (95% CI, 60.8-64.6) months for the placebo group, 85 (63.4%) and 95 (73.6%) deaths occurred, respectively. Median OS was 34.5 months (95% CI, 29.4-45.7) with camrelizumab vs 26.6 months (95% CI, 19.8-33.5) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; 2-sided P = .047). After adjusting for age imbalance, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P = .01). The 5-year OS rates were 37.8% vs 24.2%, reflecting an absolute difference of 13.6% (95% CI, 2.4%-24.8%; P = .02) in favor of camrelizumab. The OS benefits were generally consistent across subgroups. In the camrelizumab group, patients who achieved rapid clearance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA had significantly longer OS compared with those without EBV DNA clearance (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful 5-year OS benefits compared with chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of RM-NPC. These findings provided the first 5-year evidence supporting the benefit of PD-1-based chemoimmunotherapy in this setting.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective, single-center randomized controlled trial comparing a novel surgical technique for papillary thyroid carcinoma, which could have significant implications for surgical practice, although the sample size is moderate and the study is not published in a top-tier journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wu K, Wei X, Lu M, Wei X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70187'&gt;10.1002/hed.70187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41612971/'&gt;41612971&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and surgical efficacy of endoscopic thyroidectomy by gasless unilateral axillary (ETGUA) with conventional open thyroidectomy in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: This prospective, single-center, and randomized controlled trial included 196 patients with PTC who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ETGUA group (n = 98) or the open thyroidectomy group (n = 98). Complications within 30 days, parathyroid function [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium], and short-term oncological outcomes were observed. Secondary outcomes included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative recovery, pain score, cosmetic satisfaction, and hospitalization cost. RESULTS: The ETGUA group had a significantly longer operative time than the open thyroidectomy group, less intraoperative blood loss, more postoperative drainage at postoperative day 1, as well as a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all p &lt; 0.05). At 1 year postoperatively, surgical efficacy and oncological indicators such as the number of lymph nodes dissected, number of positive lymph nodes, stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) level, and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy were comparable between groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ETGUA group reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and higher cosmetic satisfaction, though the total hospitalization cost was slightly higher (all p &lt; 0.05). The learning curve analysis indicated that operative time and intraoperative blood loss stabilized after approximately 30-40 cases. CONCLUSION: ETGUA demonstrates comparable safety and oncological efficacy to conventional open thyroidectomy in PTC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a phase II trial evaluating a novel combination therapy in a specific patient population with anti-PD-1 resistance, providing important insights into treatment options for a challenging subset of head and neck cancer patients, although it lacks the large sample size and definitive evidence typically associated with higher impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ju H, Wu Y, Shi C, Xia R, Song H, Ma X, Liu Y, Sun L, Zhu L, Chen L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68736-2'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-68736-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41605945/'&gt;41605945&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterised by hyperactivation of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) pathway. As immunotherapy has become the first-line treatment for HNSCC, resistance to anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents has emerged as a pivotal challenge. This prospective, single arm, phase II study (NCT05721443) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, combined with cetuximab in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Patients diagnosed with p16-negative R/M HNSCC resistant to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy without prior cetuximab treatment were enroled. Patients received oral dalpiciclib (150 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) and intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly in each cycle). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. Between March 2023 and November 2024, a total of 28 patients were enroled. The ORR was 67.9% (19/28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49.0%-82.0%), which met our primary endpoint. With a median follow-up of 9.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.98-14.12), the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.13- not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 10.75-23.25). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in all patients, predominantly grade 1-2. Grade 3 TRAEs included neutrophil count decreased (9/28, 32.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (9/28, 32.1%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. Dalpiciclib combined with cetuximab was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter, multinational study utilizes a novel artificial intelligence model to predict recurrence and survival in head and neck cancer, addressing a significant clinical need with potential implications for treatment strategies, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jung HA, Merkin R, Feng AL, Lee D, Lee K, Park S, Sun JM, Lee SH, Ahn JS, Ahn MJ, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; ESMO open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.106046'&gt;10.1016/j.esmoop.2025.106046&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-27&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41604818/'&gt;41604818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for ∼5.3% of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with an estimated 890 000 new diagnoses and 450 000 deaths annually. Despite curative-intent therapy, 10% to 50% of patients experience recurrence. Prognosis for recurrent or metastatic disease is poor, with limited treatment options, underscoring the need for accurate prognostic models to guide treatment escalation or de-escalation and avoid over-treatment. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prognostic study of patients undergoing curative-intent surgery at Samsung Medical Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary/Massachusetts General Hospital from 2008 to 2024. Baseline clinicopathologic variables were integrated with longitudinal laboratory measurements from surveillance. A random 80/20 split defined development and internal-validation cohorts. Using XGBoost, we trained two models to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from each visit. RESULTS: A total of 975 patients with HNSCC (oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal subsites) were included. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year RFS from the surveillance time point were 0.785 (sensitivity, 72.8%; specificity, 71.5%), 0.831 (79.7%; 73.7%), 0.788 (74.0%; 73.3%), 0.769 (72.6%; 70.5%), and 0.795 (72.1%; 74.7%), respectively. For OS prediction, AUCs were 0.788 (72.1%; 73.6%), 0.797 (75.7%; 71.8%), 0.796 (81.0%; 68.4%), 0.820 (77.5%; 76.5%), and 0.815 (75.8%; 75.8%), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the model showed strong OS prediction in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, with AUCs of 0.943, 0.736, 0.699, 0.835, and 0.765 at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years, respectively. In non-HPV-positive HNSCC, OS AUCs ranged from 0.780 to 0.813 and RFS AUCs from 0.774 to 0.830 across the same time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model using multimodal and longitudinal data accurately predicted RFS and OS at multiple time points following curative-intent surgery for HNSCC.</description>

This study aims to explore the optimal extent of LND and discover a personalized and accurate surgical plan for pN1 PTC patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 550 patients with PTC who underwent initial surgery. For patients who were considered pN1a, LND of levels III and IV was completed. For patients who were considered LNM in levels III or IV, after taking 3-6 lymph nodes of level III for frozen pathological examination, if LNM was found, LND of levels II-IV was performed; otherwise, only levels III and IV were dissected, For patients who were considered to have LNM in level II, LND of levels II-V was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: 51.4% of patients with pN1a had postoperative pathologically confirmed occult LNM in levels III and IV. Among patients who underwent LND of levels II-IV due to positive lymph nodes in level III, 46.1% had occult LNM in level II. For patients with LNM in level II, the incidence of occult metastasis in level V was 20%. Only one patient presented with lymph node recurrence outside of the operative field. The proportion of patients with postoperative complications increased as the scope of dissection enlarged. CONCLUSION: Combined with the distribution of LNM and the number of subregions of LNM(n) in preoperative ultrasonography, it is suggested that the range of LND in the lateral neck of pN1 PTC should be n + 1/2 anatomical subregions.</description>

Evidence suggests that LN colonization induces systemic immunosuppression, facilitating distant metastasis. We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-γ signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.</description>

We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter, phase IIa trial evaluates a novel anti-EGFR antibody-drug conjugate in a challenging patient population with limited options, providing promising insights into treatment efficacy, though it lacks the definitive evidence and larger sample size typically associated with higher impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xue L, Han Y, Zhang Q, Li X, Fang M, Zhong L, Wang S, Liu Y, Zhang S, Li Z, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3930'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3930&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41603720/'&gt;41603720&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: This multicenter, phase IIa trial (NCT04868162) investigated the efficacy and safety of becotatug vedotin, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody-drug conjugate, in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) who have limited therapeutic options. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter study with 500 patients presents a novel MRI-based fusion model for predicting radiation-induced carotid artery injury, which has important clinical implications for patient management after radiotherapy, although it is a retrospective analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhang H, Ding J, Zhang L, Li J, Ding M, Li L, Hou X, Chen W, Sun K, Cao N, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111390'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111390&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-24&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41587618/'&gt;41587618&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: To develop and validate an MRI-based fusion model (Rad-SRad-SwinT) integrating conventional radiomics (Rad), subregional radiomics (SRad), and Transformer-derived deep learning features (Swin Transformer, SwinT) to predict post-radiotherapy radiation-induced carotid artery injury (RICAI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 500 NPC patients from four hospitals were allocated to training (n = 274), internal testing (n = 118), and external testing cohorts (n = 108). Rad features were extracted from MRI-defined carotid artery regions of interest, SRad features from K-means-derived subregions, and deep features from a SwinT backbone. Single-source and fusion models were developed. Discrimination (AUC), classification (ACC/SEN/SPE), calibration (Brier score and calibration curves), reclassification (NRI/IDI), and interpretability (SHAP) were assessed. RESULTS: RICAI was observed in 48.5%, 48.3%, and 54.6% of the training, internal testing, and external testing cohorts, respectively. Among single-source models, SwinT and SRad showed comparable performance, with Rad slightly inferior; all outperformed the clinical model. The fused Rad-SRad-SwinT achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.737-0.891) in internal testing and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.794-0.932) in external testing, alongside favorable classification in external testing (ACC 0.815, SEN 0.763, SPE 0.878) and good calibration (Brier score 0.148). NRI/IDI analyses indicated significantly improved reclassification versus single-source models. SHAP analyses demonstrated that SwinT-derived features contributed most to model decisions, followed by SRad and Rad, supporting complementary gains from deep semantic representation and subregional heterogeneity quantification. CONCLUSION: Integrating multilevel radiomics with Transformer-derived deep learning features enhances prediction of RICAI after NPC radiotherapy and shows promise as a noninvasive risk-stratification tool.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This randomized controlled trial evaluates the impact of a virtual 3D model on patient communication in thyroid surgery, providing important insights into preoperative counseling, although the sample size is relatively small and the findings may not directly change clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao Z, Zhang Q, Yan S, Qian Z, Xu X, Liu Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers18020241'&gt;10.3390/cancers18020241&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41595161/'&gt;41595161&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Effective preoperative patient counseling is essential to shared decision-making. In thyroid surgery, patient communication can be complicated by the complex anatomy and variable surgical approaches, which may not be fully conveyed through conventional verbal explanations or schematic drawings. Virtual three-dimensional (3D) thyroid models may provide an intuitive tool to enhance patient comprehension. METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial at Peking Union Medical College Hospital with 94 newly-diagnosed thyroid cancer patients scheduled for thyroidectomy. Participants were assigned to either the control group (n = 47), which received preoperative drawing-based counseling, or the intervention group (n = 47), which utilized a virtual 3D model for communication. The Thyroid Navigator app, developed by Kuma Hospital, was used to provide dynamic 3D representation of the thyroid gland, surrounding structures, and potential surgical procedures. After standardized preoperative consultations, patients were surveyed to assess their understanding in pertinent anatomy and postoperative complications. RESULTS: Patients in the 3D model group demonstrated similar correct response rates in lesion localization (p = 0.536) or parathyroid gland recognition (p = 0.071), but significantly higher accuracy in identifying the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the extent of lymph node dissection compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, comprehension of the causes of major postoperative complications-including hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, p = 0.004), hypocalcemia (parathyroid gland impairment, p = 0.015), and bleeding (inadequate hemostasis, p = 0.008)-was significantly improved in the 3D model group. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a virtual 3D thyroid model significantly improves patient comprehension of thyroid anatomy, surgical procedures, and potential complications, thereby enhancing clinician-patient communication. Virtual 3D models represent a practical and cost-effective supplement to conventional counseling in thyroid surgery, offering clear benefits in patient education and shared decision-making.</description>

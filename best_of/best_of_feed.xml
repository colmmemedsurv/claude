      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 82/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study reports long-term outcomes from a phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating a de-escalation strategy in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, addressing an important clinical question with potential practice-changing implications for treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lovett JT, Wotman MT, Westra WH, Ahn S, Gupta V, Bakst RL, Roof S, Miles BA, Genden E, Misiukiewicz K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564691/'&gt;41564691&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The rising incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) underscores the need for treatment strategies that maintain disease control while minimizing long-term toxicity. This study reports the long-term follow-up of de-escalation in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, providing critical data for future studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced HPV-OPC treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by reduced-dose chemoradiation (rdCRT). We hypothesized that de-escalated radiation therapy after IC would be non-inferior to standard-dose CRT (sdCRT). DESIGN: Two sequential clinical trials; Quarterback (QB) 1: phase III randomized control trial, QB 2: phase II non-randomized trial; patient accrual conducted between December 2012 and February 2022; final data cutoff April 2025. Median follow-up (IQR): 88.5 (64.6-118.2) months. SETTING: Single-institution academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients with HPV-OPC were screened. 47 patients received rdCRT after IC and were included in the primary analysis. Key eligibility: smoking history ≤20 pack-years, no active smoking, no distant metastases, molecularly confirmed HPV status. INTERVENTIONS: Three cycles of induction TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) followed by rdCRT (5600 cGy) with weekly carboplatin in clinical responders; non-responders in both QB trials and responders in the control arm of QB1 received sdCRT (7000 cGy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoints: 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary: overall survival (OS). Tertiary: disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Among 47 patients treated with rdCRT after IC, the 3-year and 5-year LRRFS were 89.3% and 86.6%. PFS was 87.2% and 84.6% at 3 and 5 years. OS was 91.5% and 89.1% at 3 and 5 years. Six patients (13%) experienced locoregional failure, and two (4%) developed distant metastases. 7/8 treatment failures (87.5%) occurred in patients with extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rdCRT following IC yields durable disease control in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, with outcomes comparable to historical benchmarks. Extended follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of this de-escalation strategy, even in patients with aggressive disease characteristics, but also underscores the need for careful patient selection, particularly in those with extracapsular extension.</description>

METHODS: Participants in this multisite, randomized clinical trial were randomized to APCD or UC. The primary endpoint was severity of lymphedema symptoms. Secondary endpoints were anatomical lymphedema changes, biopsychosocial outcomes, and barriers to care. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six participants were enrolled (119 APCD, 117 UC). Analysis was intention-to-treat. Lymphedema-associated symptom burden measured using the VHNSS and LSIDS was improved to a similar degree in both groups. APCD demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in external soft tissue swelling assessed by digital photography. No difference in CT imaging measures of lymphedema was noted. UC participants experienced barriers to care. CONCLUSIONS: APCD is an effective treatment for lymphedema in HNCS. The APCD addresses clinically significant barriers to therapist guided treatment. A hybrid approach may be complementary and optimize patient outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT04797390.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter randomized phase II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of nivolumab before chemoradiation in a high-risk population, providing important insights into treatment strategies for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, though it is not a phase III trial and the sample size is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mirghani H, Aupérin A, Even C, Larive A, Fayette J, Geoffrois L, Clatot F, Calderon B, Tao Y, Nguyen F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00835'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00835&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570275/'&gt;41570275&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and advanced stage and/or significant smoking history are at higher risk of relapse. Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study evaluates the prognostic value of a ctDNA-based MRD assay in a significant patient population with HPV-independent HNSCC, addressing an important clinical question and potentially influencing management strategies, though it is not a randomized trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruiz-Torres DA, Roberts TJ, Du P, Mendel J, Neagele S, Bonora G, Zhang F, Efthymiou V, Merkin RD, Lin DT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569592/'&gt;41569592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Recurrence rates for locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are high. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

This cancer-related inflammatory response is reflected by a biomarker named the systemic inflammatory response (SIRI). SIRI is calculated by multiplying the peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte counts and dividing by the lymphocyte count is a biomarker that has shown prognostic capacity in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of SIRI data for head and neck cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis using a mixed-effects model was performed to estimate the overall effect size of prognostic capacity. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival and progression-free survival, with effect sizes measured as log hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data on overall survival revealed a pooled HR of 2.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). This indicates higher SIRI patients are at greater risk of mortality relative to lower SIRI patients. Additionally, 3 studies reported metrics on progression-free survival, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (1.72, 3.13) (p &lt; 0.0001). Minimal heterogeneity was observed for progression-free survival (I2 = 0%, p&lt; 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI portends worse overall survival. Since SIRI correlates to immune function and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity, these factors are among those most likely to be impacted by altered SIRI parameters.</description>

The study aims were to analyze the incidence of CPG and to assess treatment outcomes in relation to histopathology, preoperative diagnosis and adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR), including 1,018 patients diagnosed with CPG between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence remained stable with a mean of 0.9 (range 0.65-1.08) cases per 100,000 person-years (ASR-Europe). Curative treatment was administered to 90 % of the patients, with a recurrence rate of 9 % within 3 years. The highest recurrence rates were observed in patients with salivary duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while patients with acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas had lower recurrence rates. For stage I-II tumors, the 5-year relative survival was unaffected by whether the malignant diagnosis was known preoperatively. Male sex, increasing age, stage III-IV disease, and a World Health Organization/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (WHO/ECOG) performance status 2-4 was independently associated with increased overall mortality risk, whereas the timing of adjuvant radiotherapy was not. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to establishing the incidence and treatment outcomes of CPG in Sweden and highlights the diverse histopathological diagnoses of these tumors. Notably, unknown malignancy at the time of surgery did not impact survival in early-stage disease, and the timing of postoperative radiotherapy was not associated with overall survival.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study utilizes advanced single-cell RNA sequencing to uncover immunological mechanisms of chemoresistance in HPSCC, providing important insights that could influence treatment strategies, although it is based on a relatively small sample size and does not present a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li G, Xiao W, Wu H, Liu C, Gong L, Zhang H, Shao Z, Bai J, Xia X, Yi X, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68676-x'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-68676-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41565699/'&gt;41565699&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC), an aggressive head and neck cancer with dismal prognosis, faces persistent chemoresistance to standard TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) regimen. However, the immunological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain undefined. Here, we perform longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of paired pre-/post-TPF HPSCC specimens, mapping immune cell dynamics underlying chemoresistance. Our study identifies ZNF683+ natural killer (NK) cells as a gatekeeper of chemotherapy efficacy through integrated single-cell transcriptomics, spatial multiplex immunohistochemistry and functional validation. Moreover, pretreatment baseline enrichment of ZNF683+ NK cells predicts TPF response, while GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells function as the predominant immunologic effector to successful TPF intervention. Mechanistically, bioinformatics and in vitro coculture data reveal that ZNF683+ NK cells directly interact with CD8+ T cells, and drive an MHC-I-dependent licensing of polyfunctional GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells. Collectively, this NK-CD8+ axis provides a potential predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in patients with HPSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective cohort of 1870 patients and provides important insights into the prognostic significance of minimal extrathyroidal extension in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which could influence clinical practice regarding recurrence risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kang S, Bai H, Liu H, Wang Y, Hu X, Xu H, Wang A, Lyu Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70172'&gt;10.1002/hed.70172&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41550062/'&gt;41550062&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The updated American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system has excluded minimal extrathyroidal extension (mETE) from the T3 category. However, mETE remains classified as an intermediate-risk feature for recurrence in thyroid cancer. The prognostic significance of mETE and its association with recurrence risk remain subjects of ongoing debate. METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 1870 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (TT) with central lymph node dissection (CLND) between 2015 and 2020. Cox proportional hazards regression models and subgroup analyses were employed to evaluate the association of mETE with structural recurrence. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 27.9 months, 124 patients (6.6%) experienced structural recurrence. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with mETE than in those without (11.0% vs. 5.6%, p &lt; 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that mETE was an independent risk factor, particularly in patients with bilateral tumors (HR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.8-4.95) and those without Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.53-3.63). A significant interaction between tumor bilaterality and mETE was observed (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with PTC, mETE is a significant prognostic factor of structural recurrence and is associated with decreased disease-free survival (DFS). Critically, we demonstrate for the first time that mETE elevates recurrence risk to near the ATA intermediate-high threshold (17.6%) in bilateral PTC, regardless of tumor size. This synergy of mETE and bilaterality supports upgrading risk stratification and intensifying surveillance for this subset.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis includes a large sample size of 2641 pediatric patients and provides important insights into prognostic factors for differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma, though it does not present novel therapeutic findings or practice-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Canali L, Pace GM, Zimello C, Cerri L, Costantino A, Gaino F, Malvezzi L, Spriano G, Paderno A, Ferreli F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70180'&gt;10.1002/hed.70180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41574652/'&gt;41574652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), multifocality, and lateral neck lymph node metastasis on survival outcomes for pediatric patients with differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

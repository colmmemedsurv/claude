      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This large retrospective analysis of over 200,000 patients provides important insights into the survival impact of immunotherapy in advanced HNSCC, with significant findings regarding overall survival that could influence treatment approaches, though it lacks the rigor of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vuppala R, Long S, Sharbel D, Weir F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70140'&gt;10.1002/hed.70140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41450282/'&gt;41450282&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: We evaluated the association between immunotherapy (IO) and overall survival (OS) in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and examined outcomes by IO timing. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of national NCDB 2004-2022 United States adults with Stages III-IVB HNSCC. Exposure was any IO. The primary outcome was OS from diagnosis; analyses used multivariable Cox models, 24-month landmarking, and propensity methods. RESULTS: Among 221 116 patients (mean age: 62), 10 023 (4.5%) received IO. Median follow-up 37 months. IO was associated with lower mortality (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Landmark analysis showed benefit 0-24 months (HR: 0.76; 0.74-0.79) that reversed thereafter (HR: 1.09; 1.04-1.14). By intent, median OS was 53.2 months (neoadjuvant), 50.1 months (adjuvant), 16.5 months (later-line), versus 60.7 months without IO. Propensity analyses attenuated effects (HR: ~1.00). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world advanced HNSCC, IO confers modest early benefit with varied long-term results; outcomes vary by timing. Prospective biomarker-stratified trials are needed.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter cohort study analyzes a large sample size (n=9753) and provides important insights into the prognostic value of thyroglobulin levels in low- to intermediate-risk thyroid cancer, which could influence clinical practice and risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Kim M, Lee EK, Kim KJ, Shin SM, Jang J, Shin JY, Jin M, Bae JS, Kim K, Kim WG, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256251409134'&gt;10.1177/10507256251409134&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467912/'&gt;41467912&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Background: The prognostic value of unstimulated serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels for structural recurrence in patients with low- to intermediate-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who underwent total thyroidectomy but did not receive radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy remains unclear. This study aimed to determine Tg cutoff values and evaluate the role of dynamic Tg monitoring in risk stratification in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 9753 patients with low- to intermediate-risk DTC who underwent total thyroidectomy without RAI at 11 Korean tertiary hospitals. Serum Tg levels were measured under thyrotropin suppression (&lt;2 mIU/L) at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively using high-sensitive assays (functional sensitivity, &lt;0.2 ng/mL). Optimal Tg cutoffs were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves and survival analyses. Results: Higher postoperative unstimulated Tg levels consistently predicted structural recurrence, with an optimal cutoff of 0.3 ng/mL (area under the curve: 0.815, 0.772, and 0.816 at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively). A Tg ≥ 0.2 ng/mL, the Korean Thyroid Association (KTA) guideline cutoff for biochemical remission (excellent response), showed high sensitivity for recurrence. Tg ≥ 5.0 ng/mL at 6 months, a KTA-defined threshold for a biochemical incomplete response, independently predicted an elevated recurrence risk. Kaplan-Meier curves showed stepwise declines in recurrence-free survival with increasing Tg levels. Notably, even Tg &lt; 0.2 or &lt; 0.3 ng/mL were associated with recurrence if levels rose over time. Conclusion: Unstimulated Tg levels are strongly associated with the risk of structural recurrence in patients with DTC who have undergone total thyroidectomy without RAI. The current cutoff values of 0.2 ng/mL and 5.0 ng/mL were clinically relevant, and Tg kinetics over time further improved risk stratification. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence from an East Asian cohort and underscore the importance of early, serial Tg assessment in this growing patient population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis with a significant sample size (n=1514) focused on developing a predictive tool for central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, which has clinical implications for management strategies, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings characteristic of higher impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhang W, Wu X, Wang Y, Le Q, Xie Y, Yu K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107842'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107842&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478265/'&gt;41478265&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The global incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) continues to rise, and the optimal management strategy remains controversial due to its generally favorable prognosis. Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is an important predictor of recurrence and survival and therefore plays a critical role in guiding therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of CLNM in PTMC patients. METHODS: Patients from ward A (n = 877) were assigned to the training cohort, and those from ward B (n = 637) formed the validation cohort. Clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of CLNM, which were subsequently incorporated into a predictive nomogram. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified gender, age, maximum tumor diameter (MTD), multifocality, calcification and capsule status as significantly associated with CLNM (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed gender, age, MTD, multifocality, and capsule status as independent predictors. The nomogram demonstrated good discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.724 in the training cohort and 0.708 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and DCA confirmed favorable clinical utility. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed and validated a clinically applicable nomogram that integrates preoperative clinical and ultrasonographic features to predict CLNM in PTMC patients. This model may assist clinicians in tailoring surgical strategies and optimizing individualized management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized phase II trial with a focus on improving quality of life in HNSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy, which addresses an important clinical question, although its single-center design and phase II status limit its overall impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiao G, Ning L, Chen L, Zhang S, Chen Y, Chen Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107844'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107844&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478264/'&gt;41478264&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) significantly impairs patients' quality of life (QoL). While neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy offers potential survival benefits, it is associated with substantial treatment-related toxicities, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and functional decline. Exercise therapy has shown promise in improving QoL in other cancers, but its role in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy remains underexplored. METHODS: This single-center, open-label, randomized phase II trial enrolled 114 HNSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to an exercise group (personalized breathing and aerobic exercise program) or a control group (routine care). Outcomes were assessed using the BFI-C, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&amp;N35, and PSQI at baseline, after 2 cycles, and after 3 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The exercise group demonstrated significantly lower fatigue scores (BFI) after 2 and 3 cycles compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05). Sleep quality (PSQI) improved significantly in the exercise group and worsened in the control group. The exercise group also showed better outcomes in physical functioning, fatigue and insomnia. CONCLUSION: Exercise therapy is feasible and effective in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Early integration of exercise may mitigate treatment-related symptoms and improve tolerance and overall QoL.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is a large prospective cohort analysis with over 5000 participants investigating the prevalence and dynamics of oral HPV infection, which has important implications for understanding head and neck cancer risk, although it does not directly address treatment or clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vani NV, Madhanagopal R, Subramanian MJ, Sundersingh S, Helen AX, Meenakumari B, Rao DM, Ganesan TS, Swaminathan R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70298'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70298&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467594/'&gt;41467594&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancers (HNC), particularly oropharyngeal cancer. This longitudinal cohort study investigated the prevalence and dynamics of oral HPV infection among healthy adults in South India. A total of 5325 participants were enrolled, and demographic, behavioral, and oral gargle samples were collected. HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected using nested PCR (PGMY/GP) and genotyped by Sanger sequencing. HPV16 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and validated using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios. At baseline, 5011 samples were analyzed; 274 (5.5%) were HPV-positive and 4737 were negative. Among 3792 initially HPV-negative participants followed up, 126 (3.3%) acquired new infections (median 8 months; range, 6-15 months). Of 274 baseline HPV-positive individuals, 241 were followed up: 24 (10%) showed persistence, while 217 (90%) cleared infection after a median of 9 months (range, 6-20 months). Sanger sequencing of 471 samples from prevalent and incident infections yielded 290 (61.6%) high-quality sequences; 284 (98%) were HPV16, with isolated detections of HPV18, HPV66, HPV70, and HPV89. Ten novel variants were identified-nine HPV16 and one HPV89-while remaining sequences aligned with established Indian cervical HPV lineages. None of the 176 HPV16 DNA-positive samples analyzed expressed mRNA by RT-PCR, confirmed in 136 samples using ddPCR. Oral HPV infection among healthy individuals in India appears predominantly transient. Long-term monitoring may elucidate the oncogenic potential of oral HPV in this population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This consensus guideline paper addresses important clinical practices in TORS for head and neck cancer, involving expert consensus which can influence surgical standards, but it lacks the robust evidence from randomized trials or large prospective studies that would elevate its impact further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lechien JR, Paleri V, Baudouin R, Brunet A, Chiesa-Estomba CM, Crosetti E, De Vito A, Cammaroto G, De Virgilio A, Fakhry N, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107826'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107826&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41455326/'&gt;41455326&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Substantial heterogeneity in practice exists across centers regarding the indications and perioperative care for patients undergoing transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for head and neck cancer. This consensus paper aims to propose a European surgical practice guideline in this setting. METHODS: Twenty-two experts from European and International scientific societies participated in a modified Delphi process for rating and validating statements about indications, contraindications, surgical outcomes, and pre- and postoperative care associated with TORS for head and neck cancer care. Consensus was deemed to have been achieved when two-thirds of experts agreed or strongly agreed with the statement; those with fewer than one-third agreement were improved and resubmitted for voting until final validation or rejection. RESULTS: Of the initial 41 statements, 38 reached consensus after three voting rounds. Statements propose recommendations for the preoperative assessment (n = 7), indications and contraindications for TORS in oropharyngeal, laryngeal, and hypopharyngeal primaries (n = 10), surgical outcomes to be reported (n = 7), postoperative care (n = 8), and clinical research (n = 6). TORS is appropriate for small, accessible oropharyngeal and supraglottic tumors with favorable exposure. The contraindications set out in detail for oropharyngeal, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal lesions will assist in decision-making, especially when presented with a controversial clinical scenario. Standardized reporting of surgical, functional, and oncological outcomes, including swallowing, voice quality, and survival rates, is essential for evidence-based practice. TORS represents a promising avenue for therapeutic de-escalation in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers. CONCLUSION: The European TORS surgical consensus provides clinical recommendations for the indications, contraindications, surgical and perioperative care for TORS management of head and neck malignancies.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding patient-reported outcomes in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, which can influence treatment decisions and shared decision-making, though it does not present novel therapeutic findings or a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; van Dijk SPJ, Blanco MMK, McMullin JL, Gazelle GS, Jalali MS, Chhatwal J, Gartland RM, Husson O, Hu Y, Swan JS, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4670'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4670&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41452620/'&gt;41452620&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Given the favorable prognosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), treatment decisions increasingly rely on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Comparative HRQOL data between active surveillance, thermal ablation, and surgery remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare HRQOL among adults with PTMC undergoing active surveillance, thermal ablation, or surgery to inform shared decision-making. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 17, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included adult patients with PTMC and compared at least 2 relevant interventions while reporting PROs. Studies restricted to noncomparative designs or non-PTMC populations were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving discrepancies with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S guidelines; the meta-analysis adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified by a second. Study quality was assessed using established critical appraisal checklists. Random-effects models were applied to obtain mean differences with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was domain-specific HRQOL (eg, voice problems, neuromuscular symptoms, psychological distress), as measured using the Thyroid Cancer Quality of Life (THYCA-QOL), Korean Thyroid-specific Quality of Life (KT-QOL), and other validated instruments. RESULTS: Of 988 retrieved records, 13 studies comprising 5793 patients were included: 2356 underwent active surveillance, 242 received thermal ablation (211 radiofrequency, 31 laser), and 3195 underwent surgery (2350 lobectomy, 833 total thyroidectomy, 12 unspecified). Active surveillance was consistently associated with better PROs compared with surgery across thyroid-specific domains, including neuromuscular symptoms, voice problems, concentration issues, psychological distress, sympathetic complaints, feelings of being chilly, and scar-related concerns. Generic instruments (eg, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, version 2) supported these findings. Low-certainty evidence indicated that thermal ablation was associated with better HRQOL than surgery after 3 to 6 months, although these differences diminished by 12 months. Across studies, heterogeneity arose from differences in treatment strategies and comparators, outcome instruments and duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that patients whose PTMC was managed with active surveillance reported equal or better HRQOL than those undergoing surgery. These findings support the importance of incorporating PROs into shared decision-making for low-risk thyroid cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset from the SEER database with over 2400 cases and employs robust statistical methods to analyze the impact of neck dissection on survival in T1N0M0 OTSCC, providing important insights that could influence clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Z, Zhao Y, Ming H, Zhang X, Tan X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral diseases | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.70170'&gt;10.1111/odi.70170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449832/'&gt;41449832&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To identify T1N0M0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) patient subgroups benefiting most from neck dissection (ND) based on the SEER database. METHODS: Patients with T1N0M0 OTSCC were identified from the SEER database. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was utilized to balance baseline characteristics between ND and non-ND groups. Survival differences between these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and log-rank tests. Additionally, a multivariable Cox regression model was applied to the pre-matched cohort to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 2426 cases were included. In the multivariable model adjusted for key prognosticators, ND was an independent factor associated with significantly improved OS and DSS. After PSM, 1702 well-balanced patients were analyzed. Subgroup analyses based on tumor characteristics revealed that favorable survival outcomes associated with ND were predominantly observed in patients with tumor sizes 11-20 mm and those with moderate or poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with small tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, survival outcomes were comparable between the ND and observation groups. CONCLUSION: ND was associated with improved survival for T1N0M0 OTSCC patients with 11-20 mm tumors and moderate/poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with smaller tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, the observation strategy had demonstrated survival benefits comparable to ND.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important epidemiological insights into race-specific trends of HPV-related cancers in South Africa, which could inform targeted prevention efforts, but it is based on retrospective registry data and lacks the robustness of prospective studies or RCTs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tsegaye AT, Mashele SA, Shing JZ, Mwansa-Kambafwile J, Kreimer AR, Metekoua C, Shiels MS, Muchengeti M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70323'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70323&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41472527/'&gt;41472527&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluating trends in HPV-related cancer rates by race is essential for identifying high-risk populations and improving prevention efforts. Using 2011-2022 South African National Cancer Registry data, we analyzed age-standardized incidence rates by race and sex across three periods (2011-2014, 2015-2018, 2019-2022) using linear regression. Significant increases were observed for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) among White females (p &lt; .01), vulvar SCC among Asian (p &lt; .01) and Black (p = .02) females, and anal SCC among Colored females and Black males (p &lt; .01). Cervical carcinoma rates remained stable for most racial groups, except for the annual trends showing a 1.9% increase per year (95% CI = 1.0, 2.7) among White females. These findings suggest rising incidence rates for some HPV-related cancers across racial groups in South Africa. Further research is needed to explore the constellation of risk factors contributing to these trends and to guide targeted interventions.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This large retrospective study analyzes 36,626 cases of head and neck cancer over 40 years, providing valuable epidemiological insights and trends, but lacks the prospective design and clinical applicability needed for higher impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jakobsen KK, H Rasmussen J, Melchiors J, Agander TK, von Buchwald C, Grønhøj C&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107843'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107843&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41475069/'&gt;41475069&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Head and neck cancers (HNCs) encompass various malignancies with variation in anatomical site, histology, and survival outcomes. This study aims to describe HNC incidence and survival trends in Denmark from 1980 to 2021. PATIENTS/MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective, cohort study used data from the Danish Cancer Registry and the Central Population Register to include all HNC cases in the upper aerodigestive tract from 1980 to 2021. Incidence rates were age-adjusted and survival analyzed as relative survival rates compared to the general population. Average Annual Percent Change (AAPC) in incidence was calculated using linear regression models. RESULTS: A total of 36,626 HNC cases were included. The age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) increased significantly from 7.1 in 1980 to 12.5 per 100,000 in 2021. From 2015 to 2021, oropharyngeal cancer was the most common HNC. Further, oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated the highest 5-year relative survival of 70.1 % [95 % CI: 67.9-72.4]. Hypopharyngeal cancer had the lowest survival (26.8 % [95 % CI: 25.1 to 28.7]). Overall, the 5-year relative survival improved during the study period from 46.9 % [95 % CI: 44.7-49.2] in 1980-1984 to 65.2 % [95 % CI: 63.8 to 66.6] in 2015-2019. INTERPRETATION: Our study showed a continued increase in incidence for HNC alongside an improvement in survival. The survival varied notably across different tumor subsite. Continued research is essential to address these variations and improve outcomes across cancer subsites. Exploring opportunities for treatment de-escalation to mitigate the toxicity associated with current therapies is essential to optimizing long-term quality of life for survivors.</description>

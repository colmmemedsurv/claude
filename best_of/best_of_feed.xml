      <description>&lt;h3&gt;🔥 CRITICAL - Score: 90/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial presents long-term survival data comparing lobaplatin to cisplatin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, demonstrating non-inferior outcomes with potentially reduced toxicity, indicating significant clinical implications for treatment guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao X, Zhou JY, Huang HY, Guo L, Huang YY, Qiu WZ, Lin ZC, Cao KJ, Mo HY, Li XM, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69315-1'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-69315-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41667463/'&gt;41667463&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects. More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI -6.7-9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1-2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1-2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1-2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;🔥 CRITICAL - Score: 90/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 trial evaluating a novel PD-1 inhibitor in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy for high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which has the potential to significantly impact treatment guidelines and improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; You R, Xu GQ, Ding X, Liang JH, Liu ZG, Zou X, Liu YP, Hu GY, Liu YM, Duan CY, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMJ (Clinical research ed.) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2025-085863'&gt;10.1136/bmj-2025-085863&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41667193/'&gt;41667193&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To assess treatment with camrelizumab (a programmed death 1 inhibitor) in addition to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment in patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Seven hospitals in China between 18 August 2020 and 21 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-70 years with newly diagnosed high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after three cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (stage 4a, stage 2-3 with stable or progressive disease, or detectable Epstein-Barr virus DNA). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive combination chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin (standard treatment group) or standard treatment with 19 cycles of intravenous camrelizumab (200 mg) once every three weeks (radiotherapy plus two concurrent cycles and 17 adjuvant cycles; camrelizumab group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat group was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: 390 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=194) or the standard treatment group (n=196). At median follow-up of 39.9 months (interquartile range 36.8-43.4 months), progression-free survival was higher in the camrelizumab group than the standard treatment group (36 months: 83.4%, 95% confidence interval 78.3% to 88.8% v 71.3%, 65.2% to 77.9%; stratified hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77, P=0.001). The incidence of acute and late adverse events (grade 3 or 4) was 50.5% and 3.2% in the camrelizumab group compared with 48.7% and 3.7% in the standard treatment group. Immunological adverse events (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 19 patients (10.2%) in the camrelizumab group. CONCLUSION: The addition of camrelizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment improved progression-free survival among patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after induction chemotherapy.

We previously reported the discovery of a tumor DNA methylation signature of hypoxia (Hypoxia-M), identifying HNSCC patients at risk for local recurrence (LR), all event progression, and death after primary radiochemotherapy (RCHT). We further validate Hypoxia-M in an independent cohort of HNSCC patients who underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) METHODS: Hypoxia-M was validated in HPV-negative HNSCC patients (n = 134) homogeneously treated with PORT-C in the frame of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) multicenter biomarker trial. DNA methylation was profiled using Illumina450K technology. The performance of Hypoxia-M was integrated with previously reported biomarkers, including gene expression signatures (GES) of hypoxia, a methylome-based HPV-Independent Classifier of disease Recurrence (HICR), and immune cell score using immunohistochemistry (CD3/CD8/PD-L1/PD1). RESULTS: Hypoxia-M was independently prognostic for overall survival (OS, HR = 2.34, p = 0.03) and distant metastasis (DM, HR = 4.3, p = 0.001), but not for LR after PORT-C. Hypoxia-M remained significant after adjusting for patientś age, gender, smoking status, tumor stage, and high-risk features (ECE&amp;/R1 resection). Hypoxia-M status was inversely associated with CD8 T-cell infiltration. Patient stratification improved by integrating previously reported biomarkers, with Hypoxia-M demonstrating independent prognostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of Hypoxia-M was validated in an independent cohort. Our results highlighted a difference in recurrence patterns of hypoxic tumors treated in the primary setting (local recurrence) versus postoperatively (distant metastasis) and the utility of Hypoxia-M for identifying the main pattern of recurrence.</description>

Recent studies have suggested that this difference persists even after accounting for smoking and alcohol use, highlighting the need to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that sex differences in HNSCC are androgen-dependent and identified androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and function. Mechanically, early growth response 4 (EGR4) functioned as a direct downstream transcriptional effector of AR that induced CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction. Clinically, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was an effective therapeutic strategy in HNSCC, suppressing tumor growth in mice while improving intratumoral CD8⁺ T cell function. Moreover, combining ADT with immune checkpoint inhibitors led to improved antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal ADT as a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the antitumor activity of sex-biased CD8⁺ T cells in HNSCC, which could inform the development of sex-biased immunotherapies for treating HNSCC patients.</description>

We aim to explore the effect of tobacco cessation on the risk of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC). A case-control study was conducted across five cancer centres in India. We enrolled 2320 BMC and 2302 frequency-matched controls. Information was collected on smoking and chewing (products, duration and quitting). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of tobacco cessation compared to current users, after adjusting for potential confounders. For both smoking and chewing, the odds reduced rapidly after 5 years of quitting, so that those who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago had only 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.54) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to smoke, and those who quit chewing ≥10 years ago had 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to chew. Chewing with areca nut was associated with almost double the risk of chewing without (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.53-2.26) but the rate of reduction of risk with quitting was similar. These findings show clearly the benefits of quitting and inform policies that emphasize chewing tobacco cessation, given its widespread prevalence in India.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an SGC-specific pTNM classification with improved prognostic accuracy and optimized stage distribution for version nine of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging protocol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a moderate-sized analysis (n=102) identifying TRIM25 as a potential prognostic marker in Merkel cell carcinoma, which could have clinical implications, but it lacks the robust evidence of a randomized controlled trial or large prospective study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fagerstedt KW, Kilpinen S, Arola J, Sundqvist BZ, Böhling T, Andersson LC, Sihto H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70384'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70384&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41689405/'&gt;41689405&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine skin cancer, most often driven by integration of Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). While anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have improved outcomes, reliable prognostic biomarkers remain limited. Tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), a critical activator of innate immunity, was evaluated here for its clinical and biological relevance in MCC. We analysed TRIM25 mRNA and protein expression in 102 MCC cases and 9 MCC cell lines, respectively, and assessed associations with MCPyV status, clinicopathological characteristics and patient survival. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to identify pathways associated with TRIM25 expression in both low and high TRIM25-expressing tumour groups. High TRIM25 expression was significantly associated with MCPyV positivity in both patient tumours (p = .004) and cell lines (p = .016), and TRIM25 and MCPyV mRNA levels correlated positively in tumours (r = 0.264, p = .013). Patients with low TRIM25 expression had a significantly poorer 5-year disease-specific survival than those with high expression (53% vs. 78%, p = .013). Notably, Cox multivariate analysis confirmed that TRIM25 serves as an independent prognostic marker, irrespective of MCPyV status. Pathway analysis revealed that low TRIM25 expression was linked to antigen presentation pathways, while high TRIM25 expression was associated with cell cycle regulation. Our findings suggest that TRIM25 serves as a valuable prognostic biomarker in MCC. Additionally, TRIM25 may play a pathogenic role in MCPyV-positive tumours, warranting further investigation to elucidate its mechanistic involvement in MCC tumourigenesis.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This cohort study analyzes treatment pathways in salivary gland malignancies using a multidisciplinary approach, providing important insights into clinical outcomes, but it is a retrospective analysis with a moderate sample size that does not present novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Feldmann N, Wichmann G, Dietz A, Pirlich M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70382'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70382&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-14&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41689399/'&gt;41689399&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Salivary gland malignancies (SGM) are heterogeneous regarding origin, biology and prognosis. We investigated patterns of clinical and pathological features and outcome differences attributable to standardized decision making for treatment pathways before and after establishing our multidisciplinary tumor board (MDTB) in 2007. We retrospectively analyzed data of electronic health records, the Saxon cancer registry and the clinic's tumor database (1990-2024). Statistical analysis included contingency tables, Pearson's chi-squared tests for categorical, Student's t test for numerical data, Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival plots and log-rank tests for time-dependent outcome measures. Among 200 patients, 83 were diagnosed before and 117 since 2007. Treatment modalities included surgery in 93% of cases, with 33.5% receiving adjuvant radiotherapy and 12.5% receiving adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. We observed disease progression in 50% of patients. Locoregional free survival was superior since 2007 (p = .035). Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) decreased related to earlier detection of distant metastasis (M1) linked to prevention of deaths from the index cancer in patients with M1 at diagnosis or relapse (rM1) since 2007 (p = .120). Moreover, conditional OS was not affected for patients with M1/rM1 diagnosis by numerically increased detection of distant metastasis since 2007 (p = .574). MDTB decision making at a certified cancer center is accompanied by increasing numbers of diagnosis of SGM and better locoregional control but not DMFS due to higher metastasis detection rate and treatment. Despite excellent and numerically improved disease-specific survival, 10-years OS remained similar.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large national database to analyze demographic and prognostic factors of a rare cancer, providing important insights that could influence understanding and management of adenoid cystic carcinoma, though it is a retrospective analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang J, Dumonsau J, Grossmann N, Silberstein P, Varman R, DiBlasi M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2026.103022'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2026.103022&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41689993/'&gt;41689993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy comprising just 1 % of all head and neck malignancies. To date, there are no National Cancer Database (NCDB) studies evaluating the demographic and prognostic factors of ACC of the head and neck. Existing studies have only utilized single-institution cohorts, other databases, and narrowly defined populations, resulting in a fragmented view. This study aims to address this by providing an NCDB analysis of all patients with ACC in the head and neck. METHODS: Utilizing retrospective 2004-2021 NCDB data, this study analyzed several variables including patient demographics, prognostic factors, and treatment modalities. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted for overall survival, Cox Regression Models were utilized to assess hazard ratios (HRs), and binomial regression for surgical likelihood. RESULTS: ACC was most frequently located in the major salivary glands (45.2 %). The mean age at diagnosis was 58.75 years. Surgical intervention significantly improved survival, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.302 to 0.451 compared to no surgery. Overall, 69.8 % of patients received surgery. Factors associated with lower surgical likelihood included higher Charlson-Deyo scores, uninsured status, and older age. Tumor site influenced outcomes: surgically accessible sites such as the gums and oral cavity were associated with improved survival (HR 0.875), while less accessible sites like the nasopharynx and pharynx had worse outcomes (HR 1.868 and 1.123, respectively). CONCLUSION: Surgical treatment confers a significant survival advantage in head and neck ACC. Disparities in surgical receipt based on insurance status, comorbidities, age, and tumor location highlight the need for strategies to improve equitable access to care.</description>

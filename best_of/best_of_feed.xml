      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study addresses a critical evidence gap in treating R/M SCCHN after pembrolizumab failure, presenting a novel combination therapy with potential clinical implications, although it is not a phase 3 trial and the sample size is not specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fuereder T, Klinghammer K, Hahn D, Grünberger B, Melchardt T, Greil R, Kocher F, Gamerith G, Wagner C, Berchtold L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; ESMO open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2026.106061'&gt;10.1016/j.esmoop.2026.106061&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41650746/'&gt;41650746&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: No standard second-line treatment has been established for patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy, representing a critical evidence gap in current clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based regimens, received paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 every 21 days plus weekly cetuximab (C) 250 mg/m2 for up to six cycles, followed by C maintenance. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best overall response (BoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age 64 years). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had a primary tumor in the oropharynx, 17 (29.8%) in the oral cavity, 9 (15.8%) in the hypopharynx, and 6 (10.5%) in the larynx. The ORR was 43.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7% to 57.6%], the BoR was 47.4% (95% CI 34.0% to 61.0%) with nine (15.8%) complete responses, and the DCR was 71.9% (95% CI 58.5% to 83.0%). DoR was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.1 months-not reached). Median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI 5.5-8.4 months) and 12.2 months (95% CI 10.5-17.6 months), respectively. Six-month PFS and OS rates were 49.0% and 73.0%, respectively. The most frequent non-hematological treatment-related adverse events were C-associated skin rash (78.9%) and PTX-related polyneuropathy (35.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective trial specifically evaluating PTX plus C after failure of first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with R/M SCCHN. The observed clinical activity and tolerability support this widely available regimen as a potential standard-of-care option in the absence of randomized evidence in this setting.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials addresses an important clinical question regarding the use of surgical drains in thyroid surgery, potentially influencing surgical practices and outcomes, though it is published in a specialty journal rather than a top-tier one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Al-Taie DS, Mughal Z, Lotfallah A, Fussey J, Deutsch P, Warner G, Daultrey CR, Ayshford C, Gupta KK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-026-10015-3'&gt;10.1007/s00405-026-10015-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41622270/'&gt;41622270&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Thyroidectomy is a commonly performed procedure with potential complications such as haematoma and seroma, which can result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Surgical drains have traditionally been used to mitigate these risks, but their necessity is increasingly debated due to concerns over pain, infection, and prolonged hospitalisation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of using surgical drains following thyroidectomy. This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials aimed to compare postoperative surgical outcomes in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery, managed with or without drains. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, EMCARE, and CINAHL) were systematically searched in August 2025 for articles published between January 1995 and August 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes in patients undergoing thyroidectomy with and without drains were included. Of the initial 119 articles identified, 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis, representing 1,078 patients. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pooled proportions were calculated and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method. The random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was then conducted using inverse variance weighting, with between-study variance (τ2) estimated via the DerSimonian and Laird method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included haematoma and seroma rates; secondary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI), return-to-theatre (RTT), postoperative pain, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Pooled complication rates were: haematoma 1.6%, seroma 3.7%, SSI 2.5%, and RTT 0.2%. Drain use was not associated with significant differences in haematoma (p = 0.15), seroma (p = 0.64), or RTT (p = 0.22). However, SSI (4.2% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.01), LOS (mean difference [MD] = 1.2 days; p &lt; 0.0001), and pain (MD = 2.2; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the drain group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Routine placement of drains after all types of thyroidectomies does not significantly decrease the rates of haematoma, seroma, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and is linked to higher rates of surgical site infection, pain, and length of stay. A selective, patient-specific approach to drain use is recommended.</description>

The purpose of this study is to perform the first meta-analysis examining intraoperative margin assessment methods in OCSCC with the goal of determining if there is a significant difference in patient outcomes between specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Studies met inclusion criteria if they conducted intraoperative specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis in patients with OCSCC and reported patient outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze the compiled data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 1988 articles for initial review of which 9 (1240 participants) met criteria for inclusion and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that a specimen-based approach is associated with higher intraoperative re-resection rate (P &lt; .05), significantly lower final positive margin rate (P &lt; .05), and decreased local recurrence when compared to the tumor bed-based approach (P &lt; .05). However, there was no significant difference in overall recurrence when comparing intraoperative margin analysis methods (P &gt; .05). Additionally, none of the included studies noted a significant difference in survival outcomes between tumor bed versus specimen-based methods. CONCLUSION: Specimen-based frozen margin analysis in OCSCC results in lower false negative rates and improved local control; however, there is no significant difference in overall recurrence or survival when comparing specimen-based vs tumor bed-based techniques.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding the safety profiles of thyroidectomy in older adults, which is relevant given the aging population. While it synthesizes critical data, it does not present novel therapeutic findings or practice-changing results, placing it in the moderate impact category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ghani A, Ayesh AR, Rajaram H, Ganegoda SM, Alogakos M, Sato A, Hage K, Than CA, Nakanishi H, Shin J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642589/'&gt;41642589&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: A greater proportion of older patients (age ≥65 years) are undergoing thyroidectomy amidst an aging population. Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance. These findings support individualized counseling and perioperative planning while acknowledging the overall safety of thyroidectomy in this population.</description>

Our goal was to perform a large multicentre evaluation of WPOI as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective pathology data was collated from 14 institutions and compared with clinical outcome in 1374 OSCC patients with upfront curative resection. Most cases were of oral tongue (n = 645, 47%); T2 (33%) and N0 (59%). WPOI 1-3 frequency was 29.4%, WPOI 4 47% and WPOI 5 22%. On univariable analysis, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) was 54.2% for WPOI 5 vs. 69.7% for WPOI 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001). The locoregional control (LRC) was 68.9% vs 79.2% (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) 68.4% vs 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression in the entire cohort, WPOI 4 or 5 was strongly correlated with other known poor prognostic factors and not an independent predictor of OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.52), LRC or DFS. However, in early-stage (pT1-2 N0) patients treated with surgery alone without adjuvant radiotherapy, WPOI 5 was a robust independent predictor of DFS (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.54-12.32, p = 0.006), OS (HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.1, p = 0.020) and LRC (HR 3.52, 95% CI 2.13-5.82, p &lt;0.001) after applying inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. Furthermore, in the entire cohort of early-stage patients, interaction modeling showed that adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces the risk for both DFS and LRC for those with WPOI-5 (Interaction p = 0.002). Therefore, it may act as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. The prognostic and predictive role of WPOI-5 should be validated in prospective trials.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective study included 3578 NPC patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Ninety-four RTLI patients were recruited based on inclusion criteria and matched 1:1 with 97 control subjects using propensity scores. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 135) and the validation cohort (n = 59). Deep transfer learning (DTL) features and dosiomics features were extracted from ADC map and three-dimensional dose distribution, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were employed to identify predictive features. Subsequently, eight machine learning classification models were trained to establish a prediction framework, encompassing Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. The performance of clinical, DTL, dosiomics and feature fusion model was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We constructed six pre-trained transfer learning networks and extracted DTL features, respectively. The results showed that pre-trained WideResNet 101 exhibited superior performance with an AUC of 0.786 in the validation cohort. The clinical model based on D1cc and induction chemotherapy demonstrated an AUC of 0.794 and the dosiomics model demonstrated an AUC of 0.903. Features fusion model demonstrated the highest AUC values in both the training (0.988) and validation (0.940) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion model based on pretreatment ADC map and dose distribution provided a promising way to predict RTLI in NPC patients receiving IMRT, which can support clinicians in making decisions to develop individualized treatment plans and implement preventive measures.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multi-institutional study with a large cohort of 3928 patients provides important insights into predicting mandibular osteoradionecrosis, which can influence clinical practice, though it is a retrospective analysis and not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Humbert-Vidan L, Hansen CR, Petit S, Muñoz-Montplet C, Hueniken K, Mohamed ASR, Saunders DP, Patel V, Verduijn GM, Heemsbergen WD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.044'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.044&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642169/'&gt;41642169&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe late complication affecting patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated with radiation therapy (RT) that significantly impacts patients' quality of life and can require costly interventions. Although radiation dose is a key factor, other clinical and demographic risk factors also influence ORN development. Previous predictive models have primarily been single-institutional, limiting their generalizability. In this first analysis from the PREDMORN Consortium, we have aimed to reproduce existing statistical association and modeling analyses on the largest and most diverse mandibular ORN cohort worldwide to allow comparison with previous studies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective multi-institutional study included 3928 patients with HNC (622 ORN cases) from 8 institutions. Clinical, demographic, and dosimetric variables were analyzed to develop a prediction model (any grade ORN vs no ORN) using forward stepwise logistic regression with correlation-based variable preselection. The ORN normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was developed on 80% of data from 6 institutions, tested on the remaining unseen 20%, and externally validated on a matched cohort (58 patients, 19 ORN cases) and a large population-based cohort (2687 patients, 215 ORN cases). RESULTS: Key predictors of ORN were D30%, V70Gy, pre-RT dental extractions, and smoking status. The ORN NTCP model demonstrated very good calibration on the population-based external cohort (Brier score, 0.077; Log Loss, 0.281). Model discrimination improved on a subcohort including oropharyngeal and locally advanced larynx/hypopharynx cancer cases only (AUC from 0.69 to 0.75 and from 0.65 to 0.67 on the matched and the population-based external cohorts, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PREDMORN NTCP model is the largest multi-institutional effort to date aimed at predicting ORN risk in patients with HNC using real-world data. The model demonstrated good generalizability when externally validated to a large population-based cohort. Our observations align with current guidelines and corroborate findings from smaller single-institution studies.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This retrospective cohort study involves a substantial sample size of 1,088 patients and provides important insights into clinical and socioeconomic predictors of 60-day rehospitalization after head and neck surgery, which could have implications for patient management and resource allocation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Abdul-Rahman NH, Sridharan S, Spector ME, Snyderman CH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70164'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-06&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41649247/'&gt;41649247&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the association between clinical characteristics and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and 60-day re-presentation after oncologic head and neck surgery. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study involved 1,088 patients who underwent oncologic head and neck surgery from August 2012 to November 2024. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: The main outcome measure was 60-day Emergency Department (ED) visit or readmission after primary hospital discharge following surgery. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by state-level area deprivation index (ADI). RESULTS: Predictors of re-presentation within 60 days of discharge on univariate analysis include tumor stage 4 (OR: 1.52, 95% Cl: 1.01-2.31, P = .044), longer primary length of stay (OR: 1.03, 95% Cl: 1.01-1.05, P &lt; .001), and residency in the 4th quartile state ADI (OR: 1.54, 95% Cl: 1.03-2.31, P = .037). Multivariable logistic regression identified laryngeal cancer (OR: 1.60, 95% Cl: 1.16-2.21, 0.004) and discharge with home health or other care facilities (2.22, 95% Cl: 1.67-2.96, P &lt; .001) as predictive factors. Patients from low ADI neighborhoods (Q1-3) were more likely to be discharged home, whereas those from high ADI neighborhoods (Q4) where almost twice as likely to be discharged with home health or to care facilities than home alone (18.70% vs 10.29%, P = &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that clinical and systemic factors contribute to re-presentation to the hospital after major oncologic head and neck surgery. Addressing these factors through targeted policies and institutional initiatives may help mitigate the morbidity and cost associated with representation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This retrospective cross-sectional analysis provides important insights into the uptake of Medical Assistance in Dying for head and neck cancer patients, addressing a significant clinical question, but lacks the robustness of larger prospective studies or randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Curry T, Wener E, Odell M, Caulley L, Ramchandani R, Grant A, Thavorn K, Lasso A, Kilty S&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Laryngoscope | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.70410'&gt;10.1002/lary.70410&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41636338/'&gt;41636338&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: There is a paucity of information on the uptake of Medical Assistance in Dying (MAiD) for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Our study reports the prevalence, disease characteristics, and nature of the desire for MAiD in patients with HNC who underwent the process in Ontario. The aim is to better understand this population and identify gaps in our current system of care. METHODS: This is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis for the period June 17, 2016 to December 31, 2022. Data were received from the Office of the Chief Coroner Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: Three hundred and fifty-six persons received MAiD. The average age was 72.4 years (SD 12.22) with 260 of the patients being men (73.03%). The most common HNC primary tumor site was the oral cavity 109 (30.6%). The most reported reason was inadequate control of symptoms other than pain (79.21%) followed by inadequate pain control or concerns about it (75%). The patient's private residence (55.62%) was the most common setting. Patients were more likely to live in wealthier neighborhoods and in large urban centers. Future prediction of MAiD uptake shows a linear year-by-year increase. CONCLUSION: The use of MAiD in HNC has been steadily increasing since its legalization and is projected to continue increasing. There is a male predominance that is aligned with the incidence and prevalence of HNC nationally. Overall, MAiD is an increasingly employed choice for HNC patients receiving treatment for disease without curative intent.</description>

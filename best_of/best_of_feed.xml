      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a large prospective study with 550 patients exploring the optimal extent of lymph node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which addresses an important clinical question and has potential implications for surgical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang S, Cai H, Huang Z, Zhuge L, Wang Z, Liu W, Niu L, Yan D, Li Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70116'&gt;10.1002/hed.70116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41588625/'&gt;41588625&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is much controversy on the extent of lymph node dissection (LND) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) according to major guidelines. This study aims to explore the optimal extent of LND and discover a personalized and accurate surgical plan for pN1 PTC patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 550 patients with PTC who underwent initial surgery. For patients who were considered pN1a, LND of levels III and IV was completed. For patients who were considered LNM in levels III or IV, after taking 3-6 lymph nodes of level III for frozen pathological examination, if LNM was found, LND of levels II-IV was performed; otherwise, only levels III and IV were dissected, For patients who were considered to have LNM in level II, LND of levels II-V was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: 51.4% of patients with pN1a had postoperative pathologically confirmed occult LNM in levels III and IV. Among patients who underwent LND of levels II-IV due to positive lymph nodes in level III, 46.1% had occult LNM in level II. For patients with LNM in level II, the incidence of occult metastasis in level V was 20%. Only one patient presented with lymph node recurrence outside of the operative field. The proportion of patients with postoperative complications increased as the scope of dissection enlarged. CONCLUSION: Combined with the distribution of LNM and the number of subregions of LNM(n) in preoperative ultrasonography, it is suggested that the range of LND in the lateral neck of pN1 PTC should be n + 1/2 anatomical subregions.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter randomized phase II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of nivolumab before chemoradiation in a high-risk HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer population, presenting promising insights that could influence treatment strategies, though it is not a phase III trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mirghani H, Aupérin A, Even C, Larive A, Fayette J, Geoffrois L, Clatot F, Calderon B, Tao Y, Nguyen F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00835'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00835&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570275/'&gt;41570275&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and advanced stage and/or significant smoking history are at higher risk of relapse. Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study evaluates a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in a significant patient population with HPV-independent HNSCC, addressing an important clinical question with potential implications for management and surveillance, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruiz-Torres DA, Roberts TJ, Du P, Mendel J, Neagele S, Bonora G, Zhang F, Efthymiou V, Merkin RD, Lin DT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569592/'&gt;41569592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Recurrence rates for locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are high. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important insights into the genetic landscape and functional impact of alterations in recurrent and metastatic HPV-associated head and neck cancer, with a substantial sample size of 159 tumors. While it does not present a randomized controlled trial or practice-changing findings, it offers valuable information that could influence future research and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Prasad M, Cheng AT, Mayer M, Jansen L, Koh E, Nadeem Z, Sivan Pillai G, Vos J, Kuo F, Zhao K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3972'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3972&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41603724/'&gt;41603724&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Recurrent and metastatic human papillomavirus-associated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HPV+ HNSCC) remains largely incurable, with genetic drivers incompletely defined. We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective study, 500 NPC patients from four hospitals were allocated to training (n = 274), internal testing (n = 118), and external testing cohorts (n = 108). Rad features were extracted from MRI-defined carotid artery regions of interest, SRad features from K-means-derived subregions, and deep features from a SwinT backbone. Single-source and fusion models were developed. Discrimination (AUC), classification (ACC/SEN/SPE), calibration (Brier score and calibration curves), reclassification (NRI/IDI), and interpretability (SHAP) were assessed. RESULTS: RICAI was observed in 48.5%, 48.3%, and 54.6% of the training, internal testing, and external testing cohorts, respectively. Among single-source models, SwinT and SRad showed comparable performance, with Rad slightly inferior; all outperformed the clinical model. The fused Rad-SRad-SwinT achieved the best performance, with AUCs of 0.814 (95% CI: 0.737-0.891) in internal testing and 0.871 (95% CI: 0.794-0.932) in external testing, alongside favorable classification in external testing (ACC 0.815, SEN 0.763, SPE 0.878) and good calibration (Brier score 0.148). NRI/IDI analyses indicated significantly improved reclassification versus single-source models. SHAP analyses demonstrated that SwinT-derived features contributed most to model decisions, followed by SRad and Rad, supporting complementary gains from deep semantic representation and subregional heterogeneity quantification. CONCLUSION: Integrating multilevel radiomics with Transformer-derived deep learning features enhances prediction of RICAI after NPC radiotherapy and shows promise as a noninvasive risk-stratification tool.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis provides important insights into the prognostic capacity of the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in head and neck cancer, which could have clinical implications, although it is based on retrospective studies rather than a large prospective trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Almeida ND, Schrand TV, Sullivan D, Yu H, Yao S, Ma SJ, Koempel A, Blakaj D, Repasky EA, Brackett CM, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579653/'&gt;41579653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammation and immune evasion are linked to tumor progression. This cancer-related inflammatory response is reflected by a biomarker named the systemic inflammatory response (SIRI). SIRI is calculated by multiplying the peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte counts and dividing by the lymphocyte count is a biomarker that has shown prognostic capacity in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of SIRI data for head and neck cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis using a mixed-effects model was performed to estimate the overall effect size of prognostic capacity. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival and progression-free survival, with effect sizes measured as log hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data on overall survival revealed a pooled HR of 2.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). This indicates higher SIRI patients are at greater risk of mortality relative to lower SIRI patients. Additionally, 3 studies reported metrics on progression-free survival, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (1.72, 3.13) (p &lt; 0.0001). Minimal heterogeneity was observed for progression-free survival (I2 = 0%, p&lt; 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI portends worse overall survival. Since SIRI correlates to immune function and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity, these factors are among those most likely to be impacted by altered SIRI parameters.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a large retrospective analysis of over 1000 patients with carcinoma of the parotid gland, providing valuable insights into incidence and treatment outcomes, which may inform clinical practice, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings typical of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sandström K, Farnebo L, Hafström A, Westerborn A, Olin M, Hammerlid E, Hammarstedt-Nordenvall L, Gebre-Medhin M, Granström B, Andersson-Säll T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107863'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107863&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579652/'&gt;41579652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRO: Population-based studies predominantly focused on carcinoma of the parotid gland (CPG) are rare. The study aims were to analyze the incidence of CPG and to assess treatment outcomes in relation to histopathology, preoperative diagnosis and adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR), including 1,018 patients diagnosed with CPG between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence remained stable with a mean of 0.9 (range 0.65-1.08) cases per 100,000 person-years (ASR-Europe). Curative treatment was administered to 90 % of the patients, with a recurrence rate of 9 % within 3 years. The highest recurrence rates were observed in patients with salivary duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while patients with acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas had lower recurrence rates. For stage I-II tumors, the 5-year relative survival was unaffected by whether the malignant diagnosis was known preoperatively. Male sex, increasing age, stage III-IV disease, and a World Health Organization/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (WHO/ECOG) performance status 2-4 was independently associated with increased overall mortality risk, whereas the timing of adjuvant radiotherapy was not. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to establishing the incidence and treatment outcomes of CPG in Sweden and highlights the diverse histopathological diagnoses of these tumors. Notably, unknown malignancy at the time of surgery did not impact survival in early-stage disease, and the timing of postoperative radiotherapy was not associated with overall survival.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis includes a substantial sample size of 2641 pediatric patients and provides important insights into prognostic factors for differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma, which could influence clinical practice, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Canali L, Pace GM, Zimello C, Cerri L, Costantino A, Gaino F, Malvezzi L, Spriano G, Paderno A, Ferreli F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70180'&gt;10.1002/hed.70180&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41574652/'&gt;41574652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), multifocality, and lateral neck lymph node metastasis on survival outcomes for pediatric patients with differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

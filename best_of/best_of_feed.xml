      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This secondary analysis of a phase 3 randomized clinical trial published in JAMA Oncology evaluates the long-term survival benefits of a novel combination therapy for recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which has significant implications for treatment guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Huang Y, Sun D, Zhou H, Zhou T, Qu S, Li J, Hu C, Xu M, Li W, Shen L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245'&gt;10.1001/jamaoncol.2025.6245&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41609753/'&gt;41609753&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Programmed cell death 1 protein (PD-1) or programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy is the current standard first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (RM-NPC). However, the long-term survival benefits at the 5-year benchmark remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether adding camrelizumab to chemotherapy significantly improved 5-year overall survival (OS) as first-line treatment for RM-NPC, compared with chemotherapy alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The CAPTAIN-1st trial was a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial conducted at 28 hospitals in China. Between November 13, 2018, and November 29, 2019, patients with treatment-naive RM-NPC were enrolled. This secondary analysis of the CAPTAIN-1st trial was prespecified. Data analysis was conducted on June 1, 2025. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive camrelizumab or placebo in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin for 4 to 6 cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with camrelizumab or placebo until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or completion of 2 years of treatment. MAIN OUTCOME: The primary end point, progression-free survival per independent review committee, has been reported previously. Herein, the secondary end point of OS is reported as prespecified in the protocol. RESULTS: Among 263 randomized patients (134 in randomized to camrelizumab, 129 to placebo), baseline characteristics were generally balanced between groups, except for age. The mean (SD) age was 49 (11.25) years, and 218 patients (82.9%) were male individuals, 45 (17.1%) were female individuals. With a median survival follow-up of 63.5 (95% CI, 61.2-64.6) months for the camrelizumab group and 63.0 (95% CI, 60.8-64.6) months for the placebo group, 85 (63.4%) and 95 (73.6%) deaths occurred, respectively. Median OS was 34.5 months (95% CI, 29.4-45.7) with camrelizumab vs 26.6 months (95% CI, 19.8-33.5) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55-0.99; 2-sided P = .047). After adjusting for age imbalance, the HR was 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89; P = .01). The 5-year OS rates were 37.8% vs 24.2%, reflecting an absolute difference of 13.6% (95% CI, 2.4%-24.8%; P = .02) in favor of camrelizumab. The OS benefits were generally consistent across subgroups. In the camrelizumab group, patients who achieved rapid clearance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA had significantly longer OS compared with those without EBV DNA clearance (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.18-0.58; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, the addition of camrelizumab to chemotherapy produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful 5-year OS benefits compared with chemotherapy alone in the first-line treatment of RM-NPC. These findings provided the first 5-year evidence supporting the benefit of PD-1-based chemoimmunotherapy in this setting.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials addresses an important clinical question regarding the use of surgical drains in thyroid surgery, potentially influencing surgical practice, though it is published in a specialty journal rather than a top-tier one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Al-Taie DS, Mughal Z, Lotfallah A, Fussey J, Deutsch P, Warner G, Daultrey CR, Ayshford C, Gupta KK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-026-10015-3'&gt;10.1007/s00405-026-10015-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41622270/'&gt;41622270&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Thyroidectomy is a commonly performed procedure with potential complications such as haematoma and seroma, which can result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Surgical drains have traditionally been used to mitigate these risks, but their necessity is increasingly debated due to concerns over pain, infection, and prolonged hospitalisation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the benefits and risks of using surgical drains following thyroidectomy. This meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials aimed to compare postoperative surgical outcomes in adult patients undergoing thyroid surgery, managed with or without drains. DATA SOURCES: Five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid Medline, EMCARE, and CINAHL) were systematically searched in August 2025 for articles published between January 1995 and August 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes in patients undergoing thyroidectomy with and without drains were included. Of the initial 119 articles identified, 10 RCTs were included in the final analysis, representing 1,078 patients. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pooled proportions were calculated and transformed using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine method. The random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was then conducted using inverse variance weighting, with between-study variance (τ2) estimated via the DerSimonian and Laird method. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included haematoma and seroma rates; secondary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI), return-to-theatre (RTT), postoperative pain, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Pooled complication rates were: haematoma 1.6%, seroma 3.7%, SSI 2.5%, and RTT 0.2%. Drain use was not associated with significant differences in haematoma (p = 0.15), seroma (p = 0.64), or RTT (p = 0.22). However, SSI (4.2% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.01), LOS (mean difference [MD] = 1.2 days; p &lt; 0.0001), and pain (MD = 2.2; p = 0.001) were significantly higher in the drain group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Routine placement of drains after all types of thyroidectomies does not significantly decrease the rates of haematoma, seroma, or recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and is linked to higher rates of surgical site infection, pain, and length of stay. A selective, patient-specific approach to drain use is recommended.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective, single-center randomized controlled trial comparing a novel surgical technique for papillary thyroid carcinoma, which may have important implications for surgical practice, although the sample size is moderate and the study is limited to a single institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wu K, Wei X, Lu M, Wei X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70187'&gt;10.1002/hed.70187&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41612971/'&gt;41612971&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare the safety and surgical efficacy of endoscopic thyroidectomy by gasless unilateral axillary (ETGUA) with conventional open thyroidectomy in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). METHODS: This prospective, single-center, and randomized controlled trial included 196 patients with PTC who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the ETGUA group (n = 98) or the open thyroidectomy group (n = 98). Complications within 30 days, parathyroid function [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and serum calcium], and short-term oncological outcomes were observed. Secondary outcomes included operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative recovery, pain score, cosmetic satisfaction, and hospitalization cost. RESULTS: The ETGUA group had a significantly longer operative time than the open thyroidectomy group, less intraoperative blood loss, more postoperative drainage at postoperative day 1, as well as a shorter postoperative hospital stay (all p &lt; 0.05). At 1 year postoperatively, surgical efficacy and oncological indicators such as the number of lymph nodes dissected, number of positive lymph nodes, stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg) level, and the proportion of patients receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine therapy were comparable between groups (p &gt; 0.05). The ETGUA group reported lower visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and higher cosmetic satisfaction, though the total hospitalization cost was slightly higher (all p &lt; 0.05). The learning curve analysis indicated that operative time and intraoperative blood loss stabilized after approximately 30-40 cases. CONCLUSION: ETGUA demonstrates comparable safety and oncological efficacy to conventional open thyroidectomy in PTC patients.</description>

As immunotherapy has become the first-line treatment for HNSCC, resistance to anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) agents has emerged as a pivotal challenge. This prospective, single arm, phase II study (NCT05721443) evaluated the efficacy and safety of dalpiciclib, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, combined with cetuximab in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. Patients diagnosed with p16-negative R/M HNSCC resistant to first-line anti-PD-1 therapy without prior cetuximab treatment were enroled. Patients received oral dalpiciclib (150 mg daily on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle) and intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 on day 1 of cycle 1, followed by 250 mg/m2 weekly in each cycle). The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR), secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and safety. Between March 2023 and November 2024, a total of 28 patients were enroled. The ORR was 67.9% (19/28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 49.0%-82.0%), which met our primary endpoint. With a median follow-up of 9.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 5.98-14.12), the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 4.13- not reached [NR]), and the median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 10.75-23.25). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) occurred in all patients, predominantly grade 1-2. Grade 3 TRAEs included neutrophil count decreased (9/28, 32.1%) and white blood cell count decreased (9/28, 32.1%). No grade 4 or 5 TRAEs were observed. Dalpiciclib combined with cetuximab was well-tolerated and showed promising efficacy in patients with anti-PD-1-resistant, HPV-negative recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC.</description>

We profiled the genetic landscape of R/M HPV+ HNSCC, and functionally characterized genetic alterations strongly enriched in this cancer type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We identified genetic alterations uniquely enriched in 159 R/M HPV+ tumors. High-priority alterations were functionally modeled, examining proliferation, clonogenicity, migration/invasion, apoptosis, therapy response, in vivo growth, and metastasis, and immune contexture. RESULTS: Compared with HPV+ primary tumors, R/M HPV+ tumors were enriched for TP53 mutations (pre-specified FDR threshold met; OR 6.23; p=.02) and associated with poorer survival. Within R/M disease, CYLD alterations were specific to HPV+ tumors (21% vs 0% in HPV-). TP53 mutations were predominantly clonal and associated with whole genome duplication. Expression of TP53 GOF mutants (R175H, G245C, R273C) in HPV+ HNSCC cells increased clonogenic survival, migration/invasion, lung metastatic burden in vivo, and cisplatin IC50, without altering radiation sensitivity. CYLD knockdown accelerated cellular growth yet increased radiosensitivity. Transcriptomic analyses linked CYLD loss to NF-κB/TNF-α pathway activation, a T-cell-inflamed microenvironment, and checkpoint upregulation. CONCLUSIONS: R/M HPV+ HNSCC is genomically and functionally shaped by 2 axes with therapeutic implications: TP53 gain-of-function mutations promote metastatic phenotypes and cisplatin resistance, while CYLD loss defines an HPV-specific subset with enhanced radiation sensitivity and immune activation. These data support using TP53 and CYLD as predictive biomarkers to guide investigation into precision strategies for systemic therapy choices, p53-targeted/Wee1 strategies, and radiotherapy-immunotherapy combinations in high-risk or R/M HPV+ HNSCC.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN who progressed after platinum-based chemotherapy and/or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, including those with multiple lines of prior therapy, were administered intravenous becotatug vedotin at either 2.0 or 2.3 mg/kg every three weeks. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled (35 received 2.0 mg/kg and 32 received 2.3 mg/kg). The ORR was 20.9% (14/67, 95% confidence interval [CI], 11.9-32.6), with a median duration of response of 10.9 months (95% CI, 2.6-15.1). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months (95% CI, 1.8-3.9), and the median overall survival (OS) was 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.0-8.9). Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 91.0% (61/67) patients, most commonly being rash (26.9%), pruritus (25.4%), constipation (23.9%), and anemia (20.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Becotatug vedotin demonstrated promising antitumor activity with a manageable safety profile in previously heavilytreated R/M SCCHN, particularly the recommended dose of 2.3 mg/kg in patients who had failed platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (≤2 prior lines of therapy).</description>

Despite curative-intent therapy, 10% to 50% of patients experience recurrence. Prognosis for recurrent or metastatic disease is poor, with limited treatment options, underscoring the need for accurate prognostic models to guide treatment escalation or de-escalation and avoid over-treatment. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter prognostic study of patients undergoing curative-intent surgery at Samsung Medical Center and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary/Massachusetts General Hospital from 2008 to 2024. Baseline clinicopathologic variables were integrated with longitudinal laboratory measurements from surveillance. A random 80/20 split defined development and internal-validation cohorts. Using XGBoost, we trained two models to predict recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years from each visit. RESULTS: A total of 975 patients with HNSCC (oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal, and laryngeal subsites) were included. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for predicting 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year RFS from the surveillance time point were 0.785 (sensitivity, 72.8%; specificity, 71.5%), 0.831 (79.7%; 73.7%), 0.788 (74.0%; 73.3%), 0.769 (72.6%; 70.5%), and 0.795 (72.1%; 74.7%), respectively. For OS prediction, AUCs were 0.788 (72.1%; 73.6%), 0.797 (75.7%; 71.8%), 0.796 (81.0%; 68.4%), 0.820 (77.5%; 76.5%), and 0.815 (75.8%; 75.8%), respectively. In subgroup analysis, the model showed strong OS prediction in human papilloma virus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer, with AUCs of 0.943, 0.736, 0.699, 0.835, and 0.765 at 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-years, respectively. In non-HPV-positive HNSCC, OS AUCs ranged from 0.780 to 0.813 and RFS AUCs from 0.774 to 0.830 across the same time points. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this multicenter study, an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered model using multimodal and longitudinal data accurately predicted RFS and OS at multiple time points following curative-intent surgery for HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a large prospective study with 550 patients focusing on the optimal extent of lymph node dissection in papillary thyroid carcinoma, which addresses an important clinical question and has potential implications for surgical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang S, Cai H, Huang Z, Zhuge L, Wang Z, Liu W, Niu L, Yan D, Li Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70116'&gt;10.1002/hed.70116&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41588625/'&gt;41588625&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: There is much controversy on the extent of lymph node dissection (LND) for papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients with lymph node metastasis (LNM) according to major guidelines. This study aims to explore the optimal extent of LND and discover a personalized and accurate surgical plan for pN1 PTC patients. METHODS: This prospective study included 550 patients with PTC who underwent initial surgery. For patients who were considered pN1a, LND of levels III and IV was completed. For patients who were considered LNM in levels III or IV, after taking 3-6 lymph nodes of level III for frozen pathological examination, if LNM was found, LND of levels II-IV was performed; otherwise, only levels III and IV were dissected, For patients who were considered to have LNM in level II, LND of levels II-V was performed. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. RESULTS: 51.4% of patients with pN1a had postoperative pathologically confirmed occult LNM in levels III and IV. Among patients who underwent LND of levels II-IV due to positive lymph nodes in level III, 46.1% had occult LNM in level II. For patients with LNM in level II, the incidence of occult metastasis in level V was 20%. Only one patient presented with lymph node recurrence outside of the operative field. The proportion of patients with postoperative complications increased as the scope of dissection enlarged. CONCLUSION: Combined with the distribution of LNM and the number of subregions of LNM(n) in preoperative ultrasonography, it is suggested that the range of LND in the lateral neck of pN1 PTC should be n + 1/2 anatomical subregions.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study provides important insights into the immunosuppressive mechanisms associated with lymph node colonization in head and neck cancer, utilizing advanced methodologies like spatial proteomics and transcriptomics, which could have clinical implications, but it lacks the large sample size or randomized controlled trial design that would elevate its impact further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Haist M, Baertsch MA, Reticker-Flynn NE, Lu G, Kempchen TN, Chu P, Vazquez G, Chen H, Sunwoo JB, Zhang W, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer cell | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ccell.2026.01.003'&gt;10.1016/j.ccell.2026.01.003&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41616773/'&gt;41616773&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lymph node (LN) colonization in cancer is linked to poor prognosis. Evidence suggests that LN colonization induces systemic immunosuppression, facilitating distant metastasis. We investigated LN-mediated immunosuppression in patients with head-and-neck cancer using spatial proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, and an in vivo model of melanoma LN metastasis. Both primary tumors and paired LNs of nodal-positive patients exhibit enhanced interferon-γ signaling and an enrichment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). The spatial intersection of these myeloid-CAF-enriched niches with perifollicular T cell zones and LN follicles is linked to enhanced T cell dysfunction and Treg activation therein, thereby driving architectural LN remodeling. These immune suppressive changes extend to adjacent non-tumor-involved LN regions and nearby tumor-free LNs, but were not detected in LNs of non-cancer patients, reflecting a systemic effect that compromises anti-tumor immunity beyond the tumor-involved LN. Hence, our findings establish LN colonization as an active driver of systemic immunosuppression, facilitating metastatic progression.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 68/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis of 578 patients, revealing significant limitations in the sensitivity of US-FNAC for detecting occult nodal metastases in early-stage OSCC, which could influence clinical practice and diagnostic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Donders DNV, Tellman RS, Schouten SM, Dankbaar JW, Pameijer FA, Breimer GE, de Bree R, de Keizer B&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70183'&gt;10.1002/hed.70183&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-27&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41589568/'&gt;41589568&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (US-FNAC) is commonly used in the diagnostic work-up of head and neck cancer, but its ability to detect occult lymph node metastases in early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) with a clinically negative neck remains unclear. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 578 patients with early-stage OSCC (cT1-3N0) who underwent US-FNAC prior to surgery. Histopathology, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and follow-up were used as reference standards. RESULTS: Occult nodal metastases were found in 179 patients (31.0%). US-FNAC showed low sensitivity (15.9%) and a negative predictive value of 72.9%, resulting in 149 false-negative cases (25.8%). Specificity (99.5%) and positive predictive value (90.3%) were high, with only 2 false-positive results. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and a clinically negative neck, US-FNAC demonstrates high specificity but limited sensitivity and negative predictive value. These findings indicate that US-FNAC alone is insufficient to exclude occult nodal metastases and should be regarded as an adjunctive diagnostic tool rather than a stand-alone nodal staging strategy.</description>

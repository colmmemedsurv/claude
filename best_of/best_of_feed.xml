      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 82/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study includes a phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating a de-escalation strategy in a significant patient population with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, addressing an important clinical question regarding treatment toxicity and efficacy, which may influence future treatment guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lovett JT, Wotman MT, Westra WH, Ahn S, Gupta V, Bakst RL, Roof S, Miles BA, Genden E, Misiukiewicz K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564691/'&gt;41564691&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The rising incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) underscores the need for treatment strategies that maintain disease control while minimizing long-term toxicity. This study reports the long-term follow-up of de-escalation in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, providing critical data for future studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced HPV-OPC treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by reduced-dose chemoradiation (rdCRT). We hypothesized that de-escalated radiation therapy after IC would be non-inferior to standard-dose CRT (sdCRT). DESIGN: Two sequential clinical trials; Quarterback (QB) 1: phase III randomized control trial, QB 2: phase II non-randomized trial; patient accrual conducted between December 2012 and February 2022; final data cutoff April 2025. Median follow-up (IQR): 88.5 (64.6-118.2) months. SETTING: Single-institution academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients with HPV-OPC were screened. 47 patients received rdCRT after IC and were included in the primary analysis. Key eligibility: smoking history ≤20 pack-years, no active smoking, no distant metastases, molecularly confirmed HPV status. INTERVENTIONS: Three cycles of induction TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) followed by rdCRT (5600 cGy) with weekly carboplatin in clinical responders; non-responders in both QB trials and responders in the control arm of QB1 received sdCRT (7000 cGy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoints: 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary: overall survival (OS). Tertiary: disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Among 47 patients treated with rdCRT after IC, the 3-year and 5-year LRRFS were 89.3% and 86.6%. PFS was 87.2% and 84.6% at 3 and 5 years. OS was 91.5% and 89.1% at 3 and 5 years. Six patients (13%) experienced locoregional failure, and two (4%) developed distant metastases. 7/8 treatment failures (87.5%) occurred in patients with extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rdCRT following IC yields durable disease control in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, with outcomes comparable to historical benchmarks. Extended follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of this de-escalation strategy, even in patients with aggressive disease characteristics, but also underscores the need for careful patient selection, particularly in those with extracapsular extension.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter randomized phase II trial evaluates induction nivolumab before chemoradiation in a high-risk population, providing important insights into treatment feasibility and safety, though it is not a phase III trial and the sample size is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mirghani H, Aupérin A, Even C, Larive A, Fayette J, Geoffrois L, Clatot F, Calderon B, Tao Y, Nguyen F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00835'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00835&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570275/'&gt;41570275&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and advanced stage and/or significant smoking history are at higher risk of relapse. Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study evaluates a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in a significant patient population with locally advanced HPV-independent HNSCC, providing important insights into recurrence management, although it is not a randomized trial and the findings may require further validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruiz-Torres DA, Roberts TJ, Du P, Mendel J, Neagele S, Bonora G, Zhang F, Efthymiou V, Merkin RD, Lin DT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569592/'&gt;41569592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Recurrence rates for locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are high. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a large prospective population-based study evaluating the effectiveness of MRI versus endoscopy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma detection, which has important clinical implications for screening in high-risk populations, though it does not meet the criteria for a phase 3 trial or practice-changing findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhou HN, Li T, Peng YN, Li H, Wu ZC, Fan YY, King AD, Hildesheim A, Ling W, Liu Z, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70256'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41548058/'&gt;41548058&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) detection in screening remains unclear as a result of limited follow-up. METHODS: A prospective population-based screening study was conducted in Southern China from October 2014 to November 2018 among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals aged 30-69 years. EBV-seropositive participants underwent both endoscopy and MRI. Suspicious findings from either modality triggered a second endoscopy with biopsy. Followup for cancer diagnoses was completed via multiple methods in October 2023. Primary end points included the 5-year NPC detection rate (overall and by stage) and the false-negative rate. Secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and referral rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 814 individuals (455 females; 56%) with a median age of 53 years (interquartile range, 46-60 years). Thirty-two NPC cases were detected (30 via MRI; 21 via endoscopy) over 5 years. MRI showed a significantly higher overall NPC detection rate (36.9 [95% CI, 25.9-52.1] vs. 25.8 [95% CI, 16.9-39.1] per 1000; p = .007) and early-stage tumor detection (20.9 [95% CI, 13.1-27.1] vs. 12.3 [95% CI, 6.7-22.5] per 1000; p = .020) than endoscopy. MRI also demonstrated a lower false-negative rate (3.0 [95% CI, 0.8-11.0] vs. 14.9 [95% CI, 8.4-26.5] per 1000; p = .024) and higher sensitivity (93.8% vs. 65.6%; p = .007) but lower specificity (84.0% vs. 92.8%; p &lt; .001) and PPV (19.6% vs. 27.6%; p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Single MRI demonstrated superior NPC detection versus endoscopy, particularly for early-stage tumors, in high-risk populations during a 5-year period, which suggests the potential for extending the rescreening interval to 5 years for MRI-negative individuals.</description>

METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

However, the immunological mechanisms underlying chemoresistance remain undefined. Here, we perform longitudinal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiling of paired pre-/post-TPF HPSCC specimens, mapping immune cell dynamics underlying chemoresistance. Our study identifies ZNF683+ natural killer (NK) cells as a gatekeeper of chemotherapy efficacy through integrated single-cell transcriptomics, spatial multiplex immunohistochemistry and functional validation. Moreover, pretreatment baseline enrichment of ZNF683+ NK cells predicts TPF response, while GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells function as the predominant immunologic effector to successful TPF intervention. Mechanistically, bioinformatics and in vitro coculture data reveal that ZNF683+ NK cells directly interact with CD8+ T cells, and drive an MHC-I-dependent licensing of polyfunctional GZMK+CD8+ effector memory T cells. Collectively, this NK-CD8+ axis provides a potential predictive biomarker and therapeutic target to overcome chemoresistance in patients with HPSCC.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 8510 laryngoscopic images from 743 patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. A dual-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture was constructed, integrating multi-scale feature analysis with cross-attention fusion mechanisms. The model was rigorously evaluated through internal-external validation and a prospective reader study involving 12 endoscopists of varying expertise. RESULTS: The AI system demonstrated superior performance in three-tier classification, achieving F1-scores of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.869-0.896) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.844-0.878) for high-risk lesion identification in internal and external validation, respectively. AI assistance significantly improved junior endoscopists' sensitivity from 67.1% to 81.4% (P &lt; 0.001), effectively narrowing diagnostic performance disparities with senior experts. The system maintained robust generalizability across institutions, with 90.5% accuracy under heterogeneous imaging protocols. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI framework provides a clinically effective solution for reliable VCL risk stratification and reduces diagnostic variability between clinicians. Validated across multiple centers, this dual-scale ViT approach establishes a novel paradigm for laryngoscopic diagnosis and holds significant potential to standardize diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important epidemiological insights into changing incidence and survival trends of head and neck cancers in New Zealand, which could inform public health strategies, but it is a retrospective analysis with no immediate clinical application or practice-changing findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Win Myint TT, McIvor N, Douglas R, Cavadino A, Tin Tin S, Elwood M&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2026.102995&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-21&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570438/'&gt;41570438&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Cancers of the oral cavity, larynx, and hypopharynx have traditionally been associated with common risk factors such as tobacco and alcohol use. With changes in smoking and drinking patterns, the incidence of these cancers is expected to change. Although the incidence of oral cavity cancer has been reported recently, there is limited evidence available for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers in New Zealand (NZ). Furthermore, while growing evidence suggests increasing incidence of tongue cancer among females and young individuals, this trend has not been investigated in NZ. This study will therefore assess the incidence rates, trends in incidence, and survival of tongue, other oral cavity, laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. METHODS: The study included patients with a primary diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) oral tongue, other oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx, which were retrieved from the National Cancer Registry from 2006 to 2022. Directly age-standardised incidence rates were calculated, using the World Health Organisation standard population. Time trends were analysed with joinpoint regression to identify annual percentage changes (APCs), and overall and relative survival rates were estimated. RESULTS: The average annual incidence rate per 100,000 population was 1.2 for oral tongue SCC, 1.0 for other oral cavity SCC, 1.1 for laryngeal SCC, and 0.3 for hypopharyngeal SCC. Males consistently showed a higher incidence rate than females for all tumours except oral tongue SCC, where the incidence rates in older-aged females were higher than that of their male counterparts. Incidence rates differed by ethnicity, with Pasifika having higher incidence rates for oral tongue and other oral cavity SCC, and Māori for laryngeal and hypopharyngeal SCC, compared to European. Over the past 17 years, trends in incidence rates of laryngeal SCC declined significantly with 5 % per year overall and across all sexes, age groups and ethnic groups, whereas those of oral tongue, other oral cavity and hypopharyngeal SCC remained stable. Both overall and relative survival rates were highest for oral tongue SCC and lowest for hypopharyngeal SCC. The 5-year relative survival rates were 73 % for oral tongue SCC, 58 % for other oral cavity SCC, 67 % for laryngeal SCC and 42 % for hypopharyngeal SCC. In addition to age effects, survival outcomes varied by ethnicity, with notable disparity observed among Māori for other oral cavity and laryngeal SCC. CONCLUSION: This study confirms a consistent decline in laryngeal SCC incidence rates in New Zealand over the last 17 years. However, no such decline was observed for oral tongue, other oral cavity, and hypopharyngeal SCC. The findings suggest that the risk attributed by common risk factors such as smoking may vary between tumour sites and demographic groups, particularly for oral tongue SCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis of 3723 patients, developing a predictive model for cervical lymph node metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma, which has clinical implications but lacks prospective validation and is limited to a single center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang XH, Cao LM, Zhu ZQ, Xiao Y, Luo HY, Wang GR, Zhou K, Yu YF, Jia J, Liu B, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107860'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107860&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564692/'&gt;41564692&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cervical lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is the most critical prognostic factor in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). To facilitate individualized risk assessment, this study aimed to develop and internally validate a novel prediction model. We retrospectively analyzed 3723 patients with OSCC from a single center (2012-2023), with 2792 eligible patients randomly allocated to a training (n = 1954) and a validation set (n = 838). A rigorous variable selection process was employed, where predictors significant in univariable analysis were entered into a multivariable logistic regression model that utilized a stepwise forward and backward elimination procedure to identify the final set of predictors. Six factors were ultimately incorporated into the nomogram: clinical T stage, clinical N stage, histological grade, perineural invasion, time from onset to treatment, and alcohol consumption. The model demonstrated good discrimination in both training (AUC = 0.780) and validation (AUC = 0.744), excellent calibration, and clinical utility. In conclusion, this internally validated nomogram accurately predicts CLNM risk and can aid in tailoring neck management, pending external validation.</description>

Though it has been associated with treatment resistance and poor prognosis, increasing CIN above a maximally tolerated threshold leads to cell death because of loss of essential chromosomes. Because radiation causes CIN, we hypothesize that pre-existing CIN sensitizes tumor cells to radiation therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We induced mitotic defects that lead to CIN in FaDu (head and neck cancer, HNC) and HeLa (cervical) cells by knocking down or overexpressing the mitotic checkpoint protein mitotic arrest deficient 1 (Mad1), which induces lagging chromosomes. Radiation sensitivity was tested with clonogenic assays in vitro and tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts in vivo. MTT assays were used to determine the sensitivity of human papillomavirus (HPV) positive and HPV-negative HNC cells to docetaxel, and mitotic defects were quantified using immunofluorescence microscopy. Docetaxel-induced mitotic errors and tumor growth delay were evaluated in vivo. Six-chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to quantify CIN in a cohort of patients with laryngeal cancer treated with definitive radiation. RESULTS: Here, we show in two tissue contexts using engineered isogenic cancer cell lines that higher rates of chromosome missegregation sensitize to ionizing radiation, which itself induces mitotic errors. Consistent with this result, higher rates of anaphase defects in HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNC patient-derived xenograft tumors correlate with response to radiation. Moreover, laryngeal tumors with higher CIN before treatment tend to have an improved response to radiation therapy in the clinic. Furthermore, we show that docetaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing drug commonly used in combination with radiation, causes cell death and radiosensitizes cells by inducing abnormal multipolar spindles rather than causing mitotic arrest. CONCLUSIONS: These results mechanistically implicate CIN as an inducer of radiation response and provide evidence that increasing the rate of CIN is a rational method to enhance radiation sensitivity, which has significant implications for personalized therapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective study with a substantial sample size (n=210) that addresses a significant clinical challenge in risk stratification for papillary thyroid cancer using a novel non-invasive technique. The focus on preoperative assessment and the specific subgroup analysis for active surveillance versus therapy adds clinical relevance, though it may not be practice-changing on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jiang L, Li X, Ma T, Zeng P, Tan Z, Zheng C, Xu J, Zhang L, Guo Y, Liang J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2694'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2694&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41543346/'&gt;41543346&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Preoperative risk stratification for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a significant clinical challenge, as current systems primarily rely on postoperative pathology, limiting their utility for initial treatment planning. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a non-invasive liquid biopsy tool to stratify patient risk preoperatively. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study evaluating preoperative CTC levels in 210 patients diagnosed with PTC. A dual-threshold model was developed to analyze the diagnostic performance of CTC counts. The study particularly focused on the Papillary Thyroid Microcarcinoma (PTMC) subgroup (n=100) to address clinical uncertainty regarding active surveillance versus definitive therapy. Patients were monitored over a median follow-up period of 44 months to assess progression-free survival (PFS) and long-term prognostic outcomes. RESULTS: The dual-threshold model demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance. A cutoff of ≥ 2 CTCs effectively identified high-risk patients with 93.2% specificity and 88.2% positive predictive value (PPV). In the PTMC cohort, a CTC count &lt; 2 reliably identified low-risk patients suitable for active surveillance (NPV=94.0%), while a count ≥ 2 pinpointed those with high-risk features warranting surgery (Specificity=96.4%, PPV=80.0%). Prognostic analysis revealed that CTC-negative patients had improved PFS. This was most significant in the PTMC subgroup, where the CTC-negative cohort remained recurrence-free and showed significantly longer PFS compared to CTC-positive cases (HR=0.035, 95% CI: 0.002-0.726; P=0.030). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative CTC detection enables precise risk stratification for PTC patients. This liquid biopsy approach allows clinicians to personalize therapy-confidently selecting conservative management for low-risk individuals and recommending aggressive treatment for high-risk patients-thereby optimizing clinical decision-making and long-term outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This prospective population-based study evaluates the effectiveness of MRI versus endoscopy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma detection in a high-risk population, providing important insights that could influence screening practices, although it does not meet the threshold for practice-changing findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhou HN, Li T, Peng YN, Li H, Wu ZC, Fan YY, King AD, Hildesheim A, Ling W, Liu Z, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70256'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70256&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41548058/'&gt;41548058&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) detection in screening remains unclear as a result of limited follow-up. METHODS: A prospective population-based screening study was conducted in Southern China from October 2014 to November 2018 among Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-seropositive individuals aged 30-69 years. EBV-seropositive participants underwent both endoscopy and MRI. Suspicious findings from either modality triggered a second endoscopy with biopsy. Followup for cancer diagnoses was completed via multiple methods in October 2023. Primary end points included the 5-year NPC detection rate (overall and by stage) and the false-negative rate. Secondary end points were sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and referral rate. RESULTS: The analysis included 814 individuals (455 females; 56%) with a median age of 53 years (interquartile range, 46-60 years). Thirty-two NPC cases were detected (30 via MRI; 21 via endoscopy) over 5 years. MRI showed a significantly higher overall NPC detection rate (36.9 [95% CI, 25.9-52.1] vs. 25.8 [95% CI, 16.9-39.1] per 1000; p = .007) and early-stage tumor detection (20.9 [95% CI, 13.1-27.1] vs. 12.3 [95% CI, 6.7-22.5] per 1000; p = .020) than endoscopy. MRI also demonstrated a lower false-negative rate (3.0 [95% CI, 0.8-11.0] vs. 14.9 [95% CI, 8.4-26.5] per 1000; p = .024) and higher sensitivity (93.8% vs. 65.6%; p = .007) but lower specificity (84.0% vs. 92.8%; p &lt; .001) and PPV (19.6% vs. 27.6%; p = .019). CONCLUSIONS: Single MRI demonstrated superior NPC detection versus endoscopy, particularly for early-stage tumors, in high-risk populations during a 5-year period, which suggests the potential for extending the rescreening interval to 5 years for MRI-negative individuals.</description>

Comprehensive recurrence risk stratification remains lacking. Here, we profile 482 MTC samples from 452 patients across ten Chinese clinical centers, identifying 10,092 proteins and mutations in 87.0% of patients. Clinically, MTC grading, concurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma, and lymph node metastasis are significant recurrence risk factors, whereas at the genetic level, RET M918T and RET S891A mutations are correlated with high recurrence risk in sporadic and hereditary MTC, respectively. Ubiquitinomics show downregulated E3 ligases CUL4B and TRIM32 are associated with structural recurrence. We define three molecular subtypes with distinct outcomes and present an integrative machine learning model combining clinical, genomic, and proteomic features, validated in an independent test dataset of 105 patients and a published dataset. This multi-center, multi-omics study enhances the understanding of MTC heterogeneity and facilitates personalized patient management.</description>

We investigated grade as a prognostic determinant in OCC staging. METHODS: Multivariable Cox regression models of OCC patients identified via U.S. cancer registry data were constructed to determine associations between grade (G1 = low-grade, G2 = intermediate-grade, G3 = high-grade) and overall survival (OS). Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to derive staging schema. RESULTS: Overall, 46,789 OCC cases were identified across 1,222 institutions. On univariate analysis, higher grade was associated with worse 5-yr OS (G1: 73% [95% CI 72-74%], G2: 61% [95 CI 60-61%], G3: 49% [95% CI 48-51%] (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analysis adjusting for other prognostic factors, these survival differences persisted. Compared to G1 tumors, both G2 (HR 1.25 [95% CI 1.19-1.30], p &lt; 0.001) and G3 (HR 1.52 [95% CI 1.45-1.61], p &lt; 0.001) tumors were associated with significantly worse OS. Similar results were seen when utilizing propensity score matching. RPA generated subgroups that mirrored AJCC8E, but with G3 cases performing worse for a given stage. A proposed TNM + G staging schema was created with AJCC8E G3 cases upstaged by one category. Overall, 11.5% (4,745/36,623) cases were upstaged. TNM + G performed better than AJCC8E by c-index (0.673 vs. 0.671) and Brier score (0.174 vs. 0.175). CONCLUSION: Large-scale analysis supports grade as an influential predictive determinant in OCC outcomes, with hazard on par with conventional staging factors. Incorporation of grade into stage strengthens existing AJCC OCC schema and pragmatically improves its ability to convey prognosis.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large cohort (1348 patients) and provides important insights into the real-world outcomes of BRAF V600E-mutated papillary thyroid cancer, which could influence treatment decisions, though it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chirra M, Elliott A, Shaikh H, McGrath J, El-Gamal D, Karnezis AN, Abdulla FR, Ikpeazu C, Leddon J, Sukari A, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3932'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-3932&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41543354/'&gt;41543354&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Radioactive iodine refractory papillary thyroid cancers (PTC) containing BRAF-V600E mutations can be treated with BRAF/MEK inhibitors (BRAF/MEKi), but their effectiveness compared to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and immunotherapy (IO) remains unclear. Therefore, we compared real-world survival and molecular/transcriptional signatures in patients with BRAF-mut and BRAF-wildtype (wt) PTC. METHODS: Thyroid tumor samples underwent DNA/RNA next-gen sequencing and immunohistochemistry at Caris Life Sciences. Tumor microenvironment (TME) cell fractions were estimated by RNA deconvolution using QuanTIseq. Insurance claims data was used to infer real-world overall survival (OS) and time on treatment. RESULTS: A total of 1348 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer were identified; 81.8% were classified as PTC, of which 68.4% harbored a BRAF-V600E mutation. TERT promoter mutations were the most common mutation in PTC (72%), and more prevalent in BRAF-mut versus (vs) BRAF-wt. Mutations in NRAS, HRAS, and KRAS, as well as RET, BRAF, and ETV6 gene fusions, were predominantly found in BRAF-wt PTC. BRAF-mut PTC were more often PD-L1+ (33% vs. 18%, p&lt;0.001) and had significantly higher IFNγ scores. OS was not significantly different between patients with BRAF-mut vs wt PTC. Systemic treatment (BRAF/MEKi, TKI or IO) was not associated with significant differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC, although there was a trend for longer OS in those treated with TKI compared to BRAF/MEKi or IO. CONCLUSIONS: BRAF-mut PTC is associated with a pro-inflammatory TME milieu compared to BRAF-wt PTC. However, in this limited data set, treatment choice was not associated with differences in OS in BRAF-mut PTC.</description>

METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 8510 laryngoscopic images from 743 patients across three tertiary hospitals in China. A dual-scale Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture was constructed, integrating multi-scale feature analysis with cross-attention fusion mechanisms. The model was rigorously evaluated through internal-external validation and a prospective reader study involving 12 endoscopists of varying expertise. RESULTS: The AI system demonstrated superior performance in three-tier classification, achieving F1-scores of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.869-0.896) and 0.861 (95% CI: 0.844-0.878) for high-risk lesion identification in internal and external validation, respectively. AI assistance significantly improved junior endoscopists' sensitivity from 67.1% to 81.4% (P &lt; 0.001), effectively narrowing diagnostic performance disparities with senior experts. The system maintained robust generalizability across institutions, with 90.5% accuracy under heterogeneous imaging protocols. CONCLUSION: The proposed AI framework provides a clinically effective solution for reliable VCL risk stratification and reduces diagnostic variability between clinicians. Validated across multiple centers, this dual-scale ViT approach establishes a novel paradigm for laryngoscopic diagnosis and holds significant potential to standardize diagnostic workflows in resource-limited settings.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important insights into the timing of palliative care referrals in a comprehensive cancer center, addressing a critical clinical question, but it is a retrospective analysis with a moderate sample size and does not present novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Jerves FX, Chen M, Ellefson JC, Rozman de Moraes A, Haider A, Reddy A, Bruera E, Hui D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JCO oncology practice | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/OP-25-00441'&gt;10.1200/OP-25-00441&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-20&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41557969/'&gt;41557969&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Despite evidence supporting the benefits of early referral to palliative care (PC), many patients with advanced cancer continue to experience delayed referral or no referral at all. This study evaluated trends in outpatient PC consultation over 7 years at a comprehensive cancer center and identified predictors of timely referral to PC. METHODS: We randomly selected 700 patients seen at our outpatient supportive care center (100 per year, 2017-2023). Demographics, cancer diagnosis, symptom burden, date of outpatient PC consultation, and survival status were retrieved from their electronic medical records. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), defined as time from outpatient PC consultation to death or last follow-up. Timely referral to PC was defined as occurring ≥6 months before death or last follow-up from outpatient PC consultation. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models identified predictors associated with timely referral. RESULTS: Among 700 patients (median age 62 years, 54% female, 92% with advanced cancer), the median OS increased from 9.3 months in 2017 to 31.7 months in 2021 (P = .0001). The median follow-up for living individuals at the data cutoff was 19.1 months. The median number of PC visits increased from 3 to 7 between 2017 and 2023. Four hundred forty-nine (72%) patients received timely referral. In multivariable analysis, timely referral was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; P = .014), head and neck cancer (OR, 4.64; P &lt; .001), hematologic malignancies (OR, 3.31; P = .013), lower pain (OR, 0.9; P = .008), lower anorexia (OR, 0.88; P = .001), year of consultation (OR, 1.12; P = .038), and better performance status (OR, 0.70; P = .006). CONCLUSION: This study reveals a gradual and consistent shift toward earlier PC referral at a comprehensive cancer center, demonstrating that timely referral to PC with a follow-up of 30+ months is possible.</description>

Disparities in cancer care, including access to palliative care, for PWH contribute to poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and survival. However, limited research exists examining patient-reported HRQoL among PWH with cancer. We examined HRQoL among patients diagnosed with non-AIDS defining cancers with and without HIV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the 2007-2017 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (SEER-MHOS) linkage data to assess HRQoL among patients (ages ≥18) diagnosed with breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal, head and neck, lung, lymphoma, and prostate cancers. HRQoL outcomes included the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS) scores and the eight scale scores of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (VR-12), and the VR-6D health utility score. Higher HRQoL scores indicate better health status. Adjusting for patient characteristics, we computed mean HRQoL scores using multivariable linear regression models and the predictive margins method. The minimally important difference (MID) in HRQoL scores between patients with and without HIV by cancer types was assessed. RESULTS: The sample (N = 43,973) included 310 (0.7%) patients with HIV and had an average age at cancer diagnosis of 70.8 years. PWH reported lower scores in at least one HRQoL outcome compared to patients without HIV for all cancers examined. Differences in HRQoL for PWH compared to patients without HIV exceeded the MID for cancers of the breast (PCS: -2.7; MCS: -9.1; VR-6D: -0.08), colorectum (PCS: -2.3; MCS: -6.2; VR-6D: -0.06), gastrointestinal tract (MCS: -5.9; VR-6D: -0.04), head and neck (PCS: -4.1; MCS: -7.5; VR-6D: -0.07), lungs (PCS: -2.5; MCS: -6.3; VR-6D: -0.06), lymphatic system (PCS: -2.3; MCS: -2.6; VR-6D: -0.04), and prostate (MCS: -8.0; VR-6D: -0.07). DISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrated that PWH across all cancers examined reported substantially lower mental and/or physical HRQoL compared to patients without HIV. Future work can explore strategies for symptom monitoring and management among PWH.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This ecological study investigates a potential environmental risk factor for head and neck cancer using a large dataset from the SEER database, providing important epidemiological insights, although it lacks the rigor of a prospective design or direct clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Scussiatto HO, Patel EA, Stenson KM, Al-Khudari S, Jelinek MJ, Joshi N, Stubbs VC, Pinto JM, Bhayani MK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70128'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70128&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41553005/'&gt;41553005&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Heavy metals are established human carcinogens, and lead exposure via drinking water has been linked to esophageal cancer. This study aimed to investigate the association between various levels of lead exposure in drinking water and incidence rates of head and neck cancers (HNC) in the United States. STUDY DESIGN: Ecological study. SETTING: County-level data from 608 US counties included in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHODS: County-level HNC incidence rates and sociodemographic variables were obtained from SEER. Drinking water lead concentrations were sourced from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and spatially interpolated using inverse distance weighting (IDW). Tobacco and alcohol use data were retrieved from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Flexible semi-parametric regression models were used to assess the association between lead exposure and HNC incidence, adjusting for known confounders. Multiple comparisons were addressed using Holm's method, and sensitivity analyses were performed using ordinary least squares (OLS) models. RESULTS: Higher lead concentrations were significantly associated with increased incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancers (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P &lt; .01), gum and mouth cancers (IRR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.08, P = .02), and esophageal neoplasms (IRR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.03, P = .02). These associations remained significant after multiple testing correction and were consistent across OLS models. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to demonstrate that even low-level lead exposure below EPA limits in drinking water is associated with increased incidence of specific HNC subsites. These findings highlight the importance of continued investigation into environmental determinants of HNC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.</description>

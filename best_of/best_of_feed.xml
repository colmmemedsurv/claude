      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is a phase 3 randomized trial that explores the efficacy of avelumab in combination with chemoradiotherapy, identifying key tumor and microbiome features that influence treatment outcomes, which has significant implications for clinical practice in head and neck cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Riaz N, Alban TJ, Haddad RI, Saul M, Makarov V, Zhu Y, Cohen EEW, Ferris RL, Chang PM, Lin JC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0'&gt;10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482527/'&gt;41482527&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade-based multimodal therapy is widely used across oncology; yet drivers of resistance in most cancer types are not well understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized the tumor genome, microenvironment and microbiome in a phase 3 international randomized trial ( NCT02952586 ) to identify factors that shape outcomes to anti-PD-L1 avelumab plus standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy versus placebo/chemoradiotherapy in individuals with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients receiving avelumab whose tumors contained distinct immunologic and genetic features had superior outcomes compared to those receiving placebo. By contrast, patients with increased myeloid/neutrophil activities had worse outcomes with avelumab than those treated with placebo. Strikingly, these tumors possessed telltale intratumoral bacteria, elevated tumor-associated neutrophils, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and suppressed adaptive immunity. We define tumor ecosystems associated with benefit to chemoimmunotherapy. Our data demonstrate how intratumoral bacteria affect immune checkpoint blockade response within a randomized trial. These discoveries enhance our understanding of combination immunotherapy, provide a useful multiomic resource and identify unanticipated interactions that may guide future therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies intratumoral bacteria as a significant predictor of immunotherapy response in HNSCC, providing novel insights into treatment resistance, supported by data from a clinical trial and independent cohorts, which could influence future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Silver NL, Dai J, Kerr TD, Altemus J, Garg R, Simmons H, Alban T, Noel-Romas L, Makarov V, Shih DJH, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-025-01067-1'&gt;10.1038/s43018-025-01067-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482523/'&gt;41482523&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the promise of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), mediators of response are poorly understood. To address this, here we analyzed oropharyngeal HNSCCs treated with neoadjuvant durvalumab (anti-PDL1) alone or in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) from the CIAO clinical trial ( NCT03144778 ). We found that only the total abundance of intratumoral bacteria predicted ICB response, which was validated in multiple independent cohorts. High intratumoral bacteria abundance was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils coupled with depletion of T cells and other adaptive immune cells. Experimental elevation or reduction in intratumoral bacteria abundance in orthotopic models of HNSCC in female mice recapitulated immunological associations observed in participant tumors. Increasing intratumoral bacteria abundance was sufficient to induce resistance to anti-PDL1 ICB, irrespective of bacterial species tested. Together, these findings demonstrate that high intratumoral bacteria abundance is a key suppressor of antitumor immunity and promotes immunotherapy resistance.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large validation of a risk nomogram for predicting central lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, which has clinical implications for management strategies, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhang W, Wu X, Wang Y, Le Q, Xie Y, Yu K&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107842'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107842&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478265/'&gt;41478265&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The global incidence of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) continues to rise, and the optimal management strategy remains controversial due to its generally favorable prognosis. Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) is an important predictor of recurrence and survival and therefore plays a critical role in guiding therapeutic decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate a nomogram to preoperatively predict the risk of CLNM in PTMC patients. METHODS: Patients from ward A (n = 877) were assigned to the training cohort, and those from ward B (n = 637) formed the validation cohort. Clinical characteristics and ultrasonographic variables were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of CLNM, which were subsequently incorporated into a predictive nomogram. Model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified gender, age, maximum tumor diameter (MTD), multifocality, calcification and capsule status as significantly associated with CLNM (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed gender, age, MTD, multifocality, and capsule status as independent predictors. The nomogram demonstrated good discriminative ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.724 in the training cohort and 0.708 in the validation cohort. Calibration curves showed excellent agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, and DCA confirmed favorable clinical utility. CONCLUSION: We successfully developed and validated a clinically applicable nomogram that integrates preoperative clinical and ultrasonographic features to predict CLNM in PTMC patients. This model may assist clinicians in tailoring surgical strategies and optimizing individualized management.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective cohort of 5,671 patients, providing novel insights into the prognostic factors of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, which could have significant clinical implications, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu PT, Chiang CJ, Yang YW, Lee WC, Hsu WL, Chen TI, Lee HL, Wang CP, Liao LJ, Wang CC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41492174/'&gt;41492174&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing worldwide, with a well-established link to human papillomavirus (HPV). However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to November 28, 2024, was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang using the PICOS strategy. The primary outcome was mouth opening distance. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and methodological quality using the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0) and ROBINS-I. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024613003). RESULTS: The review included 15 articles, including eight randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-experimental studies. There were variations in the timing and type of rehabilitation. Most interventions started 2-3 weeks post-surgery. Three types of interventions, including exercise training, physical therapy, and speech training, improved trismus. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation interventions are often used in combination, but the effectiveness of individual interventions remains unclear. Physical therapy has been shown to alleviate pain, while remote reminders can enhance adherence. Only a basic consensus on rehabilitation interventions can be summarized due to design differences. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous trials to provide more conclusive evidence.</description>

This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence models in classifying salivary gland tumors on ultrasound. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of CINAHL, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted through January 28, 2025. REVIEW METHODS: Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence in classifying salivary gland tumors were included for fixed and random-effects meta-analyses. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool for systematic reviews of diagnostic accuracy studies was used to assess study quality and risk of bias. RESULTS: Out of 741 articles identified, 12 studies (N = 4721) met inclusion criteria. Nine studies evaluated artificial intelligence models differentiating benign from malignant tumors, and three studies assessed classification of pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors. For benign versus malignant tumors, sensitivity was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86, 0.95), specificity was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80, 0.92), and accuracy was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.90). For pleomorphic adenomas versus Warthin tumors, sensitivity was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.89), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81, 0.95), and accuracy was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence models demonstrate strong diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound-based classification of salivary gland tumors. These results highlight the potential of artificial intelligence as a diagnostic tool, though broader validation is needed before routine clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter retrospective study with a large sample size of 760 patients provides important insights into intratumoral heterogeneity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, potentially enhancing risk stratification, but lacks the definitive evidence or practice-changing findings characteristic of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Niu S, Ding J, Chen H, Zhu Z, Liao X, Hong H, Chen C, Dong J, Fei Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107845'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107845&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481965/'&gt;41481965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based framework for quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using three-dimensional tumor subregions. The goal was to enhance conventional clinical risk stratification and investigate the biological basis of ITH. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included PET scans from 760 treatment-naïve NPC patients. Radiomics features were extracted from the whole tumor (WT), and the intratumoral spatial diversity score (ITSDS) was simultaneously quantified through subregion analysis. After a multi-step feature selection process, both WT and ITH models were developed. Finally, a nomogram was constructed by integrating ITSDS with clinical factors. All models were evaluated using the C-index, AUC, and calibration curves, and their performance was interpreted using SHAP. Additionally, the biological characteristics of the ITH model were analyzed using tissue proteomics. RESULTS: The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts included 480, 235, and 45 patients, respectively. The ITH model showed superior C-indexes of 0.852, 0.792, and 0.757 compared to the clinical and WT models. The nomogram demonstrated the best prognostic value, with C-indexes of 0.864, 0.817, and 0.772 in the three cohorts, respectively. The nomogram effectively classified patients into risk groups for progression-free survival (P &lt; 0.01). Tissue proteomic analysis revealed upregulated ciliary movement, a more complex tumor microenvironment, and impaired immune function in the high-ITH group. CONCLUSION: The nomogram integrating ITSDS biomarkers with clinical factors improved risk stratification accuracy and created a clinically translatable framework for NPC. This approach potentially offers mechanistic insights into ITH and holds promise for advancing precision oncology.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized phase II trial with a focus on quality of life in HNSCC patients, which is important but does not yet demonstrate practice-changing findings or significant survival benefits. The sample size is moderate and the study addresses an important clinical question regarding supportive care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xiao G, Ning L, Chen L, Zhang S, Chen Y, Chen Y&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107844'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107844&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-31&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41478264/'&gt;41478264&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) significantly impairs patients' quality of life (QoL). While neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy offers potential survival benefits, it is associated with substantial treatment-related toxicities, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, and functional decline. Exercise therapy has shown promise in improving QoL in other cancers, but its role in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy remains underexplored. METHODS: This single-center, open-label, randomized phase II trial enrolled 114 HNSCC patients undergoing neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Participants were randomized 1:1 to an exercise group (personalized breathing and aerobic exercise program) or a control group (routine care). Outcomes were assessed using the BFI-C, EORTC QLQ-C30, QLQ-H&amp;N35, and PSQI at baseline, after 2 cycles, and after 3 cycles of therapy. RESULTS: The exercise group demonstrated significantly lower fatigue scores (BFI) after 2 and 3 cycles compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05). Sleep quality (PSQI) improved significantly in the exercise group and worsened in the control group. The exercise group also showed better outcomes in physical functioning, fatigue and insomnia. CONCLUSION: Exercise therapy is feasible and effective in reducing fatigue and improving sleep quality in HNSCC patients receiving neoadjuvant immuno-chemotherapy. Early integration of exercise may mitigate treatment-related symptoms and improve tolerance and overall QoL.</description>

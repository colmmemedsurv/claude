      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is based on a phase 3 international randomized trial and identifies key tumor and microbiome features that influence treatment outcomes with avelumab, providing important insights that could lead to practice-changing implications in head and neck cancer management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Riaz N, Alban TJ, Haddad RI, Saul M, Makarov V, Zhu Y, Cohen EEW, Ferris RL, Chang PM, Lin JC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0'&gt;10.1038/s43018-025-01068-0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482527/'&gt;41482527&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Immune checkpoint blockade-based multimodal therapy is widely used across oncology; yet drivers of resistance in most cancer types are not well understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized the tumor genome, microenvironment and microbiome in a phase 3 international randomized trial ( NCT02952586 ) to identify factors that shape outcomes to anti-PD-L1 avelumab plus standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy versus placebo/chemoradiotherapy in individuals with locally advanced head and neck cancer. Patients receiving avelumab whose tumors contained distinct immunologic and genetic features had superior outcomes compared to those receiving placebo. By contrast, patients with increased myeloid/neutrophil activities had worse outcomes with avelumab than those treated with placebo. Strikingly, these tumors possessed telltale intratumoral bacteria, elevated tumor-associated neutrophils, high systemic neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and suppressed adaptive immunity. We define tumor ecosystems associated with benefit to chemoimmunotherapy. Our data demonstrate how intratumoral bacteria affect immune checkpoint blockade response within a randomized trial. These discoveries enhance our understanding of combination immunotherapy, provide a useful multiomic resource and identify unanticipated interactions that may guide future therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This prospective matched cohort study compares two radiotherapy techniques in a sizable group of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, providing important insights into auditory preservation, which has clinical implications for treatment choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lien KH, Lin CY, Chen PY, Chang JT, Chen TY, Hung SP, Lee CH, Yap WK, Hsieh CE, Hsu CL, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70113'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503873/'&gt;41503873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare cochlear dose and hearing outcomes between intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies intratumoral bacteria as a significant predictor of immunotherapy response in HNSCC, providing novel insights into treatment resistance, backed by a substantial clinical trial analysis. While it does not constitute a phase 3 trial or direct practice-changing findings, its implications for understanding immunotherapy efficacy are noteworthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Silver NL, Dai J, Kerr TD, Altemus J, Garg R, Simmons H, Alban T, Noel-Romas L, Makarov V, Shih DJH, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s43018-025-01067-1'&gt;10.1038/s43018-025-01067-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-02&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41482523/'&gt;41482523&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the promise of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), mediators of response are poorly understood. To address this, here we analyzed oropharyngeal HNSCCs treated with neoadjuvant durvalumab (anti-PDL1) alone or in combination with tremelimumab (anti-CTLA4) from the CIAO clinical trial ( NCT03144778 ). We found that only the total abundance of intratumoral bacteria predicted ICB response, which was validated in multiple independent cohorts. High intratumoral bacteria abundance was associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, characterized by an accumulation of neutrophils coupled with depletion of T cells and other adaptive immune cells. Experimental elevation or reduction in intratumoral bacteria abundance in orthotopic models of HNSCC in female mice recapitulated immunological associations observed in participant tumors. Increasing intratumoral bacteria abundance was sufficient to induce resistance to anti-PDL1 ICB, irrespective of bacterial species tested. Together, these findings demonstrate that high intratumoral bacteria abundance is a key suppressor of antitumor immunity and promotes immunotherapy resistance.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 72/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter retrospective study with a large sample size of 760 patients provides important insights into intratumoral heterogeneity in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, potentially enhancing risk stratification, but it lacks the definitive evidence of practice-changing findings typically associated with higher impact scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Niu S, Ding J, Chen H, Zhu Z, Liao X, Hong H, Chen C, Dong J, Fei Z&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107845'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2025.107845&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41481965/'&gt;41481965&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: This study aimed to develop a radiomics-based framework for quantifying intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) using three-dimensional tumor subregions. The goal was to enhance conventional clinical risk stratification and investigate the biological basis of ITH. METHODS: This multicenter retrospective study included PET scans from 760 treatment-naïve NPC patients. Radiomics features were extracted from the whole tumor (WT), and the intratumoral spatial diversity score (ITSDS) was simultaneously quantified through subregion analysis. After a multi-step feature selection process, both WT and ITH models were developed. Finally, a nomogram was constructed by integrating ITSDS with clinical factors. All models were evaluated using the C-index, AUC, and calibration curves, and their performance was interpreted using SHAP. Additionally, the biological characteristics of the ITH model were analyzed using tissue proteomics. RESULTS: The training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts included 480, 235, and 45 patients, respectively. The ITH model showed superior C-indexes of 0.852, 0.792, and 0.757 compared to the clinical and WT models. The nomogram demonstrated the best prognostic value, with C-indexes of 0.864, 0.817, and 0.772 in the three cohorts, respectively. The nomogram effectively classified patients into risk groups for progression-free survival (P &lt; 0.01). Tissue proteomic analysis revealed upregulated ciliary movement, a more complex tumor microenvironment, and impaired immune function in the high-ITH group. CONCLUSION: The nomogram integrating ITSDS biomarkers with clinical factors improved risk stratification accuracy and created a clinically translatable framework for NPC. This approach potentially offers mechanistic insights into ITH and holds promise for advancing precision oncology.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset from the National Cancer Database and provides important insights into the survival outcomes of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, which could influence treatment strategies, though it is a retrospective analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Oliver JR, Wang NC, Alapati R, Attwood E, Amanian A, Bur AM, Beahm DD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70156'&gt;10.1002/hed.70156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503790/'&gt;41503790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) is associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared to similarly staged HPV-negative SNSCC. However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective cohort of 5,671 patients, providing important insights into the prognostic factors of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer in a specific population, which could influence clinical practice, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu PT, Chiang CJ, Yang YW, Lee WC, Hsu WL, Chen TI, Lee HL, Wang CP, Liao LJ, Wang CC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41492174/'&gt;41492174&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing worldwide, with a well-established link to human papillomavirus (HPV). However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review includes multiple randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, providing important insights into rehabilitation interventions for trismus in oral cancer patients, which has clinical implications for improving patient quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang H, An Y, Liu D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral diseases | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.70185'&gt;10.1111/odi.70185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41486431/'&gt;41486431&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate rehabilitation interventions for oral cancer patients with trismus and clarify effects on trismus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to November 28, 2024, was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang using the PICOS strategy. The primary outcome was mouth opening distance. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and methodological quality using the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0) and ROBINS-I. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024613003). RESULTS: The review included 15 articles, including eight randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-experimental studies. There were variations in the timing and type of rehabilitation. Most interventions started 2-3 weeks post-surgery. Three types of interventions, including exercise training, physical therapy, and speech training, improved trismus. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation interventions are often used in combination, but the effectiveness of individual interventions remains unclear. Physical therapy has been shown to alleviate pain, while remote reminders can enhance adherence. Only a basic consensus on rehabilitation interventions can be summarized due to design differences. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous trials to provide more conclusive evidence.</description>

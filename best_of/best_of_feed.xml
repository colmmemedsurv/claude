      <description>&lt;h3&gt;🔥 CRITICAL - Score: 90/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter, randomized phase 3 trial presents definitive evidence comparing lobaplatin and fluorouracil to cisplatin and fluorouracil in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with long-term survival data that could influence treatment guidelines and improve patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao X, Zhou JY, Huang HY, Guo L, Huang YY, Qiu WZ, Lin ZC, Cao KJ, Mo HY, Li XM, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature communications | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69315-1'&gt;10.1038/s41467-026-69315-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-10&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41667463/'&gt;41667463&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, cisplatin is known to be associated with poor treatment compliance and notable side effects. More effective and safer platinum drugs are needed for the treatment of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 2021, our multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial reported that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus concurrent chemoradiotherapy resulted in non-inferior survival and fewer toxic effects than did cisplatin-based therapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Data from the 10-year survival analysis are updated here. With a median follow-up of 10.6 years in the intention-to-treat population, 10-year progression-free survival is 70.7% in the lobaplatin-based therapy group vs. 71.9% in the cisplatin-based therapy group (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.72-1.43; log-rank p = 0.885). The difference between the groups is 1.2% (95% CI -6.7-9.1, pnon-inferiority = 0.015), which is lower than the prespecified non-inferiority margin of 10%. The results are similar when we analyze patients in the per-protocol population. In the univariable and multivariable analyses, stage is an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (p = 0.001). The subgroup analyses suggest that the non-inferiority of lobaplatin-based therapy did not differ among specific populations. The incidence of late toxic effects is similar between the therapy groups, except for grades 1-2 peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.033), grades 1-2 deafness/otitis (p = 0.021), and grades 1-2/3 nephrotoxicity (p = 0.005; p = 0.021), the incidence of which is greater in the cisplatin-based therapy group than in the lobaplatin-based therapy group. Our findings suggest that lobaplatin and fluorouracil induction chemotherapy plus lobaplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an alternative doublet treatment strategy to cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.</description>

DESIGN: Multicentre, randomised, open label, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Seven hospitals in China between 18 August 2020 and 21 June 2022. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 18-70 years with newly diagnosed high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after three cycles of induction chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (stage 4a, stage 2-3 with stable or progressive disease, or detectable Epstein-Barr virus DNA). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive combination chemoradiotherapy based on cisplatin (standard treatment group) or standard treatment with 19 cycles of intravenous camrelizumab (200 mg) once every three weeks (radiotherapy plus two concurrent cycles and 17 adjuvant cycles; camrelizumab group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat group was progression-free survival, defined as the time from randomisation to disease recurrence (locoregional or distant) or death from any cause. Secondary endpoints included safety and overall survival. RESULTS: 390 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the camrelizumab group (n=194) or the standard treatment group (n=196). At median follow-up of 39.9 months (interquartile range 36.8-43.4 months), progression-free survival was higher in the camrelizumab group than the standard treatment group (36 months: 83.4%, 95% confidence interval 78.3% to 88.8% v 71.3%, 65.2% to 77.9%; stratified hazard ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.77, P=0.001). The incidence of acute and late adverse events (grade 3 or 4) was 50.5% and 3.2% in the camrelizumab group compared with 48.7% and 3.7% in the standard treatment group. Immunological adverse events (grade 3 or 4) occurred in 19 patients (10.2%) in the camrelizumab group. CONCLUSION: The addition of camrelizumab to concurrent chemoradiotherapy and as a maintenance treatment improved progression-free survival among patients with high risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma after induction chemotherapy.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study identifies a novel mechanism linking androgen receptor signaling to CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction in HNSCC, with potential clinical implications for androgen deprivation therapy, indicating moderate impact on understanding disease biology and treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang Q, Tan Z, Zheng C, Xu J, Li Q, Hong S, Yu D, Hu X, Wang J, Jiang L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2384'&gt;10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2384&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41661680/'&gt;41661680&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits a distinct sex disparity in incidence, with a higher incidence in males than females. Recent studies have suggested that this difference persists even after accounting for smoking and alcohol use, highlighting the need to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that sex differences in HNSCC are androgen-dependent and identified androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and function. Mechanically, early growth response 4 (EGR4) functioned as a direct downstream transcriptional effector of AR that induced CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction. Clinically, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was an effective therapeutic strategy in HNSCC, suppressing tumor growth in mice while improving intratumoral CD8⁺ T cell function. Moreover, combining ADT with immune checkpoint inhibitors led to improved antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal ADT as a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the antitumor activity of sex-biased CD8⁺ T cells in HNSCC, which could inform the development of sex-biased immunotherapies for treating HNSCC patients.</description>

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based regimens, received paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 every 21 days plus weekly cetuximab (C) 250 mg/m2 for up to six cycles, followed by C maintenance. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best overall response (BoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age 64 years). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had a primary tumor in the oropharynx, 17 (29.8%) in the oral cavity, 9 (15.8%) in the hypopharynx, and 6 (10.5%) in the larynx. The ORR was 43.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7% to 57.6%], the BoR was 47.4% (95% CI 34.0% to 61.0%) with nine (15.8%) complete responses, and the DCR was 71.9% (95% CI 58.5% to 83.0%). DoR was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.1 months-not reached). Median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI 5.5-8.4 months) and 12.2 months (95% CI 10.5-17.6 months), respectively. Six-month PFS and OS rates were 49.0% and 73.0%, respectively. The most frequent non-hematological treatment-related adverse events were C-associated skin rash (78.9%) and PTX-related polyneuropathy (35.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective trial specifically evaluating PTX plus C after failure of first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with R/M SCCHN. The observed clinical activity and tolerability support this widely available regimen as a potential standard-of-care option in the absence of randomized evidence in this setting.</description>

We aim to explore the effect of tobacco cessation on the risk of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC). A case-control study was conducted across five cancer centres in India. We enrolled 2320 BMC and 2302 frequency-matched controls. Information was collected on smoking and chewing (products, duration and quitting). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of tobacco cessation compared to current users, after adjusting for potential confounders. For both smoking and chewing, the odds reduced rapidly after 5 years of quitting, so that those who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago had only 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.54) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to smoke, and those who quit chewing ≥10 years ago had 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to chew. Chewing with areca nut was associated with almost double the risk of chewing without (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.53-2.26) but the rate of reduction of risk with quitting was similar. These findings show clearly the benefits of quitting and inform policies that emphasize chewing tobacco cessation, given its widespread prevalence in India.</description>

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the survival impact of ENE in HNSCC and identified global research trends relevant to this research field through a complementary bibliometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus were systematically searched during 2000-2025. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Biblioshiny package of R to identify and map the publication trends, influential authors, and major institutional contributions between 2010 and 2025. RESULTS: Of the 839 retrieved records, 711 studies were screened, and 16 studies comprising approximately 3900 patients met all inclusion criteria. The bibliometric analysis of 120 Scopus-indexed publications demonstrated a marked increase in ENE-related research from 2015 onward, driven primarily by institutions in Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea. Keyword mapping indicated expanding intersections of ENE research with radiomics, prognostic modelling, and refinement of staging systems. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant association between ENE and adverse survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed consistently poor prognostic implications across both pathologic and radiologic ENE assessments. CONCLUSION: ENE in cervical lymph node metastases is an independent and strong predictor of adverse survival in HNSCC. The increasing global attention to ENE highlights its crucial role in multidisciplinary oncologic management. Therefore, standardized pathological and imaging-based assessment of ENE is essential for developing superior prognostic models and optimizing future treatment planning strategies.</description>

The purpose of this study is to perform the first meta-analysis examining intraoperative margin assessment methods in OCSCC with the goal of determining if there is a significant difference in patient outcomes between specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Studies met inclusion criteria if they conducted intraoperative specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis in patients with OCSCC and reported patient outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze the compiled data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 1988 articles for initial review of which 9 (1240 participants) met criteria for inclusion and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that a specimen-based approach is associated with higher intraoperative re-resection rate (P &lt; .05), significantly lower final positive margin rate (P &lt; .05), and decreased local recurrence when compared to the tumor bed-based approach (P &lt; .05). However, there was no significant difference in overall recurrence when comparing intraoperative margin analysis methods (P &gt; .05). Additionally, none of the included studies noted a significant difference in survival outcomes between tumor bed versus specimen-based methods. CONCLUSION: Specimen-based frozen margin analysis in OCSCC results in lower false negative rates and improved local control; however, there is no significant difference in overall recurrence or survival when comparing specimen-based vs tumor bed-based techniques.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding the safety of thyroidectomy in older adults, with potential implications for patient counseling and risk assessment, though it does not present novel therapeutic findings or practice-changing results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ghani A, Ayesh AR, Rajaram H, Ganegoda SM, Alogakos M, Sato A, Hage K, Than CA, Nakanishi H, Shin J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.5345&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642589/'&gt;41642589&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: A greater proportion of older patients (age ≥65 years) are undergoing thyroidectomy amidst an aging population. Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance. These findings support individualized counseling and perioperative planning while acknowledging the overall safety of thyroidectomy in this population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter retrospective analysis of 1374 patients provides important insights into the prognostic significance of the Worst Pattern of Invasion in oral squamous cell carcinoma, potentially influencing clinical practice, although it lacks the rigor of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Roy P, Weber MB, Gupta R, Kakkar A, Fonseca D, Bal M, Kamboj M, Anand N, Anila KR, Velusamy S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107874'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107874&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-03&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41638055/'&gt;41638055&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) has been evaluated in many single-institute cohorts. Our goal was to perform a large multicentre evaluation of WPOI as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective pathology data was collated from 14 institutions and compared with clinical outcome in 1374 OSCC patients with upfront curative resection. Most cases were of oral tongue (n = 645, 47%); T2 (33%) and N0 (59%). WPOI 1-3 frequency was 29.4%, WPOI 4 47% and WPOI 5 22%. On univariable analysis, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) was 54.2% for WPOI 5 vs. 69.7% for WPOI 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001). The locoregional control (LRC) was 68.9% vs 79.2% (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) 68.4% vs 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression in the entire cohort, WPOI 4 or 5 was strongly correlated with other known poor prognostic factors and not an independent predictor of OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.52), LRC or DFS. However, in early-stage (pT1-2 N0) patients treated with surgery alone without adjuvant radiotherapy, WPOI 5 was a robust independent predictor of DFS (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.54-12.32, p = 0.006), OS (HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.1, p = 0.020) and LRC (HR 3.52, 95% CI 2.13-5.82, p &lt;0.001) after applying inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. Furthermore, in the entire cohort of early-stage patients, interaction modeling showed that adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces the risk for both DFS and LRC for those with WPOI-5 (Interaction p = 0.002). Therefore, it may act as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. The prognostic and predictive role of WPOI-5 should be validated in prospective trials.</description>

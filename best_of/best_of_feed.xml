      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized Phase II/III trial evaluating a novel combination therapy in a significant patient population with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, which has the potential for practice-changing implications based on its design and primary endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rischin D, Hansen AR, Cohen EEW, Tahara M, Harrington KJ, Haddad RI, Licitra L, Mehanna H, Ferris RL, Koralewski P, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41427951/'&gt;41427951&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Feladilimab, an inducible T-cell co‑stimulatory receptor agonist, demonstrated clinical activity in combination with pembrolizumab in a Phase I head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) expansion cohort, prompting further evaluation in patients in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective analysis of over 1,700 patients and introduces an innovative AI-based approach to assess extranodal extension in oropharyngeal carcinoma, which could have significant clinical implications for risk stratification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ye Z, Mojahed-Yazdi R, Zapaishchykova A, Tak D, Mahootiha M, Pardo JCC, Zielke J, Zha Y, Guthier C, Tishler RB, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-24-02679'&gt;10.1200/JCO-24-02679&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41435207/'&gt;41435207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Extranodal extension (ENE) is a biomarker in oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) but can only be diagnosed via surgical pathology. We applied an automated artificial intelligence (AI) imaging platform integrating lymph node autosegmentation with ENE prediction to determine the prognostic value of the number of predicted ENE nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multisite, retrospective study of 1,733 OPC patients with pretreatment computed tomography who underwent definitive radiation therapy across three institutions. Malignant lymph nodes were segmented using a validated deep learning auto-segmentation model, and segmented lymph nodes were sequentially processed with a validated ENE prediction model to calculate number of nodes with AI-predicted ENE (AI-ENE) per patient. We evaluated associations of AI-ENE with disease outcomes using site-stratified, multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for human papillomavirus (HPV) status, smoking pack-years, tumor and nodal stage, age, and sex. We evaluated risk-stratification improvement when incorporating AI-ENE into the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 risk groupings and derived American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging with Uno C-indices and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: Overall, median AI-ENE node number was 1 (range, 0-6). AI-ENE node number was independently associated with poorer distant control (DC; hazard ratio [HR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.69]; P &lt; .001) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.46]; P &lt; .001). Increasing AI-ENE node number was incrementally associated with worse outcome, particularly DC (P &lt; .001). C-indices improved in the external data set when incorporating AI-ENE into RTOG-0129 groupings (OS: 0.70 v 0.65; DC: 0.65 v 0.57) and AJCC-8 stage (OS: 0.75 v 0.70; DC: 0.72 v 0.67; P &lt; .001 for each). The largest improvements were observed among HPV-negative patients (C-index: +15% for OS, +14% for DC). CONCLUSION: Automated, AI-ENE node number is a novel risk factor for OPC that may better inform pretreatment risk stratification and decision-making.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis includes a substantial number of studies and patients (2,313), providing important insights into the efficacy of Mepitel film for treating radiodermatitis, which is clinically relevant for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ren X, Wang H, Liu J, Yuan Y, Wu T, Zhang H, Yang D, Yan Y, Xu Y, Wei F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15465-2'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15465-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41420160/'&gt;41420160&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of Mepitel film on the prevention and treatment of radiodermatitis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, and SinoMed Database, from their inception until August 6, 2024. We identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials that assessed the effects of Mepitel film on radiodermatitis. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool for randomized trials (RoB2). Traditional meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and Stata 14.0 software. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies involving 2,313 cancer patients were included. The pooled analysis indicated that Mepitel significantly reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis (OR = 0.28, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.50, I2 = 67%, P &lt; 0.0001) compared to the control groups. In the subgroup analysis by cancer type, Mepitel reduced the incidence of radiation dermatitis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (OR = 0.25, 95%CI 0.13 to 0.46, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.0001), breast cancer (OR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.68, I2 = 24%, P = 0.0004), and various malignancies (OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.06 to 0.16, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.00001). Mepitel use was also associated with a lower incidence of moderate and severe skin injury in radiotherapy patients (RTOG grade II OR = 0.26, 95%CI 0.16 to 0.42, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade III OR = 0.19, 95%CI 0.12 to 0.30, P &lt; 0.00001; RTOG grade IV OR = 0.10, 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36, P = 0.0005), as well as a reduction in the severity of radiation-induced skin damage (combined RISRAS score, MD= -0.74 95% CI -1.02 to -0.46, I2 = 95%, P &lt; 0.00001; researcher RISRAS score MD= -0.47 95% CI -0.67 to -0.27, I2 = 90%, P &lt; 0.00001; and patient RISRAS score MD= -1.19 95% CI -1.33 to -1.05, I2 = 39%, P &lt; 0.00001). Additionally, patients treated with Mepitel experienced fewer cases of moist desquamation (OR = 0.46, 95%CI 0.25 to 0.83, I2 = 58%, P = 0.010), and shorter healing times (MD= -4.73, 95%CI -7.16 to -2.30, I2 = 98%, P = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Mepitel interventions significantly reduced RTOG grades and RISRAS scores, decreased the risk of moist desquamation, and shortened healing times for radiation-induced dermatitis in cancer patients. Further clinical studies are needed to better understand the relationship between Mepitel and radiation dermatitis in this patient population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding the association between pathologic treatment response and survival outcomes after neoadjuvant immunotherapy in HNSCC, providing valuable insights that could influence future treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mastrolonardo EV, De Ravin E, Kaki PC, Estephan LE, Nunes K, Kenny H, Bridgham K, Tasoulas J, Koeneman SH, Goldman RA, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4573'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4573&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41410931/'&gt;41410931&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Numerous phase 2 trials have evaluated the efficacy of neoadjuvant immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) for mucosal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), using some degree of pathologic treatment response as a primary or secondary end point. However, whether pathologic treatment response is a meaningful surrogate end point for survival has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To systematically assess the association between pathologic treatment response and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) after neoadjuvant ICI. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of the PubMed, OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases was performed from January 1, 2000, through May 31, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Peer-reviewed studies investigating neoadjuvant ICI for the treatment of mucosal HNSCC in patients 18 years and older were identified. Full-length English-language articles that presented pathologic treatment response and survival data (OS and/or DFS) and any association between the 2 were included. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three blinded reviewers independently extracted study characteristics, pathologic treatment response data, and survival data, including hazard ratios (HRs) and CIs when available, according to PRISMA guideline. Data were compiled for statistical analysis to calculate DFS, OS, and HRs using a random-effects model. The I2 index was used to report data heterogeneity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: HRs for the association of pathologic treatment response with DFS and OS. RESULTS: Eleven trials involving 451 patients met inclusion criteria, with 368 patients included in this meta-analysis. Nine nonrandomized and 2 randomized studies were included, including 7 cohort studies, 2 randomized clinical trials, and 2 retrospective cohort studies, each with a different neoadjuvant ICI regimen. Pooled analysis demonstrated that overall (primary tumor plus lymph node) partial pathologic response (PPR; ≤50% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; I2 = 2.1%) and major pathologic response (MPR; ≤10% residual viable tumor; HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.12-0.93; I2 = 0.0%) were both associated with improved DFS up to 2 years. PPR and MPR were not associated with improved OS. Nine of 11 studies were at low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Study findings suggest that overall PPR and MPR are associated with improved DFS. These data provide additional support for the potential use of pathologic treatment response as a surrogate for DFS after neoadjuvant ICI in resectable mucosal HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis with over 2000 patients, utilizing advanced deep learning for prognostic prediction in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have significant clinical implications, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing evidence typically associated with higher impact scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; You J, Ou H, Zhang Y, Wu X, Zhang L, Jin Z, Chen Q, Shen H, Liu X, Sun J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111223'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111223&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41429722/'&gt;41429722&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Deep learning can non-invasively depict the radiological phenotype of tumor. We aimed to propose an end-to-end deep learning framework called NPC-SurvAI to perform prognosis assessment using MRI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 2180 NPC patients who underwent baseline MRI. The NPC-SurvAI comprised an AttVNet for image segmentation and a DenseNet-ICAM for prognosis evaluation, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The clinical model was built with age, T-stage, N-stage, and EBV DNA. The image and combined models were developed by the NPC-SurvAI framework. The integrated area under the curve (iAUC) and thetime-dependent AUC (tAUC) were leveraged to measure the predictive accuracy. K-means clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to stratify patients into subtypes and compare their prognoses. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, the AttVNet achieved average Dice similarity coefficients of 0.726-0.764 tumor segmentation. The dynamic change curves of the AUCs over time suggested that the combined model outperformed both the clinical and image models in predicting PFS (iAUC: 0.838-0.884 vs 0.788-0.844 vs 0.738-0.798) and OS (iAUC: 0.842-0.894 vs 0.793-0.853 vs 0.754-0.807) at any time point from 1 to 8 years. Specially, the combined model achieved time-AUCs of 0.844-0.930 for 3-year PFS and 0.827-0.896 for 5-year PFS; 0.838-0.978 for 3-year OS and 0.788-0.871 for 5-year OS. Additionally, patients could be stratified into two subtypes with different survivals (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NPC-SurvAI has the potential to automatically stratify patients with diverse prognoses, which helps clinicians in optimizing treatment decisions and surveillance.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review includes a large number of participants (over 7.4 million) and addresses an important epidemiological question regarding the association between air pollution and laryngeal cancer, which has potential clinical implications, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Soopramanien J, Mittal S, Jadeja K, Soni L, Saghir S, Mannan F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41442908/'&gt;41442908&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambient air pollution is a major global health concern, yet its association with laryngeal cancer remains poorly defined. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants and incidence of laryngeal cancer. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were conducted from inception to 01/06/2024. Eligible studies included observational and ecological designs reporting quantitative associations between ambient pollutants and laryngeal cancer incidence. Study quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty graded were appraised using the NIH tool, National Toxicology Program framework and GRADE approach respectively. A total of nine studies (4 ecological, 5 cohort) comprising over 7.4 million participants were included. Each pollutant was analysed by a maximum of 3 studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) demonstrated the most consistent association with laryngeal cancer, with hazard ratios between 1.18 and 1.24 per 10 μg/m³ increase. One large cohort reported a significant relationship between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and laryngeal cancer (HR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.2-2.85), while findings across other pollutants, including PM₁₀, SO₂, O₃, CO, and NOₓ, were inconsistent. Although data remain limited, emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to ambient NO₂ and PM₂.₅ may increase laryngeal cancer risk. Future large-scale prospective cohort studies with standardized exposure metrics and robust confounding control are needed to better characterise this relationship. Natural experiments in regions undergoing major air-quality policy changes can provide valuable evidence on the impact of reducing exposure on laryngeal cancer incidence at a population level.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review of randomized controlled trials provides important insights into the role of exercise in improving postoperative outcomes for head and neck cancer patients, which has clinical relevance, though it does not present a large-scale study or definitive practice-changing findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ekici E, Yüzbaşıoğlu Ü, Özkeskin M, Özden F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09905-9'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09905-9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41430445/'&gt;41430445&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Understanding and optimizing exercise programs for individuals undergoing head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery is essential for improving postoperative quality of life. This review aims to examine the effects of exercise and physiotherapy interventions on various outcomes in individuals who have undergone HNC surgery. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials published within the past decade, yielding 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale. RESULTS: Except for one preoperative instruction session, all interventions were implemented postoperatively. The most frequently evaluated outcomes included shoulder, jaw, and swallowing function, as well as postoperative symptoms. Across studies, exercise programs with varying content consistently improved shoulder mobility, swallowing function, and symptom burden. CONCLUSION: Evidence from current studies demonstrates that exercise interventions contribute to improved functional outcomes and reduced symptom burden, supporting their inclusion as a core component of standard care in patients who have undergone head and neck cancer surgery.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding the predictive accuracy of ML/AI models for radiation-induced toxicities in head and neck cancer, providing valuable insights that could influence future research and clinical practice, though it does not present primary data or novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ugwu GC, Jalali F, Liu G, Li G, Langendijk JA, Alizadeh BZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111350'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2025.111350&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41421773/'&gt;41421773&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An increasing number of Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models are being developed to predict radiation-induced toxicities (RITs) in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). But their performance and reliability remain uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the predictive accuracy and methodological quality of these models. We comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies reporting on ML/AI models for predicting RITs in HNC patients. Eligible studies were assessed for bias risk using the PROBAST tool, and key performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC), were extracted. A hierarchical multilevel meta-analysis was performed to estimate pooled AUC values, and subgroup analyses explored the influence of study characteristics on model performance. A total of 67 studies with a total of 568 models were included, showing moderate discriminatory power of ML/AI models, with a pooled AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI: 0.73-0.78. Nonetheless, substantial heterogeneity was observed across studies. Incorporating imaging biomarkers significantly improved model performance. Prospective and internal validation showed comparable performance; external validation shows true generalizability. The predominance of retrospective designs and variability in predictor selection may have introduced bias, affecting model reliability and generalisability. ML/AI models hold promise for predicting RITs in HNC patients, but methodological constraints limit their applicability. Standardised and transparent reporting of model development and validation processes is vital for improving comparability among studies. Future research should explore hybrid modelling methods and the integration of clinical, dosimetric, radiomic, and genomic data to boost predictive accuracy.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important insights into the impact of facial nerve reconstruction on quality of life in patients with parotid malignancies, utilizing a retrospective analysis with objective and subjective measures. While the findings are significant, the study's retrospective nature and smaller sample size limit its potential to change clinical practice broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; He ZA, Xu N, Ma H, Chen HQ, Zhang LY, Zhang SC, Luo Y, Zhang YP, Ma Q, Ma LJ, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70112'&gt;10.1002/hed.70112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41431870/'&gt;41431870&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To evaluate facial nerve reconstruction's impact on quality of life (QoL) and clinical outcomes in radical parotid malignancy surgery. METHODS: Patients were stratified into the Preservation Group, Reconstruction Group, and Disconnection Group, retrospectively analyzed objective measures (from medical records and operative reports) and subjective measures (using the Sunnybrook Facial Grading System [SFGS] and Facial Clinimetric Evaluation [FaCE] scale) across the three patient groups. RESULTS: No significant differences in recurrence or mortality were observed between Reconstruction and Disconnection groups (p &gt; 0.05). Facial nerve reconstruction significantly improves outcomes in patients with high-risk parotid malignancies (p &lt; 0.05), despite higher-risk profiles in the reconstruction cohort. This improvement remained stable over time, showing no significant decline (p &gt; 0.05). Venous nerve conduit trap yielded superior facial nerve function and QoL versus end-to-end repair (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Facial nerve reconstruction effectively improves outcomes in parotid malignancy surgery. Venous nerve conduit trap application is better than end-to-end repair.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a prospective matched cohort design comparing two radiotherapy techniques in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with significant findings on cochlear dose and hearing outcomes, indicating potential clinical implications for auditory preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lien KH, Lin CY, Chen PY, Chang JT, Chen TY, Hung SP, Lee CH, Yap WK, Hsieh CE, Hsu CL, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70113'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503873/'&gt;41503873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare cochlear dose and hearing outcomes between intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large prospective analysis (n=174) identifying a novel prognostic biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have significant clinical implications for patient stratification, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Chen B, Wang D, Huang J, Yu S, Fang S, Chen C, Wang J, Pan J, Lin S, Guo Q, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111366'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111366&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41500466/'&gt;41500466&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) is a promising epigenetic biomarker in cancer. Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective cohort of 5,671 patients, providing important insights into the prognostic factors of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, which could influence treatment planning in a specific population. However, it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings characteristic of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Liu PT, Chiang CJ, Yang YW, Lee WC, Hsu WL, Chen TI, Lee HL, Wang CP, Liao LJ, Wang CC, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4'&gt;10.1186/s12885-025-15528-4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41492174/'&gt;41492174&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is increasing worldwide, with a well-established link to human papillomavirus (HPV). However, evidence on how lifestyle risk factors-particularly smoking, alcohol consumption, and betel-quid chewing-modify the prognostic impact of HPV-associated disease remains limited, especially in regions with high exposure burden such as Taiwan. Understanding the interplay between viral and lifestyle determinants is essential for accurate prognostication and treatment planning. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,671 OPSCC patients using data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry between 2018 and 2021. p16 status was used as a surrogate marker for HPV infection. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were compared across p16 status, age, sex, tumor location, cancer stage, lifestyle risk factors and treatment pattern using Kaplan-Meier method and multiple Cox models. Treatment-stratified analyses were additionally performed to evaluate whether lifestyle risk factors modified prognosis within p16-positive disease. RESULTS: Overall, 23.2% of OPSCC cases were p16-positive, with substantially higher p16 positivity among females (52.5%) and in tonsillar subsites. p16-positive patients had significantly better 5-year overall survival (69.0%; 95% CI, 66.0%-71.8%) than p16-negative patients (37.9%; 36.1%-39.6%). However, among p16-positive individuals, the presence of multiple lifestyle risk factors markedly attenuated the survival advantage, reducing 5-year overall survival from 78.6% (74.0%-82.5%) in those without lifestyle exposures to 57.6% (52.6%-62.4%) in those with smoking plus other risks. These gradients persisted after multivariable adjustment and across treatment modalities. In contrast, lifestyle risk factors were not independently associated with survival in p16-negative OPSCC, where prognosis was primarily driven by tumor stage, subsite, and treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This nationwide study provides novel evidence that the prognostic benefit associated with p16 positivity is substantially attenuated by multiple lifestyle risk factors. These findings highlight the importance of integrating viral and behavioral determinants into prognostic assessment and treatment planning. They also underscore the need to pair HPV-associated prevention strategies with efforts to reduce tobacco, alcohol, and betel-quid use in regions with high burdens of these exposures.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review includes multiple randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies, providing important insights into rehabilitation interventions for trismus in oral cancer patients, which has clinical implications. However, while it addresses a relevant issue, it may not lead to immediate practice changes or paradigm shifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang H, An Y, Liu D&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral diseases | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.70185'&gt;10.1111/odi.70185&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-04&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41486431/'&gt;41486431&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate rehabilitation interventions for oral cancer patients with trismus and clarify effects on trismus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search for randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies published up to November 28, 2024, was conducted across PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang using the PICOS strategy. The primary outcome was mouth opening distance. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and methodological quality using the Cochrane Handbook (version 5.1.0) and ROBINS-I. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024613003). RESULTS: The review included 15 articles, including eight randomized controlled trials and seven quasi-experimental studies. There were variations in the timing and type of rehabilitation. Most interventions started 2-3 weeks post-surgery. Three types of interventions, including exercise training, physical therapy, and speech training, improved trismus. CONCLUSION: Rehabilitation interventions are often used in combination, but the effectiveness of individual interventions remains unclear. Physical therapy has been shown to alleviate pain, while remote reminders can enhance adherence. Only a basic consensus on rehabilitation interventions can be summarized due to design differences. Future research should focus on conducting rigorous trials to provide more conclusive evidence.</description>

We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine the survival outcomes and resource utilization of patients with R/M SCCHNC who were treated with nivolumab. METHOD: Patients with R/M SCCHNC were included in the study if they received nivolumab between January 17th 2018 to August 31st 2022 in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and time-to-treatment discontinuation (TTD), were assessed using Kaplan-Meier. Cox proportional hazard model was used to explore the association between baseline patient characteristics and all-cause death. The incidence of healthcare utilization was estimated using the cumulative incidence function, taking death as a competing event. RESULTS: A total of 498 R/M SCCHNC patients received nivolumab (Mean age 62.9, 78.7 % male). The median OS was 6.0 months (95 % CI: 5.0-7.3) and median time-to-treatment discontinuation was 2.6 months (95 % CI: 2.3-3.0). There is no significant OS difference between older patients (age &gt; 75 years old) and younger patients (p-value 0.73). At 1-year post-nivolumab initiation, the cumulative incidence of emergency department visits is 50.6 % (95 % CI: 46.1-55.0 %) and direct hospitalization is 22.7 % (19.0-26.6 %). CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, the survival outcomes of nivolumab were similar to those observed in CheckMate-141 trial. We demonstrated that there is no survival difference between older and younger patients. Furthermore, more than half of patients exaperienced an hospital encounter with the healthcare system, suggesting significant healthcare resource utilization.</description>

The impact of perioperative extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage remains unclear. This study hypothesizes that calculated prophylaxis with piperacillin/tazobactam reduces early-onset SSI in this high-risk population. METHODS: From a microvascular reconstructed cohort, 161 with prior irradiation were retrospectively identified (tumor, N = 101; ORN, N = 60). SSI risk reduction was compared between patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam (N = 39) and standard prophylaxis (N = 122). RESULTS: With underlying SSI incidence of 36%, piperacillin/tazobactam showed a fourfold SSI risk reduction (HR 0.24; p = 0.002) across the entire cohort and a fivefold reduction in patients with bone resection (HR 0.17; p = 0.01). Subgroup analyses confirmed this effect with a sevenfold reduction in tumor patients (HR 0.14; p = 0.008) and a threefold reduction in ORN patients (HR 0.29; p = 0.04). Extended coverage did not significantly prolong antibiotic treatment times. CONCLUSION: In summary, calculated use of piperacillin/tazobactam in previously irradiated patients requiring microvascular reconstruction appears effective in reducing early-onset SSI.</description>

This study evaluated risk-adjusted dental utilization patterns and associated healthcare costs among patients with OOC in Medicare and commercially insured populations. METHODS: Using the 2013-2024 Merative™ MarketScan® Research Databases, individuals with at least one medical claim for OOC were identified and matched 1:1 to non-OOC controls using propensity score matching. Analyses were stratified by insurance type (Medicare vs. commercial). Outcomes included frequency of dental visits, types of dental procedures, treatment modalities, and total annual healthcare costs. RESULTS: The prevalence of OOC was 67 per 100,000 among commercially insured and 397 per 100,000 among Medicare enrollees. Compared with controls, OOC patients were older and predominantly male (all p&lt;0.01). OOC patients had significantly fewer annual dental visits than controls (2.79 vs. 2.98 [Medicare]; 2.81 vs. 3.20 [Commercial], all p&lt;.0001). Restoration and periodontal treatments were the most common dental procedures. Surgical treatment alone was more frequent among OOC patients (20.1% Medicare; 15.6% Commercial). The risk-adjusted total annual healthcare burden was $22,984 for Medicare and $47,542 for Commercial OOC patients (p&lt;.001). CONCLUSIONS: Despite higher medical costs and intensive cancer treatment, OOC patients had fewer dental visits, indicating a gap in survivorship care. IMPACT: These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated medical-dental care models and policies that enhance access to preventive and restorative dental services, potentially reducing complications, improving quality of life, and lowering healthcare costs among OOC survivors.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is a large retrospective analysis with over 700 cases comparing surgical approaches in parotidectomy, providing important insights into facial nerve preservation, but it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings characteristic of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Prince ADP, Schaaff C, Forner D, Oslin K, Smith J, Alevato MM, Hershey E, Chionis L, Neal MEH, Prince MEP, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70112'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70112&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503816/'&gt;41503816&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare facial nerve function and perioperative outcomes among antegrade, retrograde, and extracapsular parotidectomy approaches in benign and malignant tumors. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: Adults undergoing parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation between 2018 and 2023 were included. Demographic, surgical, and outcome variables were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable regression. RESULTS: A total of 740 tumors were analyzed (353 benign, 387 malignant). Antegrade dissection was performed in 288 cases (194 malignant), retrograde in 334 (167 malignant), and extracapsular in 118 (26 malignant). Transient and permanent facial weakness occurred in 20% and 5% of cases. After adjustment, extracapsular dissection (odds ratio [OR] = 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.7, P = .0058) significantly reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade dissection. Retrograde dissection (OR = 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-1.1, P = .11) demonstrated a trend toward lower rates of transient weakness relative to antegrade dissection. In malignant tumors, outcomes were similar across approaches. Extracapsular dissection was rarely used in malignant disease and reserved for selected cases. Antegrade dissection had longer operative times in benign and malignant tumors (P &lt; .001). Perioperative complication rates, unplanned visits, recurrence, re-operations, ED visits, and readmissions were low and not significantly different across techniques. CONCLUSION: In benign parotidectomy, extracapsular dissection significantly reduced transient facial weakness, while retrograde dissection demonstrated a trend toward reduced transient weakness compared with antegrade. In malignant disease, outcomes were similar across approaches. Selective application of extracapsular and retrograde techniques may optimize facial nerve outcomes and operative efficiency.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset from the National Cancer Database and provides important insights into the survival outcomes of HPV-positive versus HPV-negative sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma, which could have clinical implications, although it is a retrospective analysis rather than a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Oliver JR, Wang NC, Alapati R, Attwood E, Amanian A, Bur AM, Beahm DD&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70156'&gt;10.1002/hed.70156&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503790/'&gt;41503790&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: Human papillomavirus-related (HPV+) sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) is associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared to similarly staged HPV-negative SNSCC. However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large population-based dataset to evaluate the survival outcomes of different surgical approaches for T3b differentiated thyroid carcinoma, providing important insights that could influence clinical practice, though it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li C, Xiao X, Jiang H, Li B, Zhu Y, Li X, Ouyang H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107891'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107891&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702158/'&gt;41702158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The 2025 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for all T3b differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). However, the prognostic impact of the surgical extent remains inadequately characterized. This study evaluated the association between surgical approach and survival outcomes in T3b DTC. METHODS: We analyzed 6,920 T3b DTC patients (2004-2022) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (total thyroidectomy, n = 6,638; lobectomy, n = 282). Variable importance was assessed using SHAP values and permutation methods derived from Random Survival Forest models. The association between surgical approach and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Stratified survival analyses were performed by tumor size (≤20 mm, 20-40 mm, &gt;40 mm) and nodal status (N0, N1a, N1b). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using disease-specific survival as an alternative endpoint, with Fine-Gray models employed to account for competing non-thyroid cancer mortality. RESULTS: Variable importance analysis revealed that surgical approach minimally predicted outcomes (SHAP: 1.5%; permutation: 1.8%), ranking below age (43.1-55.8%), tumor size (21.2-22.2%), and nodal status (5.5-11.4%). Lobectomy showed equivalent survival to total thyroidectomy (adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68-1.37; 10-year OS 89.9% vs 89.6%, difference - 0.3%). Survival equivalence was consistent across all tumor size and nodal status subgroups, with favorable-risk patients (tumors ≤ 40 mm, N0) achieving disease-specific survival &gt; 96% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that surgical extent has minimal impact on survival in T3b DTC. Lobectomy may be an appropriate option for selected patients, supporting individualized rather than universal total thyroidectomy.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized phase 2 trial investigating a novel approach to treatment in high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could have significant clinical implications, although it is not a phase 3 trial and the sample size is not specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fan M, Yin Q, Li L, Lian Q, Tang Y, Yan L, Xu J, Huang Y, Wang H, Li H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702154/'&gt;41702154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Outcomes for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) remain suboptimal despite comprehensive therapy. Preclinical studies demonstrated that low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (LDFRT) could potentiate chemotherapy, warranting further investigation. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial enrolled LANPC patients with advanced nodal stage (N2-N3 with necrosis, extranodal extension, or short axis ≥ 3 cm). Eligible patients were randomized to the LDFRT or control group. All patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The LDFRT group received 50 cGy radiation twice daily for 2 days targeting positive lymph nodes during each cycle of IC. The primary endpoint was the overall (nasopharynx and lymph nodes) objective response rate (ORR) after IC, with the secondary endpoints including 2-year survival outcomes and safety. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (41 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After IC, the LDFRT group demonstrated a significantly higher overall ORR (100% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.03) and numerically higher CR rate (14.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.11). The LDFRT group achieved greater median lymph node and total tumor volume regression compared to the control group (90.1% vs 53.91%; 77.1% vs 55.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). After a median follow-up of 26.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) showed trends favored LDFRT (87.6% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.17; 90.1% vs. 77.1%, p = 0.23, respectively). Acute toxicities were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk LANPC, LDFRT with IC improved ORR and tumor volume reduction, and was associated with a potential benefit in PFS and DMFS.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis of 370 HNSCC cases with novel insights into immune ecotypes and their predictive value for immunotherapy outcomes, which could have significant clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xin Y, Yang L, Liu C, Li D, Liu Y, Liu Y, Shang X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107887'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107887&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702155/'&gt;41702155&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits heterogeneous tumour-immune microenvironments that limit the utility of single biomarkers such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumour mutational burden (TMB) for guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. This study developed and validated the Ecotype-Integrated Response Model for HNSCC (EIRM-HN), integrating single-cell states, spatial transcriptomic niches, and bulk transcriptomes to derive immune ecotypes that stratify ICI outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective multi-cohort study analysed 370 HNSCC cases (80 molecular, 210 immunotherapies, 80 control) profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing. Immune ecotypes were derived from integrated single-cell and spatial features, converted into weighted gene signatures, and projected into bulk ICI cohorts to train penalised Cox and logistic models and compare performance against PD-L1, tumour mutational burden, and published signatures, with external prognostic validation in the GSE65858 bulk cohort. RESULTS: Among 210 ICI-treated patients, four ecotypes occurred at similar frequencies. The most suppressive ecotype showed low CD8+ T-cell abundance, high regulatory T-cell abundance, and increased stromal fraction, with median progression-free survival of 3.8 months and overall survival of 9.1 months, versus 9.8 and 20.3 months in the lymphoid-enriched ecotype. EIRM-HN achieved progression-free and overall survival concordance indices of 0.71 and 0.70, improving to 0.75 and 0.74 after adding clinical covariates, and exceeding PD-L1 and TMB. In GSE65858, overall survival concordance index was 0.67 with a hazard ratio of 1.89 for high- versus low-risk strata. CONCLUSION: An ecotype-based, spatially anchored risk model integrating single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomic data provides improved prognostic stratification of HNSCC relative to established biomarkers and generalises to an external bulk cohort.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This prospective service evaluation involves a significant sample size of over 2,500 patients and addresses an important clinical question regarding triage in suspected head and neck cancer, potentially influencing practice patterns, although it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; North AS, Courtney-Wickes C, Jacob T&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-026-10023-3'&gt;10.1007/s00405-026-10023-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41699247/'&gt;41699247&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a nurse-led telephone triage clinic, utilising the Head and Neck Cancer Risk Calculator version 2 (HaNC-RC-v2) with consultant oversight, for patients referred on the UK two-week wait (2WW) pathway for suspected head and neck cancer. METHODS: A prospective service evaluation was conducted in a UK hospital receiving ~ 5000 2WW referrals annually. Between November 2023 and March 2025, 2,556 patients underwent telephone triage. Patients scoring ≥ 2.2% on HaNC-RC-v2 remained on the 2WW pathway; those scoring &lt; 2.2% were considered for downgrade to a 6-week review following consultant review of their case. Patients referred with an investigation showing a thyroid nodule suspicious for malignancy were sent straight-to-test for ultrasound-guided biopsy. Diagnostic performance was assessed using histologically confirmed malignancy as the reference standard. RESULTS: Of 2,556 triaged patients, 67 (2.6%) had cancer. At the 2.2% cut-off, 16.6% (424/2556) were downgraded, with 3 cancers later diagnosed (0.7%; 3/424). The overall negative predictive value was 99.3% with overall potential harm in 0.12% of all referrals. The straight-to-test pathway diagnosed 14 thyroid cancers (11.6%; 14/121) with shorter mean time to diagnosis (45.3 vs. 56.5 days). CONCLUSION: A nurse-led telephone triage clinic using HaNC-RC-v2 safely downgraded low-risk patients with minimal harm while maintaining a high negative predictive value. Incorporating straight-to-test improved cancer detection and expedited diagnosis. This pathway may enhance service efficiency in managing the increasing volume of suspected cancer referrals across various healthcare systems.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter development of a CADx model and external validation on independent cohorts. SETTING: Multicenter tertiary referral hospitals (Italy, India, China, Greece, and Spain). METHODS: Over 20,000 images derived from laryngoscopic examinations were retrieved. Images were annotated based on histopathology or expert consensus. A deep learning model was trained using an internal dataset and evaluated on 2 external datasets to assess generalizability. The CADx model classifies only images containing visible lesions, discriminating between LR and HR categories. Diagnostic performance was measured using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model performance was compared with physicians of varying expertise and ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The computer-aided diagnosis model achieved a similar performance across internal and external datasets in distinguishing HR from LR lesions, with accuracy/AUC of 0.90/0.89 internally, 0.85/0.85 on the Greek dataset, and 0.88/0.88 on the Spanish dataset. The model's accuracy was statistically noninferior to that of otolaryngologists and expert laryngologists, and superior to general practitioners and ChatGPT-4o. CONCLUSION: This is a large multicenter clinical validation of a CADx model for laryngeal endoscopy, demonstrating generalizability and performance comparable to clinicians in discriminating between LR and HR lesions. The model's success supports its potential role in augmenting diagnostic capabilities, especially in resource-limited settings. A prospective multicenter clinical trial is underway to assess real-world clinical implementation.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an SGC-specific pTNM classification with improved prognostic accuracy and optimized stage distribution for version nine of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging protocol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study validates a tumor DNA methylation signature in a multicenter cohort of HPV-negative HNSCC patients, addressing an important clinical question regarding metastasis risk after postoperative radiochemotherapy, but it is a phase of validation rather than a phase 3 trial or practice-changing finding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tawk B, Halec G, Rein K, Schwager C, Knoll M, Wirkner U, Held T, Weykamp F, Liermann J, Hoerner-Rieber J, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111433'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111433&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41672251/'&gt;41672251&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Tumor hypoxia is a predictive biomarker of treatment resistance in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We previously reported the discovery of a tumor DNA methylation signature of hypoxia (Hypoxia-M), identifying HNSCC patients at risk for local recurrence (LR), all event progression, and death after primary radiochemotherapy (RCHT). We further validate Hypoxia-M in an independent cohort of HNSCC patients who underwent surgical resection followed by postoperative radiochemotherapy (PORT-C) METHODS: Hypoxia-M was validated in HPV-negative HNSCC patients (n = 134) homogeneously treated with PORT-C in the frame of the German Cancer Consortium Radiation Oncology Group (DKTK-ROG) multicenter biomarker trial. DNA methylation was profiled using Illumina450K technology. The performance of Hypoxia-M was integrated with previously reported biomarkers, including gene expression signatures (GES) of hypoxia, a methylome-based HPV-Independent Classifier of disease Recurrence (HICR), and immune cell score using immunohistochemistry (CD3/CD8/PD-L1/PD1). RESULTS: Hypoxia-M was independently prognostic for overall survival (OS, HR = 2.34, p = 0.03) and distant metastasis (DM, HR = 4.3, p = 0.001), but not for LR after PORT-C. Hypoxia-M remained significant after adjusting for patientś age, gender, smoking status, tumor stage, and high-risk features (ECE&amp;/R1 resection). Hypoxia-M status was inversely associated with CD8 T-cell infiltration. Patient stratification improved by integrating previously reported biomarkers, with Hypoxia-M demonstrating independent prognostic performance. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic utility of Hypoxia-M was validated in an independent cohort. Our results highlighted a difference in recurrence patterns of hypoxic tumors treated in the primary setting (local recurrence) versus postoperatively (distant metastasis) and the utility of Hypoxia-M for identifying the main pattern of recurrence.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study presents a novel approach to risk stratification in pediatric thyroid carcinoma using DNA methylation profiling, which has clinical implications, but it is based on a relatively small sample size and is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li JZ, Ricarte Filho J, Isaza AR, Hinkle K, Xu F, Li MM, Bauer AJ, Franco AT, Zhou W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701943/'&gt;41701943&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of invasiveness in pediatric thyroid carcinomas is essential to prevent unnecessary surgery and avoid surgery-associated complications. DNA methylation, a proven molecular biomarker for cancer classification, holds promise for stratifying thyroid cancer risk. The objectives were to determine the epigenetic hallmarks of pediatric thyroid carcinomas and to investigate whether DNA methylome profiling is a feasible approach for pre-operative risk stratification of this pediatric disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from two separately processed cohorts of pediatric thyroid carcinoma. The reference cohort included 100 samples, consisting of 87 well-differentiated primary tumors-77 papillary and 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas-and 13 matched lymph node metastases. To predict oncogenic drivers and tumor invasiveness, defined by the presence of nodal metastasis, we trained two classifiers on the reference cohort and then evaluated their performance on a second validation cohort of 84 samples, including 83 primary tumors and one lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We identified distinct methylation patterns associated with tumor invasiveness and key driver mutations, including BRAF p.V600E, RAS-like mutations, kinase fusions, and DICER1 mutations. The differentially methylated regions reflect inflammatory stress, disrupted thyroid development and function, implicating AR, Hippo, and AP-1 signaling. Leveraging these epigenetic signatures, we developed and validated two methylation-based classifiers that accurately predict tumor invasiveness and oncogenic mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric thyroid carcinoma patients, DNA methylation assays accurately predict tumor invasiveness and driver mutations. Our findings highlight the clinical value of DNA methylation profiling for risk stratification and classification of pediatric thyroid cancers.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study explores a novel therapeutic approach using CD47 blockade in combination with immunoradiotherapy for HPV-negative HNSCC, which is promising but based on a preclinical model without immediate clinical application, thus falling into the moderate impact category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Monther A, Al-Msari R, Saddawi-Konefka R, Fassardi S, Tang C, Philips C, Sen P, Mohammadzadeh P, Decker K, Miyauchi S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; PloS one | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0328031'&gt;10.1371/journal.pone.0328031&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-01-01&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701713/'&gt;41701713&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with limited treatment options for patients with locally advanced disease. CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been used to block the CD47/SIRPa interaction that inhibits antigen-presenting cell phagocytosis, thereby enhancing antigen presentation to cytotoxic T-cells, and have shown promise in combination with anti-PD1 immunotherapy in tumors, including recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. We found that CD47 expression is associated with poor prognosis in HNSCC and explored the anti-tumor activity of an anti-CD47 fusion protein in combination with anti-PD1 and lymphatic-sparing radiotherapy in a locally advanced HNSCC model. In the 4MOSC1 syngeneic HPV-negative HNSCC mouse model, ALX301 (an engineered CD47-blocking SIRPα fusion for murine models) induced complete tumor regression when combined with anti-PD-1, and produced a partial tumor response as a monotherapy. An anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor in a CD47-null tumor background led to complete tumor regression confirming a key role for CD47 in tumor immunity. ALX301 treated mice demonstrated increased MHC-II expression on dendritic cells within the tumor and upregulation of CD86 co-stimulatory molecule on dendritic cells within the tumor, sentinel lymph nodes, and contralateral lymph nodes. Combination ALX301 and anti-PD1 treatment in an anti-PD1 resistant 4MOSC2 model demonstrated significant tumor regression, enhanced survivability, improved response with neoadjuvant radiotherapy, and greater retention of CD8 + T-cells within the tumor microenvironment. Notably, T-cell receptor sequencing revealed increased shared clonality between the tumor and sentinel lymph nodes of ALX301 treated mice. These data demonstrate that a combination of CD47 blockade and anti-PD1 therapy enhances tumor antigen presentation and immune cell infiltration, while further improving anti-tumor responses in combination with tumor-targeted radiotherapy. This study provides support for the rational design of combinatorial immunoradiotherapy, using anti-CD47 inhibitors and anti-PD1 therapy, in a clinical trial targeting locally advanced HPV-negative HNSCC.</description>

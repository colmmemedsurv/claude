      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 82/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This phase 1 trial evaluates a first-in-class therapy in combination with pembrolizumab for immune checkpoint blockade-resistant tumors, presenting promising insights into a novel treatment approach, although it is not a phase 3 trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yap TA, Sweis RF, Vaishampayan U, Kilari D, Gainor JF, McKean M, Barve M, Tarhini AA, Bockorny B, Sonpavde G, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Nature medicine | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w'&gt;10.1038/s41591-025-04157-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-13&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41530380/'&gt;41530380&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies have revolutionized oncology, many cancers are unresponsive or develop resistance that involves transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1). This multicenter, open-label, phase 1 study (DRAGON trial, SRK-181-001) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, predictive biomarkers and efficacy of linavonkibart, a first-in-class fully human selective anti-latent TGFβ1 antibody with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) therapy. The DRAGON trial was divided into three treatment parts: part A1 (dose-escalation cohorts with single-agent linavonkibart), part A2 (dose-escalation cohorts with the combination treatment of linavonkibart and pembrolizumab) and part B (dose-expansion cohorts with the combination treatment). The primary objective of the study was to determine the safety and tolerability of linavonkibart alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. Secondary objectives included evaluation of linavonkibart pharmacokinetics for each treatment paradigm, assessment of anti-linavonkibart antibody development (parts A and B) and measurement of antitumor activity (part B) after treatment. All primary and secondary objectives were met in the study. Overall, linavonkibart had a manageable safety profile, and combined therapy with pembrolizumab was generally consistent with that of pembrolizumab monotherapy. Dermatological reactions were the only additional risk identified. Neither cytokine release syndrome nor infusion interruption was observed in any patient enrolled in DRAGON. In part A (n = 34), no dose-limiting toxicities or grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred (linavonkibart; ≤3,000 mg once every 3 weeks (Q3W) and 2,000 mg once every 2 weeks (Q2W)). In part B (n = 78), patients progressing on prior anti-PD-1 therapy received linavonkibart (1,500 mg Q3W/1,000 mg Q2W) with pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W). This combination demonstrated confirmed objective response rates of 20.0%, 18.2%, 9.1% and 9.1% in anti-PD-1-resistant patients with clear cell renal cell cancer (ccRCC), melanoma, head and neck squamous cell cancer and urothelial cancer, respectively. Biomarker data provide proof of mechanism and a potential ccRCC patient selection strategy. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04291079 .</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis includes a large cohort of over 16,000 patients, providing important insights into oncologic outcomes following TORS in HPV-associated OPSCC, which has clinical implications for treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cheung MH, Kim CH, Nguyen SA, Williamson L, Kejner A, Bobian M, Newman JG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70101'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41521853/'&gt;41521853&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To define survival and recurrence outcomes of HPV associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) following transoral robotic surgery (TORS). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on studies employing TORS in HPV-associated OPSCC. Meta-analysis of continuous measures, proportions, and comparison of weighted proportion and relative risk were performed for patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies, comprising 16,129 adults treated with TORS for OPSCC, were included. The mean age was 59.5 years (SD 2.08) (range 18-93), with an average follow-up of 43.4 months (SD 13.36); 83.5% of the cohort was male, and 85.6% had HPV-positive OPSCC. In the HPV-positive group, TORS survival rates were 91.0% at 1 year, 94.9% at 3 years, and 89.8% at 5 years. In comparison, the HPV-negative group had survival rates of 92.3%, 84.2%, and 72.9%, respectively. Significant survival differences were observed between cohorts at 3 and 5 years (P &lt; .0001). The HPV-positive group had a significantly higher likelihood of 5-year overall survival compared to the HPV-negative group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34) Recurrence rates in HPV-positive patients were 2.0% local, 3.1% regional, and 5.3% locoregional, whereas HPV-negative patients had recurrence rates of 7.6% local, 6.0% regional, and 9.1% locoregional (P = .0037, .2143, .426, respectively). Distant metastasis rates were 5.6% in HPV-positive and 10.2% in HPV-negative patients (P = .0033). CONCLUSION: The higher survival rates and lower recurrences in HPV-positive OPSCC patients compared to their HPV-negative counterparts reflects the favorable long-term oncologic outcome seen in HPV-associated OPSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a prospective matched cohort analysis comparing two radiotherapy techniques in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with significant findings on auditory preservation, which could influence treatment approaches; however, it lacks the large sample size or practice-changing evidence typically associated with higher impact scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lien KH, Lin CY, Chen PY, Chang JT, Chen TY, Hung SP, Lee CH, Yap WK, Hsieh CE, Hsu CL, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70113'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503873/'&gt;41503873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare cochlear dose and hearing outcomes between intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 72/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective phase 2 trial evaluating a novel combination therapy in a challenging patient population with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory head and neck cancer, providing important insights into treatment options, though it lacks the robustness of a phase 3 trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; So J, Droznin A, Tiwari P, Chen YH, Chau N, Margalit DN, Tishler RB, Hanna GJ, Mak RH, Fitzgerald K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.043'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.043&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520892/'&gt;41520892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, non-randomized phase II trial enrolled patients with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory R/M HNSCC. In Cohort A, a single lesion was treated with SBRT while other sites were left unirradiated. In Cohort B, all known oligometastatic lesions were treated with SBRT. Pembrolizumab was administered every 3 weeks in both cohorts. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS). Correlative immune analyses were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using mass cytometry and TCRβ sequencing. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (6 in Cohort A, 12 in Cohort B). Median PFS was 1.8 months in Cohort A and 5.7 months in Cohort B. The 3-month PFS rate was 17% (1/6) in Cohort A and 67% (8/12) in Cohort B, with an overall response rate of 25% (3/12) in Cohort B and no objective responses in Cohort A. Median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: [0.7-32.9])in Cohort A and 10.1 months (95% CI: [5.8-49.7]) in Cohort B. In Cohort B there were 2 (2/12, 17%) Grade 4 toxicities observed in the setting of re-irradiation. Correlative studies showed that patients with PFS &gt;3 months had higher baseline frequencies of CD8+ central memory T cells and elevated CXCR5 expression on memory B cells. CONCLUSIONS: In anti PD-1-refractory R/M HNSCC, SBRT with pembrolizumab was safe and feasible, suggesting activity when all progressing lesions were treated. Immune profiling describes pre-existing memory T and B cell phenotypes that appear to correlate with treatment benefit. These findings support further study and clinical use of comprehensive SBRT plus PD-1 blockade in this hard-to-treat population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is a large multicenter retrospective cohort analysis that explores important prognostic biomarkers in a real-world setting for patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors, providing valuable insights into treatment outcomes, though it lacks the rigor of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Søby S, Mortensen D, Gothelf A, Gyldenkerne N, Maare C, Lonkvist CK, Andersen M, Kjeldsen R, Toustrup K, Tramm T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107849'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107849&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41529587/'&gt;41529587&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PD-1 inhibition has become an established treatment option for recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (rmHNSCC). However, there is a clear need for improved prognostic tools. This study aimed to identify immune-related tissue biomarkers associated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with PD-1 inhibition. This national real-world phase IV multicenter retrospective cohort study included Danish patients treated between 2017 and 2023. Pre-treatment biopsies were collected for immunohistochemical analyses. All patients were PD-L1 positive with histologically confirmed rmHNSCC treated with pembrolizumab or nivolumab monotherapy. Biomarker expression was assessed for CD4, CD8, FOXP3, CD20, CD66b, CD68, STING, cGAS, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), using the median expression as the cut-off value. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was obtained from 263 eligible patients. Concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 were associated with a lower risk of progression (HRPFS: 0.47 [95 % CI: 0.33-0.67]). This interaction appeared to be driven by p16+ oropharyngeal cancers (OPC), where patients with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68 showed a median 2-year PFS of 68 % [95 % CI: 42-86] in contrast to those with one or none of the two markers above the median level with a 2-year PFS of 3 % [95 % CI: 0-12] (p &lt; 0.001). In this real-world cohort, a subgroup with a promising prognosis was identified. This subgroup was characterized by p16+ OPC along with concurrent above median levels of FOXP3 and CD68. PD-L1 alone showed no significant association with outcomes.</description>

This study aimed to identify the optimal age threshold and evaluate its association with overall survival (OS) to improve risk stratification and inform individualized treatment strategies. METHODS: Data were extracted from the SEER database (2018-2021), the University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, and the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCC). Only HPV-positive OPC cases with complete survival records were included. The optimal age threshold was identified using restricted cubic spline modeling in combination with a recursive partitioning approach. Prognostic factors beyond HPV status and AJCC eighth edition stage were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to construct a risk stratification model. The primary endpoint was OS. RESULTS: Of the 10 283 eligible patients (87.9% male; median age, 62 years), 2.7% had distant metastases at diagnosis. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed that 62 years of age represents an important critical threshold. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that patients younger than 62 years exhibited significantly improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70; p &lt; 0.001). RPA stratified patients into five risk groups with distinct 2-year OS: extremely low (96.8%), low (93.7%), intermediate (86.1%), high (74.6%), and extremely high risk (47.5%). Among patients classified in the extremely low-risk group (T0-2N0-1M0 and younger than 62 years), no significant difference in OS was observed between those treated with radiotherapy alone and those treated with chemoradiotherapy. External validation in the UHN (N = 843) and NCC (N = 167) cohorts suggested that extremely low-risk patients might be spared concurrent chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a risk stratification model for patients with p16-positive OPC based on the AJCC eighth edition staging and age. Patients in the extremely low-risk group may derive limited benefit from concurrent chemotherapy, suggesting that its omission could be considered in selected patients and may help guide the design of future de-escalation trials.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large retrospective cohort from the SEER database to analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma, providing valuable insights into incidence trends and prognostic factors, but lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings characteristic of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao YD, Sun HW, Zha CP, Wang ZH, Sun CZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41524932/'&gt;41524932&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: This study aimed to comprehensively analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SGSC) using a large population-based cohort to determine temporal patterns, identify independent survival predictors, and evaluate treatment effectiveness for optimizing clinical management. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with SGSC between 2011 and 2021 were included. We analyzed clinicopathological features, incidence trends, and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 36.5 months, the overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.93% and 86.53%, respectively. The incidence of SGSC has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of 6.3 cases per year in 2011-2013 to 29.3 cases per year in 2019-2021. This increase was predominantly driven by early-stage (I/II) tumors (75.9%), with the parotid gland being the most common primary site. Multivariable analysis identified age &gt; 55 years and AJCC Stage IV disease as independent poor prognostic factors. Surgical intervention, including local tumor excision and glandectomy, was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Notably, patients who received a combination of surgery and radiotherapy had better outcomes compared to those who received either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study with extended follow-up clarifies the rising incidence and early-stage predominance of SGSC. Age, TNM stage, and surgical treatment were identified as key prognostic factors.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective phase 2 randomized trial comparing two radiotherapy techniques for T1aN0 glottic cancer, providing important insights into treatment outcomes and toxicity, although the sample size is relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Elsharief MM, Hassouna AH, Shouman T, Mosallam A, Elbadrawy A, Shawky A, Wahab AA, Abdelfatah SM&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111376'&gt;10.1016/j.radonc.2026.111376&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520731/'&gt;41520731&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Both Transoral laser surgery (TLS) and radiotherapy are used in the treatment of T1aN0 glottic cancer with similar oncological outcomes. Retrospective studies suggest excellent local control with single vocal cord irradiation that targets only the affected vocal cord. So, the aim of this study was to compare the treatment outcome and toxicity of the classic radiotherapy field vs single vocal cord irradiation (SVCI) technique. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a prospective phase 2 randomized study (clinicaltrial.gov registration NCT05679856). A total of 57 patients with T1aN0 glottic cancer were randomized. 28 were assigned to standard of care whole larynx radiotherapy that covers the whole larynx with a prescription dose of 63 Gy/28 Fractions (Fs) The remaining 29 patients were randomized to single vocal irradiation with a prescription dose of 58.08 Gy/16Fs. The primary endpoint was to prove superiority of SVCI in terms of voice quality by comparing voice handicap index (VHI) between the 2 study arms. Baseline VHI was recorded before treatment, at end of radiotherapy then during each follow up visit. RESULTS: Demographic and patients' characteristics were comparable between the 2 arms. The dose to different organs at risk were statistically lower in the SVCI arm. 2-year local control rate was 100% in SVCI arm and 96% in the whole larynx arm, with no significant difference. No grade 3 or 4 toxicities were reported in both treatment arms. Patients in the SVCI arm demonstrated lower VHI scores at 2 months and 1-year post-treatment, with median scores of 4 and 0, respectively, compared with 22 and 21 in the whole-larynx arm. CONCLUSION: SVCI is effective and safe treatment for T1aN0 glottic cancer with comparable local control rates and safe toxicity profile. SVCI was associated with superior voice outcome as evidenced by significantly improved VHI scores compared with whole larynx radiotherapy.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a phase II trial with a moderate sample size (n=57) focusing on personalized radiotherapy for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which presents novel insights but lacks the robustness of larger randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Caudell J, Echevarria M, Yang G, Kim Y, Kirtane K, Kish J, Muzaffar J, Zahid M, Chung C, Enderling H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.053'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.053&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41519405/'&gt;41519405&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: We previously developed a model of pre-treatment growth and on-treatment response dynamics, the proliferation saturation index (PSI) model, which derives the proliferating and radiosensitive proportion of a tumor based on clinically observed net growth prior to therapy. We hypothesized that personalization of fractionation using PSI would increase the percentage of patients achieving a rapid reduction in tumor size during radiotherapy (RT) for early-stage human papillomavirus related squamous cancers of the oropharynx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this single center nonrandomized phase 2 single arm trial, 113 patients underwent screening, and 57 patients were consented and enrolled. Pretreatment PSI was calculated, and patients were assigned to 60 - 70 Gy in 30 - 35 fractions given once daily (PSI≤ 0.75) or 60 - 69.6 Gy in in 50 - 58 fractions given twice daily (PSI&gt;0.75). The primary endpoint of the study was the rate of patients with ≥ 32% reduction in tumor volume at 4 weeks of RT, with a planned sample size of 60 patients, with an interim analysis after 49 patients. Secondary end points included locoregional failure (LRF), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: A total of 55 patients evaluable for the primary endpoint were consented and enrolled, and 32 (58%; 95% CI = 44%-71%) met the primary endpoint of ≥ 32% reduction at 4 weeks of RT, meeting criteria for efficacy, leading to early study closure. For the 54 patients evaluable for secondary endpoints, the cumulative incidence of LRF at 2 years was 2% (95% CI: 0-5.8), with a 2-year PFS of 92% (95% CI: 85-100), and a 2 year OS of 96% (95% CI: 91-100). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized RT fractionation based on PSI suggests a promising rate of mid-treatment response with favorable LF, PFS, and OS.

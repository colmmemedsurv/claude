      <description>&lt;h3&gt;🔥 CRITICAL - Score: 90/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial published in a top-tier journal (Lancet) evaluating the addition of nivolumab to standard postoperative therapy for high-risk head and neck cancer, which has the potential to significantly impact treatment guidelines and patient outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bourhis J, Aupérin A, Borel C, Lefebvre G, Racadot S, Geoffrois L, Sun XS, Saada E, Cirauqui B, Rutkowski T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41448222/'&gt;41448222&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Postoperative cisplatin and radiotherapy is the standard of care for high-risk resected locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). The NIVOPOST-OP trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of programmed death 1 blockade by nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in this setting. METHODS: This open-label, phase 3 trial evaluated adding nivolumab to cisplatin and radiotherapy after surgery for LA-SCCHN with high-risk pathological features. The main inclusion criteria were age 19-74 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx resected with macroscopic complete resection, and at least one high-risk pathological feature: nodal extracapsular extension, microscopically positive margins, four or more cervical nodal involvements without extracapsular extension, and multiple perineural invasions. 680 participants recruited in 82 sites across six countries (France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive cisplatin and radiotherapy (66 Gy, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks, for three cycles); or nivolumab 240 mg intravenously, followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy with three cycles of concomitant nivolumab 360 mg once every 3 weeks, and six cycles of adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg once every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival as per investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population. 230 disease-free survival events (relapses or deaths) were required to detect a hazard ratio of 0·65 with 0·05 two-sided α error, with 90% power. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03576417) and is active, but not recruiting. FINDINGS: The 680 patients were recruited from Oct 15, 2018, to July 3, 2024. The analysis was based on 666 participants randomly assigned until the cutoff date (April 30, 2024), at which point the required number of events was reached (median follow-up 30·3 months). Disease-free survival was significantly improved with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy versus cisplatin and radiotherapy alone, irrespective of programmed death ligand 1 expression (HR 0·76; 95% CI 0·60-0·98; stratified log-rank test p value=0·034). There was an increase in the rate of participants with treatment-related grade 4 adverse events with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy compared with cisplatin and radiotherapy (30 [10%] of 312 vs 16 [5%] of 306). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two participants in each group. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in high-risk resected LA-SCCHN improves disease-free survival with moderate toxic effect increase, and can be proposed as a new standard treatment.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This large retrospective analysis of over 221,000 patients provides important insights into the survival impact of immunotherapy in advanced HNSCC, with significant findings regarding overall survival that could influence clinical practice, although it lacks the rigor of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vuppala R, Long S, Sharbel D, Weir F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70140'&gt;10.1002/hed.70140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41450282/'&gt;41450282&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: We evaluated the association between immunotherapy (IO) and overall survival (OS) in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and examined outcomes by IO timing. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of national NCDB 2004-2022 United States adults with Stages III-IVB HNSCC. Exposure was any IO. The primary outcome was OS from diagnosis; analyses used multivariable Cox models, 24-month landmarking, and propensity methods. RESULTS: Among 221 116 patients (mean age: 62), 10 023 (4.5%) received IO. Median follow-up 37 months. IO was associated with lower mortality (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Landmark analysis showed benefit 0-24 months (HR: 0.76; 0.74-0.79) that reversed thereafter (HR: 1.09; 1.04-1.14). By intent, median OS was 53.2 months (neoadjuvant), 50.1 months (adjuvant), 16.5 months (later-line), versus 60.7 months without IO. Propensity analyses attenuated effects (HR: ~1.00). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world advanced HNSCC, IO confers modest early benefit with varied long-term results; outcomes vary by timing. Prospective biomarker-stratified trials are needed.</description>

METHODS: Patients with T1N0M0 OTSCC were identified from the SEER database. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was utilized to balance baseline characteristics between ND and non-ND groups. Survival differences between these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and log-rank tests. Additionally, a multivariable Cox regression model was applied to the pre-matched cohort to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 2426 cases were included. In the multivariable model adjusted for key prognosticators, ND was an independent factor associated with significantly improved OS and DSS. After PSM, 1702 well-balanced patients were analyzed. Subgroup analyses based on tumor characteristics revealed that favorable survival outcomes associated with ND were predominantly observed in patients with tumor sizes 11-20 mm and those with moderate or poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with small tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, survival outcomes were comparable between the ND and observation groups. CONCLUSION: ND was associated with improved survival for T1N0M0 OTSCC patients with 11-20 mm tumors and moderate/poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with smaller tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, the observation strategy had demonstrated survival benefits comparable to ND.</description>

There is considerable variation in the prevalence of histopathologically detected extranodal extension in comparable studies. The Head and Neck Cancer International Group, which includes 23 organisations managing patients with head and neck cancer, identified several challenges in evaluating histopathologically detected extranodal extension. Thus, the Head and Neck Consensus Language for Ease and Reproducibility (HN-CLEAR) and its global stakeholders prioritised developing diagnostic criteria and uniform terminology for histopathologically detected extranodal extension. The histopathologically detected extranodal extension working group established by WHO, International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting, American Joint Committee on Cancer, Union for International Cancer Control, North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology, and American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology committees undertook consensus deliberations using scanned whole slides and a PRISMA literature review-based scoping questionnaire. The guidelines were tested by 30 additional pathologists across six continents and strengthened with prescriptive diagnostic criteria and unifying terminology based on the inter-rater concordance analyses. This Review generates practically useful consensus diagnostic recommendations and aligned terminology for addressing the gaps in the histopathologically detected extranodal extension literature. The recommendations can be used globally and cater to all levels of medical resources, practices, and experiences, thus ensuring equitable patient care.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large prospective cohort of 5325 participants investigating the prevalence and dynamics of oral HPV infection, providing important epidemiological insights that could inform future clinical practices regarding head and neck cancer risk, although it does not directly address treatment or clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vani NV, Madhanagopal R, Subramanian MJ, Sundersingh S, Helen AX, Meenakumari B, Rao DM, Ganesan TS, Swaminathan R&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.70298'&gt;10.1002/ijc.70298&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-30&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41467594/'&gt;41467594&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with an increased risk of head and neck cancers (HNC), particularly oropharyngeal cancer. This longitudinal cohort study investigated the prevalence and dynamics of oral HPV infection among healthy adults in South India. A total of 5325 participants were enrolled, and demographic, behavioral, and oral gargle samples were collected. HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected using nested PCR (PGMY/GP) and genotyped by Sanger sequencing. HPV16 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was analyzed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and validated using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). Logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate odds ratios. At baseline, 5011 samples were analyzed; 274 (5.5%) were HPV-positive and 4737 were negative. Among 3792 initially HPV-negative participants followed up, 126 (3.3%) acquired new infections (median 8 months; range, 6-15 months). Of 274 baseline HPV-positive individuals, 241 were followed up: 24 (10%) showed persistence, while 217 (90%) cleared infection after a median of 9 months (range, 6-20 months). Sanger sequencing of 471 samples from prevalent and incident infections yielded 290 (61.6%) high-quality sequences; 284 (98%) were HPV16, with isolated detections of HPV18, HPV66, HPV70, and HPV89. Ten novel variants were identified-nine HPV16 and one HPV89-while remaining sequences aligned with established Indian cervical HPV lineages. None of the 176 HPV16 DNA-positive samples analyzed expressed mRNA by RT-PCR, confirmed in 136 samples using ddPCR. Oral HPV infection among healthy individuals in India appears predominantly transient. Long-term monitoring may elucidate the oncogenic potential of oral HPV in this population.</description>

Comparative HRQOL data between active surveillance, thermal ablation, and surgery remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare HRQOL among adults with PTMC undergoing active surveillance, thermal ablation, or surgery to inform shared decision-making. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 17, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included adult patients with PTMC and compared at least 2 relevant interventions while reporting PROs. Studies restricted to noncomparative designs or non-PTMC populations were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving discrepancies with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S guidelines; the meta-analysis adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified by a second. Study quality was assessed using established critical appraisal checklists. Random-effects models were applied to obtain mean differences with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was domain-specific HRQOL (eg, voice problems, neuromuscular symptoms, psychological distress), as measured using the Thyroid Cancer Quality of Life (THYCA-QOL), Korean Thyroid-specific Quality of Life (KT-QOL), and other validated instruments. RESULTS: Of 988 retrieved records, 13 studies comprising 5793 patients were included: 2356 underwent active surveillance, 242 received thermal ablation (211 radiofrequency, 31 laser), and 3195 underwent surgery (2350 lobectomy, 833 total thyroidectomy, 12 unspecified). Active surveillance was consistently associated with better PROs compared with surgery across thyroid-specific domains, including neuromuscular symptoms, voice problems, concentration issues, psychological distress, sympathetic complaints, feelings of being chilly, and scar-related concerns. Generic instruments (eg, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, version 2) supported these findings. Low-certainty evidence indicated that thermal ablation was associated with better HRQOL than surgery after 3 to 6 months, although these differences diminished by 12 months. Across studies, heterogeneity arose from differences in treatment strategies and comparators, outcome instruments and duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that patients whose PTMC was managed with active surveillance reported equal or better HRQOL than those undergoing surgery. These findings support the importance of incorporating PROs into shared decision-making for low-risk thyroid cancer.</description>

This study aimed to determine Tg cutoff values and evaluate the role of dynamic Tg monitoring in risk stratification in these patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 9753 patients with low- to intermediate-risk DTC who underwent total thyroidectomy without RAI at 11 Korean tertiary hospitals. Serum Tg levels were measured under thyrotropin suppression (&lt;2 mIU/L) at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively using high-sensitive assays (functional sensitivity, &lt;0.2 ng/mL). Optimal Tg cutoffs were determined by receiver operating characteristic curves and survival analyses. Results: Higher postoperative unstimulated Tg levels consistently predicted structural recurrence, with an optimal cutoff of 0.3 ng/mL (area under the curve: 0.815, 0.772, and 0.816 at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively). A Tg ≥ 0.2 ng/mL, the Korean Thyroid Association (KTA) guideline cutoff for biochemical remission (excellent response), showed high sensitivity for recurrence. Tg ≥ 5.0 ng/mL at 6 months, a KTA-defined threshold for a biochemical incomplete response, independently predicted an elevated recurrence risk. Kaplan-Meier curves showed stepwise declines in recurrence-free survival with increasing Tg levels. Notably, even Tg &lt; 0.2 or &lt; 0.3 ng/mL were associated with recurrence if levels rose over time. Conclusion: Unstimulated Tg levels are strongly associated with the risk of structural recurrence in patients with DTC who have undergone total thyroidectomy without RAI. The current cutoff values of 0.2 ng/mL and 5.0 ng/mL were clinically relevant, and Tg kinetics over time further improved risk stratification. These findings provide the first large-scale evidence from an East Asian cohort and underscore the importance of early, serial Tg assessment in this growing patient population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review includes a substantial number of participants (over 7.4 million) and addresses an important epidemiological question regarding the association between air pollution and laryngeal cancer, which has potential implications for public health and cancer prevention strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Soopramanien J, Mittal S, Jadeja K, Soni L, Saghir S, Mannan F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41442908/'&gt;41442908&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambient air pollution is a major global health concern, yet its association with laryngeal cancer remains poorly defined. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants and incidence of laryngeal cancer. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were conducted from inception to 01/06/2024. Eligible studies included observational and ecological designs reporting quantitative associations between ambient pollutants and laryngeal cancer incidence. Study quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty graded were appraised using the NIH tool, National Toxicology Program framework and GRADE approach respectively. A total of nine studies (4 ecological, 5 cohort) comprising over 7.4 million participants were included. Each pollutant was analysed by a maximum of 3 studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) demonstrated the most consistent association with laryngeal cancer, with hazard ratios between 1.18 and 1.24 per 10 μg/m³ increase. One large cohort reported a significant relationship between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and laryngeal cancer (HR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.2-2.85), while findings across other pollutants, including PM₁₀, SO₂, O₃, CO, and NOₓ, were inconsistent. Although data remain limited, emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to ambient NO₂ and PM₂.₅ may increase laryngeal cancer risk. Future large-scale prospective cohort studies with standardized exposure metrics and robust confounding control are needed to better characterise this relationship. Natural experiments in regions undergoing major air-quality policy changes can provide valuable evidence on the impact of reducing exposure on laryngeal cancer incidence at a population level.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective analysis of nearly 5000 patients, providing important insights into the accuracy of intraoperative assessment of extrathyroidal extension in differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which has clinical implications for staging and recurrence outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; An S, Park J, Kim K, Bae JS&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancers | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers17243914'&gt;10.3390/cancers17243914&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-07&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41463164/'&gt;41463164&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: In the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor-node-metastasis staging system, gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) into the strap muscles is classified as T3b when identified during surgery. In clinical practice, this invasion is primarily assessed intraoperatively by the surgeon and documented in the operative report, forming the basis of the final T3b staging. Because this evaluation is inherently subjective, its diagnostic accuracy remains uncertain. This study evaluated the accuracy of intraoperative gross ETE assessment and whether misclassification affects recurrence outcomes. METHODS: In total, 4987 patients who underwent thyroidectomy at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital during 2017-2022 were analyzed. Patients were categorized by concordance between intraoperative findings and final pathology: confirmed gross ETE (Group A), intraoperative overestimation (Group B), and intraoperative underestimation (Group C). Clinical characteristics, recurrence rates, and predictors of inaccurate assessment were compared. RESULTS: Of the cohort, 179 patients (3.6%) were judged intraoperatively to have gross ETE, classified as Group A (141 patients), Group B (38), and Group C (33). Recurrence rates were not significantly different among groups (6.4%, 2.6%, and 3.0% in Groups A, B, and C, respectively). Other than lymphatic invasion and tumor size, baseline characteristics were comparable among groups. Multivariate analysis identified age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.961; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.932-0.990; p = 0.009), tumor location (OR: 0.182; 95% CI: 0.056-0.591; p = 0.005), and lymphatic invasion (OR: 0.292; 95% CI: 0.118-0.719; p = 0.007) as independent predictors of inaccurate intraoperative evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Among 179 patients suspected of gross ETE intraoperatively, 21.2% showed no muscle invasion on pathology. Although recurrence rates were similar across groups, recurrence-free survival tended to be lower in Group A relative to Group B, indicating the potential prognostic relevance of accurate intraoperative T3b identification. Long-term follow-up is needed to confirm this trend.</description>

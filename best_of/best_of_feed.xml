      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large population-based dataset with over 6,900 patients, providing important insights into surgical approaches for T3b differentiated thyroid carcinoma, which could influence clinical practice and guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li C, Xiao X, Jiang H, Li B, Zhu Y, Li X, Ouyang H&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107891'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107891&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702158/'&gt;41702158&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: The 2025 American Thyroid Association guidelines recommend total thyroidectomy for all T3b differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). However, the prognostic impact of the surgical extent remains inadequately characterized. This study evaluated the association between surgical approach and survival outcomes in T3b DTC. METHODS: We analyzed 6,920 T3b DTC patients (2004-2022) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (total thyroidectomy, n = 6,638; lobectomy, n = 282). Variable importance was assessed using SHAP values and permutation methods derived from Random Survival Forest models. The association between surgical approach and overall survival (OS) was evaluated using multivariable Cox regression. Stratified survival analyses were performed by tumor size (≤20 mm, 20-40 mm, &gt;40 mm) and nodal status (N0, N1a, N1b). Sensitivity analyses were conducted using disease-specific survival as an alternative endpoint, with Fine-Gray models employed to account for competing non-thyroid cancer mortality. RESULTS: Variable importance analysis revealed that surgical approach minimally predicted outcomes (SHAP: 1.5%; permutation: 1.8%), ranking below age (43.1-55.8%), tumor size (21.2-22.2%), and nodal status (5.5-11.4%). Lobectomy showed equivalent survival to total thyroidectomy (adjusted HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.68-1.37; 10-year OS 89.9% vs 89.6%, difference - 0.3%). Survival equivalence was consistent across all tumor size and nodal status subgroups, with favorable-risk patients (tumors ≤ 40 mm, N0) achieving disease-specific survival &gt; 96% in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that surgical extent has minimal impact on survival in T3b DTC. Lobectomy may be an appropriate option for selected patients, supporting individualized rather than universal total thyroidectomy.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized phase 2 trial exploring a novel combination of low-dose fractionated radiotherapy and induction chemotherapy in high-risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which could provide important insights and implications for treatment, although it is not a phase 3 trial and the sample size is not specified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fan M, Yin Q, Li L, Lian Q, Tang Y, Yan L, Xu J, Huang Y, Wang H, Li H, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107888&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702154/'&gt;41702154&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Outcomes for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (LANPC) remain suboptimal despite comprehensive therapy. Preclinical studies demonstrated that low-dose fractionated radiotherapy (LDFRT) could potentiate chemotherapy, warranting further investigation. METHODS: This open-label, randomized phase 2 trial enrolled LANPC patients with advanced nodal stage (N2-N3 with necrosis, extranodal extension, or short axis ≥ 3 cm). Eligible patients were randomized to the LDFRT or control group. All patients received three cycles of induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The LDFRT group received 50 cGy radiation twice daily for 2 days targeting positive lymph nodes during each cycle of IC. The primary endpoint was the overall (nasopharynx and lymph nodes) objective response rate (ORR) after IC, with the secondary endpoints including 2-year survival outcomes and safety. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients (41 per group) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. After IC, the LDFRT group demonstrated a significantly higher overall ORR (100% vs. 85.4%, p = 0.03) and numerically higher CR rate (14.6% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.11). The LDFRT group achieved greater median lymph node and total tumor volume regression compared to the control group (90.1% vs 53.91%; 77.1% vs 55.1%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). After a median follow-up of 26.2 months, the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) showed trends favored LDFRT (87.6% vs. 71.9%, p = 0.17; 90.1% vs. 77.1%, p = 0.23, respectively). Acute toxicities were comparable between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk LANPC, LDFRT with IC improved ORR and tumor volume reduction, and was associated with a potential benefit in PFS and DMFS.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes voxel-based analysis to identify functional subregions predictive of xerostomia after radiotherapy, addressing an important clinical issue in head and neck cancer treatment, although it is based on a moderate sample size and does not present practice-changing findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cubero L, Acosta O, Pascau J, Palard-Novello X, Barateau A, Campillo-Giménez B, de Crevoisier R, Castelli J&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2026.01.040&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41707993/'&gt;41707993&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Xerostomia is a common and debilitating toxicity following head and neck cancer (HNC) radiotherapy (RT). Although adaptive radiotherapy (ART) strategies can reduce mean parotid gland (PG) dose, clinical trials have shown limited benefit in reducing xerostomia, suggesting global dose metrics may be insufficient. Voxel-based analysis (VBA) enables assessing local dose-toxicity relationships and may identify symptom-related subregions (SRS) more predictive of toxicity. This study aimed to identify xerostomia-associated SRS using VBA and assess their relevance using a functional salivary atlas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients with locally advanced oropharyngeal cancer treated with chemoradiotherapy were randomized to receive standard RT or weekly ART. Xerostomia was assessed at 12 months post-treatment using stimulated salivary flow (SSF), with values ≤ 500 mg/min indicating xerostomia. A customized VBA was applied to identify subregions from voxel-wise dose differences between patients with and without xerostomia using a permutation test (planned dose in standard arm and accumulated dose in ART arm). To assess clinical relevance, a functional salivary atlas was generated from PSMA-PET/CT scans of 13 prostate cancer patients and compared with the subregions. A dosimetric analysis evaluated the predictive value of dose in overlapping regions. RESULTS: VBA identified a subregion (300.2 cc) with significantly higher doses in xerostomia patients, located contralaterally near the nasopharynx. Overlap with the functional PSMA-PET atlas revealed two clinically relevant subregions in the contralateral PG (SRSPG, 6.8cc) and tubarial gland (SRStubarial, 12.7 cc), with doses &gt; 11.5 Gy higher in xerostomia patients. Logistic regression models yielded high predictive performance, with maximum AUCs of 0.88 for SRSPG and 0.88 for SRStubarial. CONCLUSION: VBA revealed two predictive subregions-within the contralateral PG and tubarial glands-strongly associated with xerostomia at 12 months post-RT. Our findings offer a plausible explanation for the persistence of xerostomia despite PG sparing and support incorporating subregional dose metrics and tubarial gland sparing into RT planning.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study presents a large retrospective analysis (n=370) with novel insights into immune ecotypes that could influence immunotherapy outcomes in HNSCC, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing evidence typically associated with higher impact scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Xin Y, Yang L, Liu C, Li D, Liu Y, Liu Y, Shang X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107887'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107887&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-16&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41702155/'&gt;41702155&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits heterogeneous tumour-immune microenvironments that limit the utility of single biomarkers such as programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and tumour mutational burden (TMB) for guiding immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy. This study developed and validated the Ecotype-Integrated Response Model for HNSCC (EIRM-HN), integrating single-cell states, spatial transcriptomic niches, and bulk transcriptomes to derive immune ecotypes that stratify ICI outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective multi-cohort study analysed 370 HNSCC cases (80 molecular, 210 immunotherapies, 80 control) profiled by single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and bulk RNA sequencing. Immune ecotypes were derived from integrated single-cell and spatial features, converted into weighted gene signatures, and projected into bulk ICI cohorts to train penalised Cox and logistic models and compare performance against PD-L1, tumour mutational burden, and published signatures, with external prognostic validation in the GSE65858 bulk cohort. RESULTS: Among 210 ICI-treated patients, four ecotypes occurred at similar frequencies. The most suppressive ecotype showed low CD8+ T-cell abundance, high regulatory T-cell abundance, and increased stromal fraction, with median progression-free survival of 3.8 months and overall survival of 9.1 months, versus 9.8 and 20.3 months in the lymphoid-enriched ecotype. EIRM-HN achieved progression-free and overall survival concordance indices of 0.71 and 0.70, improving to 0.75 and 0.74 after adding clinical covariates, and exceeding PD-L1 and TMB. In GSE65858, overall survival concordance index was 0.67 with a hazard ratio of 1.89 for high- versus low-risk strata. CONCLUSION: An ecotype-based, spatially anchored risk model integrating single-cell, spatial, and bulk transcriptomic data provides improved prognostic stratification of HNSCC relative to established biomarkers and generalises to an external bulk cohort.</description>

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter development of a CADx model and external validation on independent cohorts. SETTING: Multicenter tertiary referral hospitals (Italy, India, China, Greece, and Spain). METHODS: Over 20,000 images derived from laryngoscopic examinations were retrieved. Images were annotated based on histopathology or expert consensus. A deep learning model was trained using an internal dataset and evaluated on 2 external datasets to assess generalizability. The CADx model classifies only images containing visible lesions, discriminating between LR and HR categories. Diagnostic performance was measured using standard metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Model performance was compared with physicians of varying expertise and ChatGPT-4o. RESULTS: The computer-aided diagnosis model achieved a similar performance across internal and external datasets in distinguishing HR from LR lesions, with accuracy/AUC of 0.90/0.89 internally, 0.85/0.85 on the Greek dataset, and 0.88/0.88 on the Spanish dataset. The model's accuracy was statistically noninferior to that of otolaryngologists and expert laryngologists, and superior to general practitioners and ChatGPT-4o. CONCLUSION: This is a large multicenter clinical validation of a CADx model for laryngeal endoscopy, demonstrating generalizability and performance comparable to clinicians in discriminating between LR and HR lesions. The model's success supports its potential role in augmenting diagnostic capabilities, especially in resource-limited settings. A prospective multicenter clinical trial is underway to assess real-world clinical implementation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large cohort (n=490,969) to explore etiologic heterogeneity in oral cavity cancers, providing important insights into risk factors that could influence future research and clinical practice. While it does not present a randomized trial or novel therapeutic findings, its implications for understanding disease biology and epidemiology are significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yano Y, Tota JE, Graubard BI, Liao LM, Kahle L, Cheung LC, Abnet CC, Chaturvedi AK&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.70309'&gt;10.1002/cncr.70309&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-15&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701516/'&gt;41701516&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Oral cavity cancers are generally considered etiologically similar, with a majority (&gt;75%) attributable to smoking/alcohol. Yet, incidence trends for oral cavity cancers have recently diverged in the United States and several European countries (with declines for most oral cavity cancers but increases for oral tongue cancers), suggesting etiologic differences. This study quantified etiologic heterogeneity across oral cavity cancers using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. METHODS: Cox regression models were used to quantify associations (hazard ratios [HRs] and population attributable fractions [PAFs]) and etiologic heterogeneity for risk factors across oral cavity anatomic sites. RESULTS: Among 490,969 individuals (6,732,760 person-years), 765 incident oral cavity cancers occurred. There was substantial heterogeneity in the associations of smoking and alcohol within constituent oral cavity cancers (HRs for current smokers, &gt;2 drinks/day vs. never-smokers/nondrinkers: floor of mouth = 14.7; hard palate and other mouth = 8.1; oral tongue = 4.9; gum = 2.6; lip = 1.5). PAFs for smoking/alcohol varied widely, ranging from 12.0% for the lip to 56% for the floor of mouth. We observed unexpected associations of increased oral tongue cancer risk with increased consumption of vegetables: total vegetables without legumes (HR per cup equivalent/day, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27); Solanaceae (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.20-1.70); Umbelliferae (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.30-4.12); and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78). Associations for total vegetables (HR, 1.12), Solanaceae (HR, 1.26), and dark green leafy vegetables (HR, 1.32) were remarkably similar in the PLCO trial, a prospective US cohort of ∼155,000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the need for disaggregation of oral cavity cancer sites in etiologic studies and reappraisal of widely accepted smoking/alcohol relative risks/attributable fractions.</description>

OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate an SGC-specific pTNM classification with improved prognostic accuracy and optimized stage distribution for version nine of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control staging protocol. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective prognostic cohort study derived a novel pTNM classification using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) of patients with surgically treated major SGC (2012-2017) and validated it in an international major SGC cohort (2008-2021) and a single-institution minor SGC cohort (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center; 1985-2016). Data were analyzed from June to November 2024. EXPOSURES: Surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis was used to confirm the prognostic importance of pathologically positive lymph node (LN) number and extranodal extension (pENE) and derive an optimal pTNM classification. RESULTS: The NCDB dataset included 8409 patients with SGC: 7659 with M0 disease (5748 with pN0 disease and 1911 with pN+ disease) and 750 with M1 disease. Among the 7659 patients with M0 disease, the median (IQR) age was 60 (48-71) years, and 3861 (50.4%) were male. The median (IQR) follow-up was 88.4 (72.3-108.5) months. The 5-year OS was 87.2% (95% CI, 86.3-88.0) for N0 disease, 68.2% (95% CI, 63.9-72.8) for 1 positive LN without pENE, 60.2% (95% CI, 53.5-67.5) for 2 positive LNs without pENE, 68.4% (95% CI, 58.0-76.6) for 3 positive LNs without pENE, 47.5% (95% CI, 41.6-52.8) for more than 3 positive LNs without pENE, and 41.4% (38.1-44.8) for pENE-positive LNs. Multivariable analysis confirmed the independent prognostication of LN count compared with pN0 disease (1 positive LN: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.70; 95% CI, 1.44-2.01; 2 positive LNs: aHR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.31-1.98; 3 positive LNs: aHR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.65-2.68; 4 positive LNs : aHR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.87-3.24; more than 4 positive LNs: aHR, 2.07; 95% CI, 2.08-2.91) and pENE-positive LNs compared with pENE-negative LNs (aHR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48). The proposed pN classification were pN1 for 1 to 3 positive LNs and pENE negativity and pN2 for more than 3 positive LNs or pENE positivity. Model fit improved with the proposed pN classification vs the current pN classification (Akaike Information Criterion, 26 442 vs 26 483). Based on the aHR model, the following stage groups were proposed: stage I: T1N0 (1 [reference]); stage II: T2N0 (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.11-1.61); stage IIIA: T1-2N1 or T3-4N0 (aHR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.99-2.80); stage IIIB: T1-2N2 or T3-4N1-2 (aHR, 5.15; 95% CI, 4.38-6.06); and stage IV: M1 disease (aHR, 13.61; 95% CI, 11.37-16.29). The C index values were similar (proposed classification: 0.792; current classification: 0.790), while the AIC improved slightly (proposed classification: 26 441; current classification: 26 482). Stage-specific OS differences were evident in both the international major SGC cohort (n = 1015) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center minor SGC cohort (n = 444). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This unified, SGC-specific staging system improved prognostic accuracy and sample size balance and was applicable to both major and minor SGCs.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a large retrospective cohort study with nearly 1,900 patients, providing important insights into discharge location and its impact on quality outcomes in head and neck cancer surgery, though it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing potential of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Benites C, White C, Balaguru L, Gonghao L, Lee JH, Conrad DJ, Lam A, Dziegielewski PT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107879'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107879&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-11&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41679078/'&gt;41679078&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Discharge (DC) to post-acute care facilities after head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery is common. Studies in various fields of medicine have shown that DC to facilities is associated with clinical outcomes. Evidence specific to HNC surgery is limited. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate how DC, to either home or a facility, impacts outcomes for patients undergoing HNC surgery. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent HNC surgery between January 1, 2014, and January 1, 2023 was performed. Patients were included based on postoperative hospitalization, surgical interventions, and a minimum 30-day follow-up. The primary outcomes were 30-day readmission, 30-day mortality, and postoperative complication severity. RESULTS: Among 1,895 patients (mean age 63 years, 67% female), 1,554 (82%) were DC home and 341 (18%) to a facility. After adjusting for significant variables, DC site was not associated with readmission (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.63-1.40), mortality (0.6% home vs 1.5% facility, p = 0.2), or complication severity (mild OR 1.3, p = 0.11; severe OR 1.0, p = 0.92). Factors such as dependency in activities of daily living, tracheotomy presence, surgery severity and prolonged hospitalization were found to be significant covariates in the multivariable analysis for both 30-day readmissions and complication severity. Facility patients had more infections or wound dehiscence (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Although DC to a facility was not significantly associated with worsened outcomes in the multivariable analysis, the findings of this study revealed clinically relevant differences in complication rates and readmission.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study is a large retrospective cohort analysis with over 15,000 patients, providing important insights into long-term morbidities associated with postoperative hypoparathyroidism in thyroid cancer patients, though it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings typical of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ahn SH, Seo SH, Jung CY, Yu DH, Kim KP, Kim Y, Cho Y, Seo DH, Kim SH, Yoo JI, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1177/10507256261425690'&gt;10.1177/10507256261425690&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-18&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41705866/'&gt;41705866&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Chronic hypoparathyroidism (hypoPT) is associated with various systemic morbidities; however, its impact in thyroid cancer patients following thyroidectomy remains unclear. This study evaluated the risk of long-term morbidities in thyroid cancer patients who developed permanent postoperative hypoparathyroidism (PO-hypoPT), compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study using South Korea's nationwide claims data encoded in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. Among 217,156 thyroid cancer patients who underwent thyroidectomy from 2013 to 2020, 15,592 patients with PO-hypoPT and 27,906 matched controls with preserved parathyroid function were identified after 1:2 propensity score (PS) matching. Long-term morbidities associated with hypoPT included nephrolithiasis, renal insufficiency, major adverse cardiac events (MACE), seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression. Hazard ratios (HRs) for these morbidities were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after large-scale PS matching. RESULTS: The median follow-up duration in both groups was approximately 5 years. Patients with PO-hypoPT had a significantly higher risk of nephrolithiasis (HR 1.17, confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.30), renal insufficiency (HR 1.75, [CI 1.50-2.03]), and MACE (HR 1.10, [CI 1.01-1.19]) compared to those with preserved parathyroid function. However, the risks of other long-term morbidities, including seizures, infections, cataracts, and depression, were not significantly different between the two groups. The association between PO-hypoPT and renal insufficiency remained consistent across all subgroups stratified by sex, age, and duration of calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: PO-hypoPT in thyroid cancer patients is associated with increased long-term morbidity, particularly renal and cardiovascular complications. Long-term monitoring of renal function and cardiovascular health is warranted in this population.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study presents a novel approach to risk stratification in pediatric thyroid carcinoma using DNA methylation profiling, which has clinical implications, but it is based on a relatively small sample size and lacks the robustness of larger prospective studies or randomized trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Li JZ, Ricarte Filho J, Isaza AR, Hinkle K, Xu F, Li MM, Bauer AJ, Franco AT, Zhou W&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-2109&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-17&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41701943/'&gt;41701943&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Accurate assessment of invasiveness in pediatric thyroid carcinomas is essential to prevent unnecessary surgery and avoid surgery-associated complications. DNA methylation, a proven molecular biomarker for cancer classification, holds promise for stratifying thyroid cancer risk. The objectives were to determine the epigenetic hallmarks of pediatric thyroid carcinomas and to investigate whether DNA methylome profiling is a feasible approach for pre-operative risk stratification of this pediatric disease. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We interrogated genome-wide DNA methylation profiles from two separately processed cohorts of pediatric thyroid carcinoma. The reference cohort included 100 samples, consisting of 87 well-differentiated primary tumors-77 papillary and 10 follicular thyroid carcinomas-and 13 matched lymph node metastases. To predict oncogenic drivers and tumor invasiveness, defined by the presence of nodal metastasis, we trained two classifiers on the reference cohort and then evaluated their performance on a second validation cohort of 84 samples, including 83 primary tumors and one lymph node metastasis. RESULTS: We identified distinct methylation patterns associated with tumor invasiveness and key driver mutations, including BRAF p.V600E, RAS-like mutations, kinase fusions, and DICER1 mutations. The differentially methylated regions reflect inflammatory stress, disrupted thyroid development and function, implicating AR, Hippo, and AP-1 signaling. Leveraging these epigenetic signatures, we developed and validated two methylation-based classifiers that accurately predict tumor invasiveness and oncogenic mutation subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric thyroid carcinoma patients, DNA methylation assays accurately predict tumor invasiveness and driver mutations. Our findings highlight the clinical value of DNA methylation profiling for risk stratification and classification of pediatric thyroid cancers.</description>

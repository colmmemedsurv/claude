      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important insights into the role of androgen receptor signaling in CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction in HNSCC and suggests a novel therapeutic approach with androgen deprivation therapy, which could have significant clinical implications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang Q, Tan Z, Zheng C, Xu J, Li Q, Hong S, Yu D, Hu X, Wang J, Jiang L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2384'&gt;10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2384&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41661680/'&gt;41661680&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exhibits a distinct sex disparity in incidence, with a higher incidence in males than females. Recent studies have suggested that this difference persists even after accounting for smoking and alcohol use, highlighting the need to elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrated that sex differences in HNSCC are androgen-dependent and identified androgen receptor (AR) signaling as a key regulator of the tumor immune microenvironment by modulating CD8⁺ T cell differentiation and function. Mechanically, early growth response 4 (EGR4) functioned as a direct downstream transcriptional effector of AR that induced CD8⁺ T cell dysfunction. Clinically, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) was an effective therapeutic strategy in HNSCC, suppressing tumor growth in mice while improving intratumoral CD8⁺ T cell function. Moreover, combining ADT with immune checkpoint inhibitors led to improved antitumor efficacy. Together, these findings reveal ADT as a promising therapeutic approach to enhance the antitumor activity of sex-biased CD8⁺ T cells in HNSCC, which could inform the development of sex-biased immunotherapies for treating HNSCC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study addresses a critical evidence gap in the treatment of R/M SCCHN after pembrolizumab failure, presenting a novel combination therapy with potential clinical implications, although it is a phase 2 trial and published in a specialty journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Fuereder T, Klinghammer K, Hahn D, Grünberger B, Melchardt T, Greil R, Kocher F, Gamerith G, Wagner C, Berchtold L, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; ESMO open | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.esmoop.2026.106061'&gt;10.1016/j.esmoop.2026.106061&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Feb-05&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41650746/'&gt;41650746&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: No standard second-line treatment has been established for patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy, representing a critical evidence gap in current clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with R/M SCCHN of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, or oral cavity, progressing after first-line pembrolizumab-based regimens, received paclitaxel (PTX) 175 mg/m2 every 21 days plus weekly cetuximab (C) 250 mg/m2 for up to six cycles, followed by C maintenance. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included best overall response (BoR), disease control rate (DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DoR), quality of life, and safety. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were enrolled (median age 64 years). Twenty-five patients (43.9%) had a primary tumor in the oropharynx, 17 (29.8%) in the oral cavity, 9 (15.8%) in the hypopharynx, and 6 (10.5%) in the larynx. The ORR was 43.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 30.7% to 57.6%], the BoR was 47.4% (95% CI 34.0% to 61.0%) with nine (15.8%) complete responses, and the DCR was 71.9% (95% CI 58.5% to 83.0%). DoR was 5.7 months (95% CI 5.1 months-not reached). Median PFS and OS were 5.9 months (95% CI 5.5-8.4 months) and 12.2 months (95% CI 10.5-17.6 months), respectively. Six-month PFS and OS rates were 49.0% and 73.0%, respectively. The most frequent non-hematological treatment-related adverse events were C-associated skin rash (78.9%) and PTX-related polyneuropathy (35.1%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospective trial specifically evaluating PTX plus C after failure of first-line pembrolizumab-based therapy in patients with R/M SCCHN. The observed clinical activity and tolerability support this widely available regimen as a potential standard-of-care option in the absence of randomized evidence in this setting.</description>

We aim to explore the effect of tobacco cessation on the risk of buccal mucosa cancer (BMC). A case-control study was conducted across five cancer centres in India. We enrolled 2320 BMC and 2302 frequency-matched controls. Information was collected on smoking and chewing (products, duration and quitting). Unconditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the effect of tobacco cessation compared to current users, after adjusting for potential confounders. For both smoking and chewing, the odds reduced rapidly after 5 years of quitting, so that those who had quit smoking ≥10 years ago had only 0.39 (95% CI 0.28-0.54) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to smoke, and those who quit chewing ≥10 years ago had 0.58 (95% CI 0.43-0.81) the odds of BMC compared to those who continued to chew. Chewing with areca nut was associated with almost double the risk of chewing without (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.53-2.26) but the rate of reduction of risk with quitting was similar. These findings show clearly the benefits of quitting and inform policies that emphasize chewing tobacco cessation, given its widespread prevalence in India.</description>

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the survival impact of ENE in HNSCC and identified global research trends relevant to this research field through a complementary bibliometric analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ScienceDirect, PubMed, and Scopus were systematically searched during 2000-2025. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. A Scopus-based bibliometric analysis was conducted using the Biblioshiny package of R to identify and map the publication trends, influential authors, and major institutional contributions between 2010 and 2025. RESULTS: Of the 839 retrieved records, 711 studies were screened, and 16 studies comprising approximately 3900 patients met all inclusion criteria. The bibliometric analysis of 120 Scopus-indexed publications demonstrated a marked increase in ENE-related research from 2015 onward, driven primarily by institutions in Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea. Keyword mapping indicated expanding intersections of ENE research with radiomics, prognostic modelling, and refinement of staging systems. Meta-analysis confirmed a significant association between ENE and adverse survival outcomes. Subgroup analyses showed consistently poor prognostic implications across both pathologic and radiologic ENE assessments. CONCLUSION: ENE in cervical lymph node metastases is an independent and strong predictor of adverse survival in HNSCC. The increasing global attention to ENE highlights its crucial role in multidisciplinary oncologic management. Therefore, standardized pathological and imaging-based assessment of ENE is essential for developing superior prognostic models and optimizing future treatment planning strategies.</description>

The purpose of this study is to perform the first meta-analysis examining intraoperative margin assessment methods in OCSCC with the goal of determining if there is a significant difference in patient outcomes between specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. REVIEW METHODS: Studies met inclusion criteria if they conducted intraoperative specimen-driven and tumor bed-driven margin analysis in patients with OCSCC and reported patient outcomes. Random effects meta-analyses were used to analyze the compiled data. RESULTS: The literature search returned 1988 articles for initial review of which 9 (1240 participants) met criteria for inclusion and meta-analysis. Meta-analysis revealed that a specimen-based approach is associated with higher intraoperative re-resection rate (P &lt; .05), significantly lower final positive margin rate (P &lt; .05), and decreased local recurrence when compared to the tumor bed-based approach (P &lt; .05). However, there was no significant difference in overall recurrence when comparing intraoperative margin analysis methods (P &gt; .05). Additionally, none of the included studies noted a significant difference in survival outcomes between tumor bed versus specimen-based methods. CONCLUSION: Specimen-based frozen margin analysis in OCSCC results in lower false negative rates and improved local control; however, there is no significant difference in overall recurrence or survival when comparing specimen-based vs tumor bed-based techniques.</description>

Given the elusive results in the literature, clarifying whether older patients face different thyroidectomy safety profiles is crucial for optimizing risk assessment and patient counseling. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between older age (age ≥65 years) and thyroidectomy safety by comparing endocrine-related complications, including recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, hematoma, and mortality in older compared with younger patients. DATA SOURCES: Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, Ovid Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to May 29, 2025; only English-language studies were included. STUDY SELECTION: Cohort studies comparing thyroidectomy outcomes between older and younger patients and reporting endocrine-related complications were included. Two independent reviewers screened abstracts and full texts. Of 3192 studies identified, 11 met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers extracted data following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Risk of bias across studies was evaluated using the ROBINS-I (Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions) tool. Random-effects models were used to pool data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incidence of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hypocalcemia, and hematoma; odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were calculated. RESULTS: The analysis included 11 studies with a total of 427 886 patients of whom 104 232 (24.4%) were older adults (≥65 years). Older adults had greater odds of overall recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (2.3% vs 1.0%; OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.16; I2 = 76%), hematoma (2.4% vs 1.0%; OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.70-3.16; I2 = 0%), and mortality at last follow-up (0.3% vs 0.01%; OR, 11.09; 95% CI, 1.77-69.52; I2 = 90%) compared with younger patients. However, rates of overall hypocalcemia (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-1.05; I2 = 71%) and wound complications (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.92-2.06; I2 = 0%) were similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that thyroidectomy is safe in older patients, with only small absolute increases in recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, hematoma, and mortality despite statistical significance. These findings support individualized counseling and perioperative planning while acknowledging the overall safety of thyroidectomy in this population.</description>

Our goal was to perform a large multicentre evaluation of WPOI as a prognostic marker in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Retrospective pathology data was collated from 14 institutions and compared with clinical outcome in 1374 OSCC patients with upfront curative resection. Most cases were of oral tongue (n = 645, 47%); T2 (33%) and N0 (59%). WPOI 1-3 frequency was 29.4%, WPOI 4 47% and WPOI 5 22%. On univariable analysis, the 3-year disease free survival (DFS) was 54.2% for WPOI 5 vs. 69.7% for WPOI 1-4 (p &lt; 0.001). The locoregional control (LRC) was 68.9% vs 79.2% (p = 0.001), and overall survival (OS) 68.4% vs 83.8% (p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable Cox-regression in the entire cohort, WPOI 4 or 5 was strongly correlated with other known poor prognostic factors and not an independent predictor of OS (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.92-1.52), LRC or DFS. However, in early-stage (pT1-2 N0) patients treated with surgery alone without adjuvant radiotherapy, WPOI 5 was a robust independent predictor of DFS (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.54-12.32, p = 0.006), OS (HR 3.69, 95% CI 1.23-11.1, p = 0.020) and LRC (HR 3.52, 95% CI 2.13-5.82, p &lt;0.001) after applying inverse probability weighting to correct for selection bias. Furthermore, in the entire cohort of early-stage patients, interaction modeling showed that adjuvant radiotherapy significantly reduces the risk for both DFS and LRC for those with WPOI-5 (Interaction p = 0.002). Therefore, it may act as a predictive biomarker for the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. The prognostic and predictive role of WPOI-5 should be validated in prospective trials.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective analysis with over 3500 patients and explores a novel approach using deep learning and dosiomics to predict radiation-induced injury, which could have important clinical implications in managing nasopharyngeal carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Wang L, Li Y, Qiu T, Liu J, Zhou J, Gao H, Yu H, Zhu Y, Sun B, Yang G, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; BMC cancer | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1186/s12885-026-15599-x'&gt;10.1186/s12885-026-15599-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-28&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41652361/'&gt;41652361&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: To investigate the potential of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map-based deep learning and dose distribution-based dosiomics in predicting radiation-induced temporal lobe injury (RTLI) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 3578 NPC patients from Jiangsu Cancer Hospital receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Ninety-four RTLI patients were recruited based on inclusion criteria and matched 1:1 with 97 control subjects using propensity scores. Patients were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 135) and the validation cohort (n = 59). Deep transfer learning (DTL) features and dosiomics features were extracted from ADC map and three-dimensional dose distribution, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression were employed to identify predictive features. Subsequently, eight machine learning classification models were trained to establish a prediction framework, encompassing Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Extremely Randomized Trees, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, Adaptive Boosting and Multilayer Perceptron. The performance of clinical, DTL, dosiomics and feature fusion model was compared by the area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We constructed six pre-trained transfer learning networks and extracted DTL features, respectively. The results showed that pre-trained WideResNet 101 exhibited superior performance with an AUC of 0.786 in the validation cohort. The clinical model based on D1cc and induction chemotherapy demonstrated an AUC of 0.794 and the dosiomics model demonstrated an AUC of 0.903. Features fusion model demonstrated the highest AUC values in both the training (0.988) and validation (0.940) cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: The fusion model based on pretreatment ADC map and dose distribution provided a promising way to predict RTLI in NPC patients receiving IMRT, which can support clinicians in making decisions to develop individualized treatment plans and implement preventive measures.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multi-institutional retrospective study with a large cohort of 3928 patients provides important insights into the risk factors for mandibular osteoradionecrosis, which could influence clinical practice, although it does not present a randomized controlled trial or novel therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Humbert-Vidan L, Hansen CR, Petit S, Muñoz-Montplet C, Hueniken K, Mohamed ASR, Saunders DP, Patel V, Verduijn GM, Heemsbergen WD, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.044'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.044&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41642169/'&gt;41642169&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is a severe late complication affecting patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) treated with radiation therapy (RT) that significantly impacts patients' quality of life and can require costly interventions. Although radiation dose is a key factor, other clinical and demographic risk factors also influence ORN development. Previous predictive models have primarily been single-institutional, limiting their generalizability. In this first analysis from the PREDMORN Consortium, we have aimed to reproduce existing statistical association and modeling analyses on the largest and most diverse mandibular ORN cohort worldwide to allow comparison with previous studies. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This retrospective multi-institutional study included 3928 patients with HNC (622 ORN cases) from 8 institutions. Clinical, demographic, and dosimetric variables were analyzed to develop a prediction model (any grade ORN vs no ORN) using forward stepwise logistic regression with correlation-based variable preselection. The ORN normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) model was developed on 80% of data from 6 institutions, tested on the remaining unseen 20%, and externally validated on a matched cohort (58 patients, 19 ORN cases) and a large population-based cohort (2687 patients, 215 ORN cases). RESULTS: Key predictors of ORN were D30%, V70Gy, pre-RT dental extractions, and smoking status. The ORN NTCP model demonstrated very good calibration on the population-based external cohort (Brier score, 0.077; Log Loss, 0.281). Model discrimination improved on a subcohort including oropharyngeal and locally advanced larynx/hypopharynx cancer cases only (AUC from 0.69 to 0.75 and from 0.65 to 0.67 on the matched and the population-based external cohorts, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The PREDMORN NTCP model is the largest multi-institutional effort to date aimed at predicting ORN risk in patients with HNC using real-world data. The model demonstrated good generalizability when externally validated to a large population-based cohort. Our observations align with current guidelines and corroborate findings from smaller single-institution studies.</description>

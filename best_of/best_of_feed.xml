      <description>&lt;h3&gt;🔥 CRITICAL - Score: 90/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial published in a top-tier journal (Lancet) that evaluates the addition of nivolumab to standard postoperative treatment for high-risk squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, with potential practice-changing implications for patient management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Bourhis J, Aupérin A, Borel C, Lefebvre G, Racadot S, Geoffrois L, Sun XS, Saada E, Cirauqui B, Rutkowski T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Lancet (London, England) | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1'&gt;10.1016/S0140-6736(25)01850-1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41448222/'&gt;41448222&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Postoperative cisplatin and radiotherapy is the standard of care for high-risk resected locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA-SCCHN). The NIVOPOST-OP trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of programmed death 1 blockade by nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in this setting. METHODS: This open-label, phase 3 trial evaluated adding nivolumab to cisplatin and radiotherapy after surgery for LA-SCCHN with high-risk pathological features. The main inclusion criteria were age 19-74 years, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-1, squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, or hypopharynx resected with macroscopic complete resection, and at least one high-risk pathological feature: nodal extracapsular extension, microscopically positive margins, four or more cervical nodal involvements without extracapsular extension, and multiple perineural invasions. 680 participants recruited in 82 sites across six countries (France, Spain, Poland, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland) were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive cisplatin and radiotherapy (66 Gy, cisplatin 100 mg/m2 intravenously once every 3 weeks, for three cycles); or nivolumab 240 mg intravenously, followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy with three cycles of concomitant nivolumab 360 mg once every 3 weeks, and six cycles of adjuvant nivolumab 480 mg once every 4 weeks. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival as per investigator assessment in the intention-to-treat population. 230 disease-free survival events (relapses or deaths) were required to detect a hazard ratio of 0·65 with 0·05 two-sided α error, with 90% power. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03576417) and is active, but not recruiting. FINDINGS: The 680 patients were recruited from Oct 15, 2018, to July 3, 2024. The analysis was based on 666 participants randomly assigned until the cutoff date (April 30, 2024), at which point the required number of events was reached (median follow-up 30·3 months). Disease-free survival was significantly improved with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy versus cisplatin and radiotherapy alone, irrespective of programmed death ligand 1 expression (HR 0·76; 95% CI 0·60-0·98; stratified log-rank test p value=0·034). There was an increase in the rate of participants with treatment-related grade 4 adverse events with nivolumab, cisplatin, and radiotherapy compared with cisplatin and radiotherapy (30 [10%] of 312 vs 16 [5%] of 306). Treatment-related deaths occurred in two participants in each group. INTERPRETATION: Nivolumab added to cisplatin and radiotherapy in high-risk resected LA-SCCHN improves disease-free survival with moderate toxic effect increase, and can be proposed as a new standard treatment.

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 85/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a randomized Phase II/III study evaluating a novel combination therapy in a significant patient population with recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer, which has the potential for practice-changing implications based on its design and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Rischin D, Hansen AR, Cohen EEW, Tahara M, Harrington KJ, Haddad RI, Licitra L, Mehanna H, Ferris RL, Koralewski P, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197'&gt;10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-25-1197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41427951/'&gt;41427951&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Feladilimab, an inducible T-cell co‑stimulatory receptor agonist, demonstrated clinical activity in combination with pembrolizumab in a Phase I head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) expansion cohort, prompting further evaluation in patients in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: INDUCE-3 (NCT04128696) was a randomized, double-blind, Phase II/III study in first-line programmed death-ligand 1-positive recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC patients. A 2-in-1 adaptive design was implemented, with an option to expand the Phase II study into a Phase III confirmatory study. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive feladilimab plus pembrolizumab or placebo plus pembrolizumab; up to 35 cycles of treatment for approximately 2 years. Primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The study enrolled 315 patients. Following review of unblinded interim data in 140 patients, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee recommended stopping patient accrual based on prespecified criteria. Existing patients discontinued feladilimab or placebo. Pembrolizumab treatment continued until prespecified stopping criteria were met. This study demonstrated no evidence of an effect in favor of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab, with an adjusted HR of 1.51 for OS and 1.40 for PFS (median OS: 44.1 weeks [95% confidence interval (CI): 35.9-NA]; median PFS: 10.1 weeks [95% CI: 9.1-15.0]) versus placebo plus pembrolizumab (median OS: not reached; median PFS: 16.0 weeks [95% CI: 14.3-26.1]). The incidence of treatment-related adverse events was higher in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis does not support the combination of feladilimab plus pembrolizumab due to lack of superiority over placebo plus pembrolizumab.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This paper presents international consensus recommendations on a critical aspect of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis, which could standardize practices and improve patient outcomes, but it lacks the robust evidence from trials or large studies typically associated with higher impact scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Gupta R, Fielder T, Bal M, Chiosea SI, Dahlstrom JE, Kakkar A, Kiss K, Laco J, Mittal N, Pasricha S, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; The Lancet.

There is considerable variation in the prevalence of histopathologically detected extranodal extension in comparable studies. The Head and Neck Cancer International Group, which includes 23 organisations managing patients with head and neck cancer, identified several challenges in evaluating histopathologically detected extranodal extension. Thus, the Head and Neck Consensus Language for Ease and Reproducibility (HN-CLEAR) and its global stakeholders prioritised developing diagnostic criteria and uniform terminology for histopathologically detected extranodal extension. The histopathologically detected extranodal extension working group established by WHO, International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting, American Joint Committee on Cancer, Union for International Cancer Control, North American Society of Head and Neck Pathology, and American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology committees undertook consensus deliberations using scanned whole slides and a PRISMA literature review-based scoping questionnaire. The guidelines were tested by 30 additional pathologists across six continents and strengthened with prescriptive diagnostic criteria and unifying terminology based on the inter-rater concordance analyses. This Review generates practically useful consensus diagnostic recommendations and aligned terminology for addressing the gaps in the histopathologically detected extranodal extension literature. The recommendations can be used globally and cater to all levels of medical resources, practices, and experiences, thus ensuring equitable patient care.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This large retrospective analysis of over 200,000 patients provides important insights into the survival impact of immunotherapy in advanced HNSCC, with significant findings regarding overall survival that could influence treatment approaches, though it lacks the rigor of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Vuppala R, Long S, Sharbel D, Weir F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70140'&gt;10.1002/hed.70140&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41450282/'&gt;41450282&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: We evaluated the association between immunotherapy (IO) and overall survival (OS) in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and examined outcomes by IO timing. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of national NCDB 2004-2022 United States adults with Stages III-IVB HNSCC. Exposure was any IO. The primary outcome was OS from diagnosis; analyses used multivariable Cox models, 24-month landmarking, and propensity methods. RESULTS: Among 221 116 patients (mean age: 62), 10 023 (4.5%) received IO. Median follow-up 37 months. IO was associated with lower mortality (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.89-0.94). Landmark analysis showed benefit 0-24 months (HR: 0.76; 0.74-0.79) that reversed thereafter (HR: 1.09; 1.04-1.14). By intent, median OS was 53.2 months (neoadjuvant), 50.1 months (adjuvant), 16.5 months (later-line), versus 60.7 months without IO. Propensity analyses attenuated effects (HR: ~1.00). CONCLUSIONS: In real-world advanced HNSCC, IO confers modest early benefit with varied long-term results; outcomes vary by timing. Prospective biomarker-stratified trials are needed.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a large retrospective analysis of over 1,700 patients and introduces an innovative AI-based approach to risk stratification in oropharyngeal carcinoma, which could have significant clinical implications, although it lacks the prospective design of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ye Z, Mojahed-Yazdi R, Zapaishchykova A, Tak D, Mahootiha M, Pardo JCC, Zielke J, Zha Y, Guthier C, Tishler RB, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-24-02679'&gt;10.1200/JCO-24-02679&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41435207/'&gt;41435207&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Extranodal extension (ENE) is a biomarker in oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) but can only be diagnosed via surgical pathology. We applied an automated artificial intelligence (AI) imaging platform integrating lymph node autosegmentation with ENE prediction to determine the prognostic value of the number of predicted ENE nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multisite, retrospective study of 1,733 OPC patients with pretreatment computed tomography who underwent definitive radiation therapy across three institutions. Malignant lymph nodes were segmented using a validated deep learning auto-segmentation model, and segmented lymph nodes were sequentially processed with a validated ENE prediction model to calculate number of nodes with AI-predicted ENE (AI-ENE) per patient. We evaluated associations of AI-ENE with disease outcomes using site-stratified, multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for human papillomavirus (HPV) status, smoking pack-years, tumor and nodal stage, age, and sex. We evaluated risk-stratification improvement when incorporating AI-ENE into the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)-0129 risk groupings and derived American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition staging with Uno C-indices and decision curve analyses. RESULTS: Overall, median AI-ENE node number was 1 (range, 0-6). AI-ENE node number was independently associated with poorer distant control (DC; hazard ratio [HR], 1.44 [95% CI, 1.23 to 1.69]; P &lt; .001) and overall survival (OS; HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.16 to 1.46]; P &lt; .001). Increasing AI-ENE node number was incrementally associated with worse outcome, particularly DC (P &lt; .001). C-indices improved in the external data set when incorporating AI-ENE into RTOG-0129 groupings (OS: 0.70 v 0.65; DC: 0.65 v 0.57) and AJCC-8 stage (OS: 0.75 v 0.70; DC: 0.72 v 0.67; P &lt; .001 for each). The largest improvements were observed among HPV-negative patients (C-index: +15% for OS, +14% for DC). CONCLUSION: Automated, AI-ENE node number is a novel risk factor for OPC that may better inform pretreatment risk stratification and decision-making.</description>

We aimed to propose an end-to-end deep learning framework called NPC-SurvAI to perform prognosis assessment using MRI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). METHODS: This retrospective study included 2180 NPC patients who underwent baseline MRI. The NPC-SurvAI comprised an AttVNet for image segmentation and a DenseNet-ICAM for prognosis evaluation, including progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The clinical model was built with age, T-stage, N-stage, and EBV DNA. The image and combined models were developed by the NPC-SurvAI framework. The integrated area under the curve (iAUC) and thetime-dependent AUC (tAUC) were leveraged to measure the predictive accuracy. K-means clustering and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were utilized to stratify patients into subtypes and compare their prognoses. RESULTS: In the validation cohorts, the AttVNet achieved average Dice similarity coefficients of 0.726-0.764 tumor segmentation. The dynamic change curves of the AUCs over time suggested that the combined model outperformed both the clinical and image models in predicting PFS (iAUC: 0.838-0.884 vs 0.788-0.844 vs 0.738-0.798) and OS (iAUC: 0.842-0.894 vs 0.793-0.853 vs 0.754-0.807) at any time point from 1 to 8 years. Specially, the combined model achieved time-AUCs of 0.844-0.930 for 3-year PFS and 0.827-0.896 for 5-year PFS; 0.838-0.978 for 3-year OS and 0.788-0.871 for 5-year OS. Additionally, patients could be stratified into two subtypes with different survivals (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: NPC-SurvAI has the potential to automatically stratify patients with diverse prognoses, which helps clinicians in optimizing treatment decisions and surveillance.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This meta-analysis addresses an important clinical question regarding patient-reported outcomes in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma, which can influence treatment decisions and shared decision-making, but it is based on comparative studies rather than a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; van Dijk SPJ, Blanco MMK, McMullin JL, Gazelle GS, Jalali MS, Chhatwal J, Gartland RM, Husson O, Hu Y, Swan JS, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4670'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4670&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41452620/'&gt;41452620&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Given the favorable prognosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC), treatment decisions increasingly rely on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), such as health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Comparative HRQOL data between active surveillance, thermal ablation, and surgery remain limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare HRQOL among adults with PTMC undergoing active surveillance, thermal ablation, or surgery to inform shared decision-making. DATA SOURCES: Embase, MEDLINE via Ovid, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the top 100 references of Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 17, 2025. STUDY SELECTION: Eligible studies included adult patients with PTMC and compared at least 2 relevant interventions while reporting PROs. Studies restricted to noncomparative designs or non-PTMC populations were excluded. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, resolving discrepancies with a third reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: This systematic review followed PRISMA 2020 and PRISMA-S guidelines; the meta-analysis adhered to MOOSE guidelines. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer and independently verified by a second. Study quality was assessed using established critical appraisal checklists. Random-effects models were applied to obtain mean differences with 95% CIs. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was domain-specific HRQOL (eg, voice problems, neuromuscular symptoms, psychological distress), as measured using the Thyroid Cancer Quality of Life (THYCA-QOL), Korean Thyroid-specific Quality of Life (KT-QOL), and other validated instruments. RESULTS: Of 988 retrieved records, 13 studies comprising 5793 patients were included: 2356 underwent active surveillance, 242 received thermal ablation (211 radiofrequency, 31 laser), and 3195 underwent surgery (2350 lobectomy, 833 total thyroidectomy, 12 unspecified). Active surveillance was consistently associated with better PROs compared with surgery across thyroid-specific domains, including neuromuscular symptoms, voice problems, concentration issues, psychological distress, sympathetic complaints, feelings of being chilly, and scar-related concerns. Generic instruments (eg, 36-item Short Form Health Survey, version 2) supported these findings. Low-certainty evidence indicated that thermal ablation was associated with better HRQOL than surgery after 3 to 6 months, although these differences diminished by 12 months. Across studies, heterogeneity arose from differences in treatment strategies and comparators, outcome instruments and duration of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that patients whose PTMC was managed with active surveillance reported equal or better HRQOL than those undergoing surgery. These findings support the importance of incorporating PROs into shared decision-making for low-risk thyroid cancer.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset (n=2426) from the SEER database to analyze the necessity of neck dissection in T1N0M0 OTSCC, providing important insights into treatment decisions, though it is a retrospective analysis rather than a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Yuan Z, Zhao Y, Ming H, Zhang X, Tan X&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral diseases | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1111/odi.70170'&gt;10.1111/odi.70170&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-25&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41449832/'&gt;41449832&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To identify T1N0M0 oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) patient subgroups benefiting most from neck dissection (ND) based on the SEER database. METHODS: Patients with T1N0M0 OTSCC were identified from the SEER database. Propensity score-matching (PSM) was utilized to balance baseline characteristics between ND and non-ND groups. Survival differences between these groups were compared using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) analysis and log-rank tests. Additionally, a multivariable Cox regression model was applied to the pre-matched cohort to identify independent prognostic factors. RESULTS: In total, 2426 cases were included. In the multivariable model adjusted for key prognosticators, ND was an independent factor associated with significantly improved OS and DSS. After PSM, 1702 well-balanced patients were analyzed. Subgroup analyses based on tumor characteristics revealed that favorable survival outcomes associated with ND were predominantly observed in patients with tumor sizes 11-20 mm and those with moderate or poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with small tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, survival outcomes were comparable between the ND and observation groups. CONCLUSION: ND was associated with improved survival for T1N0M0 OTSCC patients with 11-20 mm tumors and moderate/poor/undifferentiated differentiation. For patients with smaller tumors (1-10 mm) or well-differentiated histology, the observation strategy had demonstrated survival benefits comparable to ND.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review includes a large number of participants (over 7.4 million) and addresses an important epidemiological question regarding the association between air pollution and laryngeal cancer, which has potential clinical implications, although it is not a randomized controlled trial or a primary study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Soopramanien J, Mittal S, Jadeja K, Soni L, Saghir S, Mannan F&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer epidemiology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981'&gt;10.1016/j.canep.2025.102981&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2025-Dec-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41442908/'&gt;41442908&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ambient air pollution is a major global health concern, yet its association with laryngeal cancer remains poorly defined. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to outdoor air pollutants and incidence of laryngeal cancer. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS were conducted from inception to 01/06/2024. Eligible studies included observational and ecological designs reporting quantitative associations between ambient pollutants and laryngeal cancer incidence. Study quality, risk of bias, and evidence certainty graded were appraised using the NIH tool, National Toxicology Program framework and GRADE approach respectively. A total of nine studies (4 ecological, 5 cohort) comprising over 7.4 million participants were included. Each pollutant was analysed by a maximum of 3 studies. Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) demonstrated the most consistent association with laryngeal cancer, with hazard ratios between 1.18 and 1.24 per 10 μg/m³ increase. One large cohort reported a significant relationship between particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM₂.₅) and laryngeal cancer (HR 1.85; 95 % CI: 1.2-2.85), while findings across other pollutants, including PM₁₀, SO₂, O₃, CO, and NOₓ, were inconsistent. Although data remain limited, emerging evidence suggests that chronic exposure to ambient NO₂ and PM₂.₅ may increase laryngeal cancer risk. Future large-scale prospective cohort studies with standardized exposure metrics and robust confounding control are needed to better characterise this relationship. Natural experiments in regions undergoing major air-quality policy changes can provide valuable evidence on the impact of reducing exposure on laryngeal cancer incidence at a population level.</description>

Single-institutional and multi-institutional retrospective studies, as well as population-level databases, suggest that clinical differences exist among gnathic OS and OS of other sides, including other craniofacial OS. To date, no specific prospective studies of gnathic OS have been reported, and aspects of clinical management are controversial. Some elements of care are aligned with extragnathic OS, e.g., margin negative (R0) surgery, whereas others, such as chemotherapy and radiation, are not clearly defined. The authors reviewed the available literature for the diagnosis, treatment, and supportive/survivorship care patients with gnathic OS and offer consensus statements for the comprehensive management of this rare disease.</description>

We sought to identify clinical and sociodemographic factors associated with sustained attendance at an HNC Survivorship Clinic. METHODS: Our retrospective cohort of 625 HNC patients was divided into a subset of patients who received radiotherapy (n = 510) and patients who did not (n = 115). We defined sustained attendance as 1) the total number of visits that occurred before completing treatment and within three years post-treatment, and 2) adherence scores, calculated as the number of timeframes during which at least one visit occurred: pre-treatment completion (for the radiotherapy subset only) and one-, two-, and three-years post-treatment. We used Fisher's exact test for descriptive statistics and Poisson regression to estimate prevalence ratios (PRs) for sustained attendance. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, 248 patients (39.7%) had only one visit to the Survivorship Clinic. In the radiotherapy subset, 211 patients (41.4%) had an adherence score of 1, compared to 81 (70.4%) in the non-radiotherapy subset. In adjusted analysis, treatment with radiotherapy was associated with more total visits (PR: 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.19-1.68), while greater neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation (PR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97) and farther distance from the Clinic (PR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.69-0.95) were associated with fewer total visits. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and sociodemographic factors are independently associated with sustained attendance at an HNC Survivorship Clinic. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Disparities in engagement with HNC survivorship care highlight the need for targeted interventions to improve adherence to follow-up recommendations.</description>

Over the last decade, the aim to get a deeper understanding of how early experiences influence behavior later in life has led to an increased popularity of epigenetic studies. Several studies focused on negative childhood experiences, increased methylation at different oxytocin receptor gene sites, and deficits in social behavior in adolescence or adulthood. The current study focused on the role of parental behavior, personality, and methylation of the MT2 region in the oxytocin receptor gene on insecure attachment styles in young adulthood. A total number of N = 71 students (55 females, one non-binary) completed an online survey and provided cell material (buccal cell swaps) for methylation analysis. Parental behavior was measured with the Parental Bonding Instrument (PBI), personality with the NEO Five-Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and adult attachment with the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). Results showed a moderating effect of neuroticism on the relation between maternal care and methylation of the MT2 region: higher maternal care was associated with lower methylation levels but only among participants with low neuroticism scores. No association of methylation with anxious or avoidant attachment was observed and no effect of paternal care at all. The results emphasize the model of early environmental influences on behavior in respect to changing gene activity and will be discussed with respect to the MT2 region and early life experiences on the one, and the association with personality on the other hand.</description>

This study aimed to compute and evaluate medication adherence in its three process phases among T2D patients treated with oral antidiabetic (OAD) medications assessing association with main clinical outcomes. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included newly diagnosed T2D patients initiating OAD therapy within 2015-2019 identified from the Nivel Primary Care Database (Nivel-PCD) in the Netherlands. Initiation was operationalised as ≥2 OAD prescriptions within follow-up. Implementation was quantified monthly using the Continuous Multiple-interval Measure of Medication Availability (CMA9). Group-based trajectory modelling (k-means via AdhereR) identified adherence patterns over 12 months. Persistence was assessed with a permissible-gap rule on the same 12-month series. Clinical measures (HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI) were evaluated at baseline and at 12 months, and HbA1c trends were analysed over time. RESULTS: Among 3,404 T2D patients started an OAD treatment, four distinct adherence clusters were identified: perfect adherence (70.1%), slow decline (13.3%), low adherence (10.6%), and slow increase (6.0%). Overall initiation was 99%. One-year persistence ranged from 26% (low adherence group) to 98.8% (perfect adherence group). Patients in the perfect-adherence group had higher baseline HbA1c but showed lower HbA1c and LDL levels over time compared with other groups. Blood pressure improved slightly in all groups. Changes in BMI were minimal. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence trajectories provide a dynamic view of patients' behaviour and are associated with better glycaemic and lipid control. High-risk patients were often in the perfect-adherence group and appeared to gain the highest clinical benefit. These results support routine adherence monitoring and targeted, trajectory-informed interventions in T2D care.</description>

We therefore investigated the association between childhood and adolescent factors and subsequent DTC incidence in women. METHODS: We used data from 47,913 women enrolled (2003-2009) in the U.S. nationwide Sister Study cohort who were cancer-free at baseline. We used Cox regression models to assess associations of DTC incidence with self-reported baseline characteristics, including perceived body size, hormonal, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors through age 20, adjusting for attained age (timescale), and race/ethnicity. RESULTS: Over follow-up (median: 13.1 years), 239 DTC cases were identified. Factors associated with higher DTC incidence included being taller than peers at age 10 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.89), being lighter (HR = 1.37, 95%CI = 0.97-1.91) or heavier (HR = 1.28, 95%CI = 0.96-1.71) than peers during teen years, and ever not having enough to eat during childhood (HR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.15-2.43). DTC incidence was lower among those with childhood higher household educational level (HRBachelor's degree or higher vs high school, GED or less = 0.75, 95%CI = 0.55-1.03). We did not find notable associations for other factors. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that childhood growth, nutrition, and socioeconomic factors may influence DTC incidence in women.</description>

This prospective, pilot implementation study evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and potential clinical effectiveness of a novel student-led tele-EMST program for HNC survivors. METHODOLOGY: HNC survivors (n = 13) completed an eight-week tele-EMST program. Acceptability was measured using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability Questionnaire (TFAQ) and the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). Feasibility was tracked weekly. Swallowing performance, airway clearance, and quality of life were evaluated using the Timed Water Swallow Test (TWST), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), and SWAL-QoL, respectively. Data were collected with REDCap. Descriptive and non-parametric statistics were performed. RESULTS: Acceptability of the tele-EMST program was high, as evidenced by high ratings on the TUQ (mean: 88.1/100%, SD: 16.3) and significant improvement on the TFAQ (p &lt; 0.05). Technical issues occurred in 24% of sessions but were all resolved. Swallowing performance (TWST, p &lt; 0.05), self-reported dysphagia symptoms, and mental health scores (SWAL-QoL, p = 0.03; p = 0.02) significantly improved. No significant changes in PEFR were observed (p = 0.59). CONCLUSION: The findings of this small pilot feasibility suggest that a student-led, tele-EMST program is a promising, scalable approach to reduce treatment inequities and support survivorship care for HNC survivors with dysphagia.</description>

While high-volume facilities (HVFs) enhance surgical outcomes, their survival benefit in ES-OCSCC has not been assessed in an updated large cohort. The role of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predicting survival in this context is not well described. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed stage I and II OCSCC patients from the National Cancer Database between 2004 and 2020. Facilities were categorized by case volume into low-(&lt;2 cases/year), medium-(2-10), and high-volume (&gt;10). Hazards ratios estimated the impact of facility volume on OS, adjusting for clinical/surgical factors, and SDOH. Kaplan-Meier survival curves compared OS. RESULTS: Among 22,258 patients with ES-OSCC, 42.55% were treated at HVFs. PSMs rates were higher at LVFs (T1: 7.16%, T2: 13.63%) and MVFs (T1: 4.33%, T2: 7.56%) compared with HVFs (T1: 2.89%, T2: 4.74%). Treatment at LVFs was associated with higher odds of PSMs (OR = 2.8; 95% CI: 2.34-3.37, p &lt; 0.001). Five-year OS was highest at HVFs (80.2%), followed by MVFs (77.1%) and LVFs (70.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Survival remained worse at LVF/MVFs among those with negative surgical margins (NSMs) or PSMs receiving RT/CRT. SDOH, including government insurance (OR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.27-3.17, p = 0.002) and proximity to treatment facility (OR = 1.28; 95% CI: 1.06-1.56, p = 0.01) increased PSM risk, while higher income (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.6-0.97, p = 0.03) was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Facility volume and SDOH influence PSM rates and OS in ES-OCSCC. Patients treated at HVFs experienced better outcomes, emphasizing the need for improved surgical quality metrics and centralization of care, even for ES-OCSCC.</description>

A total of 263 dentists from public and private institutions in Ankara, Türkiye, participated in the survey, which included a content-validated 36-item questionnaire covering demographic data, examination habits, knowledge of lesion features, biopsy practices, and educational experience. The data were analyzed via descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations to explore associations between professional characteristics and clinical behaviors. While 78% of the participants acknowledged the dentist's role in reducing oral cancer mortality, only 17.5% reported performing routine oral cancer screenings. Biopsy practice was limited, with only 11% indicating that they had ever performed a biopsy, and 36.9% preferred to monitor lesions instead of referring them immediately. Experienced dentists were significantly more likely to examine their lymph nodes (p = 0.006) and conduct routine screenings (p &lt; 0.001). Although tobacco and alcohol use are widely recognized as risk factors, only 27.7% of the participants routinely examined high-risk anatomical areas. Patient education was reported by 92.4% of the participants, but brochures and visual aids were rarely used. Fewer than one-third of the participants rated their undergraduate training on oral cancer as sufficient, and most supported mandatory continuing education. The findings reveal considerable gaps in dentists' preparedness and implementation of early detection strategies despite high awareness levels. Strengthening diagnostic education in undergraduate programs and promoting structured continuing education may improve early detection efforts and reduce oral cancer-related morbidity and mortality.</description>

Nasogastric tube is an easy, efficient, and cost-effective method of management that could be a key to minimizing deaths from diarrheal disease. As such, this study assessed the current practices and barriers toward using nasogastric tube for managing moderate to severe dehydration in under-five children. PURPOSE: To assess the practices and barriers toward the management of moderate to severe dehydration using nasogastric tube in under-five children among health centers in Gamo Zone, South Ethiopia. METHODS: A qualitative study design was conducted among healthcare professionals at selected health centers in Gamo Zone. Data about the practice pattern of managing moderate to severe dehydration and barriers toward nasogastric tube utilization were obtained via in-depth interview. Data were reviewed using constant comparative analysis to identify emerging themes, and axial coding was performed to make connections between categories to organize themes into causal relationships. Hypotheses and concepts were developed inductively from the data. RESULTS: In our study, of thirty participants, 21 (70.0%) correctly diagnosed severe dehydration, while 9 (30.0%) diagnosed moderate dehydration. Among those who diagnosed severe dehydration, 5 (23.8%) recommended intravenous resuscitation, and 16 (76.2%) chose oral rehydration. After being informed of failed attempts, four chose to refer, and one clinician remained fixed on intravenous resuscitation, while the remaining 16 clinicians opted for nasogastric tube. Major challenges mentioned by the participants in managing dehydration were late presentation of the patients and equipment shortage. CONCLUSION: Participants in our study were aware of the significance of nasogastric tube for the treatment of moderate to severe dehydration. However, a gap in clinical skills, a lack of continuous training, high clinician turnover, and institutional policies limiting nasogastric tube utilization for the management of dehydration were major challenges. Therefore, improving clinicians' skills through continuous training and improving management protocol is essential in ensuring safe and effective rehydration and better patient outcomes.</description>

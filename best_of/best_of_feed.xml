      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis includes a substantial number of studies and a large patient cohort, providing important insights into oncologic outcomes of TORS for HPV-associated OPSCC, which could influence clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cheung MH, Kim CH, Nguyen SA, Williamson L, Kejner A, Bobian M, Newman JG&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70101'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70101&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41521853/'&gt;41521853&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To define survival and recurrence outcomes of HPV associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) following transoral robotic surgery (TORS). DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed on studies employing TORS in HPV-associated OPSCC. Meta-analysis of continuous measures, proportions, and comparison of weighted proportion and relative risk were performed for patient characteristics and outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 58 studies, comprising 16,129 adults treated with TORS for OPSCC, were included. The mean age was 59.5 years (SD 2.08) (range 18-93), with an average follow-up of 43.4 months (SD 13.36); 83.5% of the cohort was male, and 85.6% had HPV-positive OPSCC. In the HPV-positive group, TORS survival rates were 91.0% at 1 year, 94.9% at 3 years, and 89.8% at 5 years. In comparison, the HPV-negative group had survival rates of 92.3%, 84.2%, and 72.9%, respectively. Significant survival differences were observed between cohorts at 3 and 5 years (P &lt; .0001). The HPV-positive group had a significantly higher likelihood of 5-year overall survival compared to the HPV-negative group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.05-1.34) Recurrence rates in HPV-positive patients were 2.0% local, 3.1% regional, and 5.3% locoregional, whereas HPV-negative patients had recurrence rates of 7.6% local, 6.0% regional, and 9.1% locoregional (P = .0037, .2143, .426, respectively). Distant metastasis rates were 5.6% in HPV-positive and 10.2% in HPV-negative patients (P = .0033). CONCLUSION: The higher survival rates and lower recurrences in HPV-positive OPSCC patients compared to their HPV-negative counterparts reflects the favorable long-term oncologic outcome seen in HPV-associated OPSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This prospective matched cohort study compares two radiotherapy techniques in a significant sample size (n=180) and addresses an important clinical question regarding auditory preservation in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which has implications for treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lien KH, Lin CY, Chen PY, Chang JT, Chen TY, Hung SP, Lee CH, Yap WK, Hsieh CE, Hsu CL, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70113'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70113&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-08&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41503873/'&gt;41503873&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: To compare cochlear dose and hearing outcomes between intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective matched cohorts. SETTING: Tertiary academic center. METHODS: A total of 180 newly diagnosed, treatment-naive NPC patients receiving definitive radiotherapy between 2023 and 2025 were enrolled. Patients were 1:1 matched by sex, age, and disease stage, and assigned to IMPT (n = 90) or VMAT (n = 90). Mean cochlear dose was recorded. Audiological evaluations, including pure-tone audiometry (PTA), air-bone gap, and word recognition score, were performed before and after treatment. RESULTS: IMPT delivered significantly lower mean doses to the ipsilateral (47.51 vs 56.82 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -14.27 to -4.35) and contralateral cochlea (30.79 vs 45.71 Gy, P &lt; .001; 95% CI: -18.93 to -10.91). Based on each patient's most recent audiometric assessment (median follow-up, 12.1 months; range, 7.5-19.5 months), IMPT demonstrated better average PTA thresholds than VMAT (33.72 vs 42.00 dB; P = .016; 95% CI, -14.91 to -1.65), superior high-frequency hearing at 2 to 8 kHz (37.94 vs 53.82 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -23.69 to -8.07), lower air-bone gap (5.67 vs 10.62 dB; P &lt; .001; 95% CI, -6.80 to -3.10), and higher word recognition scores (96.67% vs 94.00%; P = .039; 95% CI, 0.14-5.20), with less bone conduction loss at 1 to 4 kHz. CONCLUSION: IMPT reduces cochlear dose compared to VMAT, resulting in better hearing preservation and suggesting its potential to minimize ototoxicity in NPC patients.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This is a prospective phase 2 trial evaluating a novel combination therapy in a challenging patient population with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory head and neck cancer, which may provide important insights and clinical implications, although it lacks the robustness of a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; So J, Droznin A, Tiwari P, Chen YH, Chau N, Margalit DN, Tishler RB, Hanna GJ, Mak RH, Fitzgerald K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.043'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.043&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520892/'&gt;41520892&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, feasibility, and clinical efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) combined with pembrolizumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who progressed on prior PD-1 inhibitor therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: This prospective, non-randomized phase II trial enrolled patients with PD-1 inhibitor-refractory R/M HNSCC. In Cohort A, a single lesion was treated with SBRT while other sites were left unirradiated. In Cohort B, all known oligometastatic lesions were treated with SBRT. Pembrolizumab was administered every 3 weeks in both cohorts. The primary endpoint was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS). Correlative immune analyses were performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells using mass cytometry and TCRβ sequencing. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were treated (6 in Cohort A, 12 in Cohort B). Median PFS was 1.8 months in Cohort A and 5.7 months in Cohort B. The 3-month PFS rate was 17% (1/6) in Cohort A and 67% (8/12) in Cohort B, with an overall response rate of 25% (3/12) in Cohort B and no objective responses in Cohort A. Median OS was 7.6 months (95% CI: [0.7-32.9])in Cohort A and 10.1 months (95% CI: [5.8-49.7]) in Cohort B. In Cohort B there were 2 (2/12, 17%) Grade 4 toxicities observed in the setting of re-irradiation. Correlative studies showed that patients with PFS &gt;3 months had higher baseline frequencies of CD8+ central memory T cells and elevated CXCR5 expression on memory B cells. CONCLUSIONS: In anti PD-1-refractory R/M HNSCC, SBRT with pembrolizumab was safe and feasible, suggesting activity when all progressing lesions were treated. Immune profiling describes pre-existing memory T and B cell phenotypes that appear to correlate with treatment benefit. These findings support further study and clinical use of comprehensive SBRT plus PD-1 blockade in this hard-to-treat population.</description>

However, data on treatment-specific outcomes remain limited. METHODS: We analyzed the National Cancer Database (NCDB) for all SNSCC cases diagnosed between 2010 and 2017 with available HPV testing data. Prognostically significant variables were identified via multivariable Cox regression. Propensity score-matched cohorts were then created, matching HPV-positive and HPV-negative patients exactly by treatment modality and other significant prognostic factors. The association between HPV status and 5-year OS was assessed across treatment strategies. RESULTS: A total of 1697 HPV-tested SNSCC cases were identified; 551 (32.5%) were HPV+. Multivariable Cox regression showed that HPV status, age, comorbidity score, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, stage, and surgical margin status were significantly associated with outcomes. Within the propensity score-matched cohort, HPV positivity was significantly associated with improved OS among patients treated with chemoradiation (HR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.35-0.87, p = 0.01). No survival benefit was observed in patients treated with surgery alone (HR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.35-2.04, p = 0.71), surgery with radiation (HR = 1.38; 95% CI = 0.64-3.02, p = 0.41), radiation alone (HR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.11-1.41, p = 0.16), or in the combined group of these three treatment strategies (HR = 0.97; 95% CI = 0.57-1.62, p = 0.90). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that HPV+ SNSCC may be particularly sensitive to chemoradiation. Routine HPV testing may be warranted to investigate if tailored treatment approaches focusing on chemoradiation may benefit patients with HPV+ SNSCC.</description>

Its prognostic role in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), however, remains unclear. METHODS: Genome-wide 5hmC profiling was conducted using 5hmC-Seal sequencing on cfDNA from 174 newly diagnosed NPC patients. Patients were randomly assigned to training (n = 105) and test (n = 69) sets. Differential analysis was performed by survival outcome, EBV status, and tumor stage. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoint was event-free survival (EFS). A prognostic score based on a seven-gene 5hmC signature was developed using LASSO-Cox regression in the training set and validated in the test cohort. A nomogram integrating the 5hmC score, tumor stage, and EBV status was constructed. Model performance was assessed via Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, time-dependent ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). RESULTS: Marked 5hmC differences were detected between survivors and non-survivors. The 5hmC score stratified OS with AUCs of 0.83 (3-year) and 0.87 (5-year) in the training set and 0.78 (3-year) and 0.80 (5-year) in the test set, and remained predictive across EBV and stage subgroups. The integrated nomogram demonstrated robust calibration and offered the greatest net clinical benefit in DCA, with a 5-year C-index of 0.796. CONCLUSIONS: cfDNA 5hmC profiling enables noninvasive prognostic risk stratification in NPC. The proposed model may support personalized treatment planning and long-term management.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large dataset to explore age-related risk stratification in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which could inform treatment de-intensification strategies, but it is based on retrospective data and does not present novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhang C, Cheng Z, Jiang X, Zhao G, Zhu Y, Hou B, Sun Y, Liang S, Zhang Y, Wang Z, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70167'&gt;10.1002/hed.70167&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41525711/'&gt;41525711&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Although the AJCC eighth edition staging system incorporates HPV status, it remains insufficient to guide personalized treatment in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC). This study aimed to identify the optimal age threshold and evaluate its association with overall survival (OS) to improve risk stratification and inform individualized treatment strategies. METHODS: Data were extracted from the SEER database (2018-2021), the University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, and the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (NCC). Only HPV-positive OPC cases with complete survival records were included. The optimal age threshold was identified using restricted cubic spline modeling in combination with a recursive partitioning approach. Prognostic factors beyond HPV status and AJCC eighth edition stage were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was used to construct a risk stratification model. The primary endpoint was OS. RESULTS: Of the 10 283 eligible patients (87.9% male; median age, 62 years), 2.7% had distant metastases at diagnosis. Restricted cubic spline analysis revealed that 62 years of age represents an important critical threshold. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed that patients younger than 62 years exhibited significantly improved OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70; p &lt; 0.001). RPA stratified patients into five risk groups with distinct 2-year OS: extremely low (96.8%), low (93.7%), intermediate (86.1%), high (74.6%), and extremely high risk (47.5%). Among patients classified in the extremely low-risk group (T0-2N0-1M0 and younger than 62 years), no significant difference in OS was observed between those treated with radiotherapy alone and those treated with chemoradiotherapy. External validation in the UHN (N = 843) and NCC (N = 167) cohorts suggested that extremely low-risk patients might be spared concurrent chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This study developed a risk stratification model for patients with p16-positive OPC based on the AJCC eighth edition staging and age. Patients in the extremely low-risk group may derive limited benefit from concurrent chemotherapy, suggesting that its omission could be considered in selected patients and may help guide the design of future de-escalation trials.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large retrospective cohort from the SEER database to analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma, providing important insights into incidence trends and prognostic factors, though it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings characteristic of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Cao YD, Sun HW, Zha CP, Wang ZH, Sun CZ&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w'&gt;10.1007/s00405-025-09990-w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-12&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41524932/'&gt;41524932&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: This study aimed to comprehensively analyze salivary gland secretory carcinoma (SGSC) using a large population-based cohort to determine temporal patterns, identify independent survival predictors, and evaluate treatment effectiveness for optimizing clinical management. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. A total of 212 patients diagnosed with SGSC between 2011 and 2021 were included. We analyzed clinicopathological features, incidence trends, and prognostic factors using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 36.5 months, the overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 89.93% and 86.53%, respectively. The incidence of SGSC has shown a significant upward trend, increasing from an average of 6.3 cases per year in 2011-2013 to 29.3 cases per year in 2019-2021. This increase was predominantly driven by early-stage (I/II) tumors (75.9%), with the parotid gland being the most common primary site. Multivariable analysis identified age &gt; 55 years and AJCC Stage IV disease as independent poor prognostic factors. Surgical intervention, including local tumor excision and glandectomy, was significantly associated with improved overall survival. Notably, patients who received a combination of surgery and radiotherapy had better outcomes compared to those who received either treatment alone. CONCLUSION: This large-scale study with extended follow-up clarifies the rising incidence and early-stage predominance of SGSC. Age, TNM stage, and surgical treatment were identified as key prognostic factors.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study provides important insights into optimizing unilateral radiotherapy for tonsillar cancer, which could influence clinical practice, but it is a retrospective analysis without large sample size or phase trial designation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Osbourne G, Devlin A, Walsh N, Hardcastle N, Moore A, Rischin PD, Kenny PL, Porceddu PS, Wratten C, Macann A, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.058'&gt;10.1016/j.ijrobp.2025.12.058&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-09&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41520894/'&gt;41520894&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRODUCTION: Unilateral radiotherapy (URT) is an effective treatment strategy in selected patients with lateralized tonsil cancer. However, there is a lack of established planning guidelines for URT treatment leading to suboptimal optimization of contralateral and midline organs at risk (OARs). This study aimed to re-optimize URT plans to maximize sparing of midline and contralateral OAR's while maintaining target coverage, providing dosimetric guidelines for URT planning. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment plan data for patients treated with URT on XXXX were re-optimized using Eclipse V16.01. All relevant midline and OAR contours were contoured to align with international OAR consensus guidelines. Treatment plans were re-optimized, aiming for maximal midline and contralateral sparing while maintaining XXXX protocol-mandated target coverage (GTV: D100%&gt;95%; PTV: D95%&gt;95%). A second re-optimisation was performed to align with NRG acceptance criteria (PTV: D95%&gt;100%). RESULTS: All re-optimized plans achieved the XXXX and NRG protocol target volume coverage. Clinically meaningful reductions in dose to the pharyngeal constrictors (trial delivered plan vs XXXX re-optimized plan, median of mean dose, 48.5 Gy vs 37.4 Gy, estimated mean difference [ED] -9.5Gy, p&lt;0.001), contralateral submandibular gland (14.9 vs 6.7 Gy, ED -11.0, p&lt;0.001) and larynx (22.1 vs 12.1, ED -12.2, p&lt;0.001). Improvements were also seen in contralateral parotid gland (9.2 vs 4.9, ED -5.0, p&lt;0.001) and oral cavity (39.5 vs 35.9, ED -3.0, p&lt;0.001), which were considered less likely to be clinically relevant. There was no increase in dose to the ipsilateral or contralateral mandible. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this re-optimization study provide planning guidelines to guide dosimetrists and radiation oncologists on achievable OAR sparing when delivering URT.</description>

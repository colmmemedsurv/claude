      <description>&lt;h3&gt;⭐ HIGH IMPACT - Score: 80/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study involves a phase III randomized controlled trial evaluating a de-escalation strategy in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, addressing an important clinical question with potential practice-changing implications regarding treatment toxicity and efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Lovett JT, Wotman MT, Westra WH, Ahn S, Gupta V, Bakst RL, Roof S, Miles BA, Genden E, Misiukiewicz K, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107858&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-19&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41564691/'&gt;41564691&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: The rising incidence of HPV-positive oropharynx cancer (HPV-OPC) underscores the need for treatment strategies that maintain disease control while minimizing long-term toxicity. This study reports the long-term follow-up of de-escalation in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, providing critical data for future studies. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate long-term outcomes in patients with locally advanced HPV-OPC treated with induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by reduced-dose chemoradiation (rdCRT). We hypothesized that de-escalated radiation therapy after IC would be non-inferior to standard-dose CRT (sdCRT). DESIGN: Two sequential clinical trials; Quarterback (QB) 1: phase III randomized control trial, QB 2: phase II non-randomized trial; patient accrual conducted between December 2012 and February 2022; final data cutoff April 2025. Median follow-up (IQR): 88.5 (64.6-118.2) months. SETTING: Single-institution academic center. PARTICIPANTS: 62 patients with HPV-OPC were screened. 47 patients received rdCRT after IC and were included in the primary analysis. Key eligibility: smoking history ≤20 pack-years, no active smoking, no distant metastases, molecularly confirmed HPV status. INTERVENTIONS: Three cycles of induction TPF (docetaxel, cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil) followed by rdCRT (5600 cGy) with weekly carboplatin in clinical responders; non-responders in both QB trials and responders in the control arm of QB1 received sdCRT (7000 cGy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary endpoints: 3-year locoregional relapse-free survival (LRRFS) and 3-year progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary: overall survival (OS). Tertiary: disease-specific survival. RESULTS: Among 47 patients treated with rdCRT after IC, the 3-year and 5-year LRRFS were 89.3% and 86.6%. PFS was 87.2% and 84.6% at 3 and 5 years. OS was 91.5% and 89.1% at 3 and 5 years. Six patients (13%) experienced locoregional failure, and two (4%) developed distant metastases. 7/8 treatment failures (87.5%) occurred in patients with extracapsular extension. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: rdCRT following IC yields durable disease control in poor prognosis HPV-OPC, with outcomes comparable to historical benchmarks. Extended follow-up supports the safety and efficacy of this de-escalation strategy, even in patients with aggressive disease characteristics, but also underscores the need for careful patient selection, particularly in those with extracapsular extension.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This multicenter randomized phase II trial evaluates the feasibility and safety of nivolumab before chemoradiation in a high-risk population, providing important insights into treatment strategies for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, although it is not a phase III trial and the sample size is moderate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Mirghani H, Aupérin A, Even C, Larive A, Fayette J, Geoffrois L, Clatot F, Calderon B, Tao Y, Nguyen F, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1200/JCO-25-00835'&gt;10.1200/JCO-25-00835&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570275/'&gt;41570275&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PURPOSE: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and advanced stage and/or significant smoking history are at higher risk of relapse. Induction immunotherapy before chemoradiation (CRT) may improve outcomes. This randomized phase II trial assessed the feasibility and safety of induction nivolumab before CRT in this high-risk population. METHODS: Eligible patients had HPV-positive OPC with either T4 and/or N2/N3 disease or a smoking history &gt;10 pack-years. Patients were randomly assigned 1:2 to receive either standard CRT (70 Gy with cisplatin, control arm [CA], n = 20) or two infusions of nivolumab followed by CRT (experimental arm [EA], n = 41). The primary end point was the rate of patients who received full treatment in due time (FTDT), defined as (1) two nivolumab infusions on days 1 and 13-17, (2) CRT started between days 27-37 after the first nivolumab infusion, (3) no radiotherapy break ≥7 days, (4) &gt;95% of theoretical/prescribed RT dose, and (5) cisplatin dose received ≥200 mg/m2. If two patients or less in the EA failed FTDT, the strategy would be considered feasible. Secondary end points included oncologic outcomes and toxicity. RESULTS: Between July 2019 and September 2021, 62 patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 37.5 months. The primary end point was not met: four of 41 patients in EA received &lt;200 mg/m2 cisplatin. Grade 4 to 5 acute adverse events occurred only in EA, in seven patients. The 2-year cumulative incidence (95% CI) of relapse was 7.3% (1.9 to 18.0) in EA versus 15.0% (3.6 to 34.0) in CA. CONCLUSION: Induction nivolumab before CRT did not meet the predefined feasibility threshold because of reduced cisplatin dosing after toxicity in 10% of patients. The relapse incidence was numerically lower in the EA but this finding is exploratory and requires confirmation.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 75/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study evaluates a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in a significant patient population with locally advanced HPV-independent HNSCC, providing important insights into recurrence management, though it is not a randomized controlled trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruiz-Torres DA, Roberts TJ, Du P, Mendel J, Neagele S, Bonora G, Zhang F, Efthymiou V, Merkin RD, Lin DT, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837'&gt;10.1001/jamaoto.2025.4837&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41569592/'&gt;41569592&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IMPORTANCE: Recurrence rates for locally advanced human papillomavirus (HPV)-independent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are high. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV-independent HNSCC remains understudied. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay in patients with newly diagnosed locally advanced HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Between December 2020 and March 2022, among patients newly diagnosed with locally advanced HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC, ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment, within 6 weeks of completion of treatment, and during surveillance. Patients were followed up for at least 12 months after treatment completion. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were used to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive and those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors. Data were analyzed from August 2024 to March 2025. INTERVENTION: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: RFS and OS. RESULTS: Of 40 included patients, 29 (73%) were male, 38 (95%) had HPV-independent disease, and the median (IQR) age at diagnosis was 63 (28-85) years. A total of 142 samples from 40 patients. A total of 20 patients (50%) experienced recurrence. The presurgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35 of 36). MRD positivity within 6 weeks of completion of treatment was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 7.15; 95% CI, 1.44-35.34) and RFS (HR, 5.39; 95% CI, 1.98-21.07). MRD positivity during surveillance was associated with worse RFS (HR, 8.27; 95% CI, 2.03-33.64). The median (range) time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 (0.2-21.6) months. In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR, 13.84; 95% CI, 2.92-65.68) and worse OS (HR, 18.93; 95% CI, 2.27-157.70). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a noninvasive, prognostic biomarker in patients with HPV-independent HNSCC.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This systematic review and meta-analysis provides important insights into the prognostic value of the systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) in head and neck cancer, potentially influencing clinical practice, though it is based on retrospective studies and does not present novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Almeida ND, Schrand TV, Sullivan D, Yu H, Yao S, Ma SJ, Koempel A, Blakaj D, Repasky EA, Brackett CM, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107859&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579653/'&gt;41579653&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Inflammation and immune evasion are linked to tumor progression. This cancer-related inflammatory response is reflected by a biomarker named the systemic inflammatory response (SIRI). SIRI is calculated by multiplying the peripheral blood neutrophil and monocyte counts and dividing by the lymphocyte count is a biomarker that has shown prognostic capacity in squamous cell head and neck cancer. We sought to perform a meta-analysis of SIRI data for head and neck cancer. METHODS: A meta-analysis using a mixed-effects model was performed to estimate the overall effect size of prognostic capacity. The primary outcomes of interest were overall survival and progression-free survival, with effect sizes measured as log hazard ratios (HR). RESULTS: Ten studies reporting data on overall survival revealed a pooled HR of 2.4 (p &lt; 0.0001). This indicates higher SIRI patients are at greater risk of mortality relative to lower SIRI patients. Additionally, 3 studies reported metrics on progression-free survival, with a pooled HR of 2.32 (1.72, 3.13) (p &lt; 0.0001). Minimal heterogeneity was observed for progression-free survival (I2 = 0%, p&lt; 0.74). CONCLUSIONS: High SIRI portends worse overall survival. Since SIRI correlates to immune function and demonstrated minimal heterogeneity, these factors are among those most likely to be impacted by altered SIRI parameters.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;✨ NOTABLE - Score: 70/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This large retrospective study of 1,018 patients provides important insights into the incidence and treatment outcomes of carcinoma of the parotid gland, contributing valuable data to the field, although it lacks the prospective design and practice-changing findings of higher-impact studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Sandström K, Farnebo L, Hafström A, Westerborn A, Olin M, Hammerlid E, Hammarstedt-Nordenvall L, Gebre-Medhin M, Granström B, Andersson-Säll T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Oral oncology | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107863'&gt;10.1016/j.oraloncology.2026.107863&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41579652/'&gt;41579652&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTRO: Population-based studies predominantly focused on carcinoma of the parotid gland (CPG) are rare. The study aims were to analyze the incidence of CPG and to assess treatment outcomes in relation to histopathology, preoperative diagnosis and adjuvant radiotherapy. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from the Swedish Head and Neck Cancer Register (SweHNCR), including 1,018 patients diagnosed with CPG between 2008 and 2019. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence remained stable with a mean of 0.9 (range 0.65-1.08) cases per 100,000 person-years (ASR-Europe). Curative treatment was administered to 90 % of the patients, with a recurrence rate of 9 % within 3 years. The highest recurrence rates were observed in patients with salivary duct carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while patients with acinic cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas had lower recurrence rates. For stage I-II tumors, the 5-year relative survival was unaffected by whether the malignant diagnosis was known preoperatively. Male sex, increasing age, stage III-IV disease, and a World Health Organization/ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (WHO/ECOG) performance status 2-4 was independently associated with increased overall mortality risk, whereas the timing of adjuvant radiotherapy was not. CONCLUSION: This study contributes to establishing the incidence and treatment outcomes of CPG in Sweden and highlights the diverse histopathological diagnoses of these tumors. Notably, unknown malignancy at the time of surgery did not impact survival in early-stage disease, and the timing of postoperative radiotherapy was not associated with overall survival.</description>

METHODS: This study was conducted in conformity with the PRISMA statement. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to define the impact of different pathological factors on disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, enrolling 2641 patients (males: 29.5%, n = 780) with a median age of 16 years (95% CI: 15.4-19.0) years (n = 1370/2641), were included. The incidence of multifocality and ETE was 30.7% (n = 806/2625), and 45.4% (n = 1148/2528), respectively. The incidence of lateral neck lymph node metastasis (LNM) was 51.6% (n = 1224/2372). Overall, 61.5% of patients underwent postoperative radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) (n = 1381/2247). The median follow-up time was 85 months (95% CI: 57.0-176.4) (n = 2534/2641). The estimated pooled HRs for DFS were 1.86 (95% CI: 1.33-2.59; p = 0.002) for multifocality, 1.78 (95% CI: 1.20-2.63; p = 0.010) for ETE and 1.77 (95% CI: 0.76-4.11; p = 0.161) for lateral neck LNM. CONCLUSIONS: Multifocality and ETE are significant predictors of recurrence in pediatric PTC, while lateral neck LNM does not seem to be a reliable prognostic factor. These results may warrant consideration in pediatric-specific risk stratification and help guide treatment and follow-up.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This study utilizes a large national database to analyze clinical variables associated with microscopic positive margins in oropharyngeal cancer, providing important insights into treatment outcomes, though it is a retrospective analysis and does not present novel therapeutic findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Tucker A, Bollig CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/ohn.70100'&gt;10.1002/ohn.70100&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-26&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41582733/'&gt;41582733&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OBJECTIVE: The objective was to identify clinical variables associated with microscopic positive margins (PMs) during transoral robotic surgery (TORS) for oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) resection, and to explore the association of the receipt of adjuvant treatment with overall survival (OS) in this population. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis. SETTING: 2019 Patient User File of the National Cancer Database. METHODS: Patients &gt;18 years of age with OPC were stratified based on margin status. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify clinical variables associated with PM. Survival analyses were performed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and hazard ratios (aHRs) with associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated. RESULTS: In total, 4294 patients met the criteria. The PM rate was 16.6%. Human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative squamous cell carcinoma (SCCa), salivary gland carcinoma, clinical T category, base of tongue primary site, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with PM. PMs were associated with increased mortality (aHR 1.67, 95% CI: 1.40-1.99). In patients with PM, but without extranodal extension (ENE), adjuvant radiation therapy (aRT) (aHR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19-0.45) and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (aCRT) (aHR 0.31, 95% CI: 0.21-0.45) were associated with an improvement in OS versus surgery alone; however, OS between aRT and aCRT was similar for both HPV-positive and HPV-negative SCCa. CONCLUSION: Histologic type, clinical T category, tumor subsite, and treatment at low-volume, nonacademic institutions were independently associated with TORS PM. aCRT did not confer a survival benefit over aRT in the overall cohort, or in subgroups of HPV-associated or HPV-negative SCCa patients with PM without ENE.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; This randomized controlled trial evaluates a novel approach to improve cervical range of motion in post-operative neck dissection patients, providing important insights into quality of life, although the sample size is small and the findings may not be broadly generalizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Ruangprasertkul S, Teeramatwanich W, Kasemsiri P, Ratanaanekchai T, Naruekon J, Sirasaporn P, Laohasiriwong S, Vatanasapt P&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Head &amp; neck | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.70174'&gt;10.1002/hed.70174&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-23&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41574675/'&gt;41574675&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BACKGROUND: Advanced head and neck and thyroid cancers often involve cervical lymph nodes and require neck dissection, causing pain and reduced neck/shoulder mobility. We developed a video-guided neck exercise to maintain mobility and improve quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Patients who underwent neck dissection (August 1, 2022-November 1, 2023) were randomized into groups using video-guided exercise (n = 21) or printed leaflets (n = 19). Cervical range of motion (CROM) and QOL were measured before surgery. Exercise started on postoperative day 7, and follow-up was conducted at weeks 2 and 12. RESULTS: Of the 40 participants, 36 completed the study (18/group). At week 2, both groups showed reduced CROM without between-group differences. By week 12, the video group improved in flexion and extension, whereas the leaflet group decreased (p = 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively). Other motions and QOL were unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend video-guided neck exercise for patients undergoing neck dissection, with specialist-supervised training to ensure proper technique and improve clinical outcomes.</description>

      <description>&lt;h3&gt;📌 SELECTED - Score: 65/100&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why this matters:&lt;/b&gt; The study identifies a novel mechanism of chemoresistance in nasopharyngeal carcinoma linked to IDH1 and DHODH, providing important insights into metabolic reprogramming; however, it is primarily a mechanistic study without immediate clinical application or large sample size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authors:&lt;/b&gt; Zhao Y, Ou C, Huang H, Wang Y, Shen J, Li Y, He Q, Han Z, Xie Y, Zhong T, et al.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Journal:&lt;/b&gt; Cancer research | &lt;b&gt;DOI:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2313'&gt;10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-25-2313&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Published:&lt;/b&gt; 2026-Jan-22&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;PMID:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href='https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41570327/'&gt;41570327&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Metabolic reprogramming under therapeutic stress may represent a targetable vulnerability for cancer treatment. Elucidation of the metabolic alterations linked to chemotherapy in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) could uncover potential therapeutic strategies. Using proteomics and transcriptomic profiles, we identified wild-type IDH1 as a crucial metabolic enzyme upregulated in gemcitabine plus cisplatin chemotherapy (GP)-resistant NPC. IDH1 reprogrammed nucleotide metabolism in response to chemotherapy, linking DNA damage repair (DDR) to ferroptosis resistance via DHODH, thereby contributing to chemoresistance in NPC. Mechanistically, α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a metabolite of IDH1, enhanced chromatin accessibility to promote DHODH transcription via α-KG-dependent dioxygenase ALKBH5-recruited HNRNPC. The DHODH inhibitor BAY2402234 markedly sensitized NPC cells to chemotherapy. Clinically, a prognostic model based on DDR and ferroptosis signatures effectively predicted disease relapse risk post-chemotherapy in NPC. This study links DDR to ferroptosis defense via the IDH1/α-KG/ALKBH5/DHODH axis, suggesting DHODH inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome chemoresistance in tumors harboring wild-type IDH1.</description>
